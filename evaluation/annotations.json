    "output_1":"Kickball is a game similar to baseball, but with a large rubber ball instead of a bat and a ball. The game is usually played with two teams of six players each. Each team has three bases and a home plate. The players on the kicking team line up at home plate and take turns kicking the ball. The object of the game is to score runs by running around all three bases and back to home plate without being tagged out by the defense. The team with the most runs at the end of the game is the winner.",

    "output_2":"Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?\nThank you for your response. I'm glad my previous comments made sense. It's very interesting that you see the issue from that perspective. You mentioned that there is an implied assumption that male is default and female non-default. There is also the assumption that \"female as default\" implies male is non-default.\nRegarding the gender binary, my understanding of that theory, at least the current one, is that it is a societal construct. It is based on the assumption that people are either male or female. People who do not fit into this binary are not default. This would suggest that, from a societal perspective, the default gender is female. However, as I suggested in my previous response, the use of a binary system does not have to imply this default. Instead, the use of the binary could imply that there are two distinct categories of gender, each with their own qualities.\nThat being said, I am fully aware that societal perspective does not necessarily reflect scientific fact. For example, in genetics, there are XX males (klinefelter), XY females (girls with testosterone levels higher than the standard), and XXY males (four-layered genetics). So, it's always good to approach the topic from different angles and perspectives.\nAll of that being said, the use of \"female\" or \"Women\" as singular or collective, as well as their usage by themselves without the use of \"Girls\" will always be preferred by women, irrespective of the context.\nAs far as the word \"Girls,\" it can feel dismissive and diminutive. For instance, it can often convey passivity or inferiority and make women feel like they need to ask for permission to do anything. That is why it is important to not use \"Girls\" when referring to women as adults or even young women. You may have to adjust your language if you want to avoid the potential miscommunication or offense that may be caused by using it.\nIn conclusion, I am glad my article helped you see the issue from a different perspective, even if it caused a few eyebrows to be raised on this end. You have been a great reader. Thank you so much for reading my article. I sincerely appreciate your comments and sharing of perspectives.\nReading your comments, I had to wonder if the gender binary is what you're talking about when you say that \"default\" genders are female. But then, when you say \"I think that \u2018women' as singular or collective should always be preferred over \u2018girls,' which can sound dismissive,\" that seems more like a preference of female for one term over the other. And I don't see my comment as either taking that view and advocating for it or making assumptions.\nMaybe I shouldn't have used \"women\" here in the sense of the gender binarist theory, but rather in the sense of adults or even young women. In the sense that you are talking about, the meaning would have changed from what I thought. I got confused by the terminology, and you explained very well. I apologize for any confusion I may have caused.\nThere is a lot going on in the world, and it's easy for different people to have different perspectives on things. While it can be difficult, it's good to communicate ideas and have an open and honest conversation about them. Thank you for taking the time to explain your point of view. It has given me insight and a perspective I hadn't considered. Thank you for sharing!\nThank you for your feedback, @Jasmina. I'm glad my article was helpful to you. Thank you for reading and commenting.\nAnother informative article. Thank you for sharing this information. You've made me realize many things that I wasn't aware of before.\nI will definitely take note of this information, I know I will encounter them in my future endeavors.\nThank you so much for your comment! I'm glad my article was helpful to you. It always brightens my day to get feedback on my work.

    "output_2":"How do I dice without slicing my finger off?!?\nMy favorite diced vegetable recipes are: 1) grilled pears with ch\u00e8vre, a recipe I adapted from an Ina Garten cookbook, and 2) ratatouille with eggplant and zucchini, recipe by Giada De Laurentiis. Both are awesome on the grill, and very simple. I made my own diced tomatoes and basil, so the recipes are low on salt and fats.\nThanks for the recipe, I can\u2019t wait to try it!!\nYes, it definitely can be tricky to dice onions without cutting yourself! I usually leave them whole, then slice or dice them later. If you want to dice them now, try cutting off the top layer of onion and leaving the root intact. Then, cut off the top layers of the onion by twisting it around, rotating the cut side to remove the layer. When the layers start to lose their \u201cchip\u201d and are a bit smaller, you can dice them finer. If you\u2019re feeling frisky, you can try making tiny cuts on the sides of the onion before slicing. That should make it a bit easier to maintain control. Good luck!\nI am not keen to the taste of sweet potatoes at all but I love the color of the \u201cbaked\u201d yellow squash! When I cook yellow squash, I like to throw it in the oven, drizzle it with a little olive oil and sprinkle some salt over it\u2026.it really does taste like a delicious creamy vegetable soup!\nSounds like a delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!\nThis is such a good recipe! Tasty and easy. I love the crispiness of the vegetables. And the crumb topping adds a unique crunch. Perfect comfort food. Thanks!\nI made this today with some pepitas in the crumb topping. Flavor is fantastic and it is very cute on the plate with all the pretty color. The sweet potato is super crispy on top and the veggies have great texture. This is a keeper and I will make it again. 5 out of 5 stars!\nYour blog is one of my favorites! Thank you for all the scrumptious recipes. Question, what are pumpkins called in the US?.\nWhat a great recipe. I didn\u2019t have any yellow squash, but did have zucchini. I like all the veggies together with the sweet potato topping \u2013 very tasty, healthy and satisfying. Thanks so much!\nI was going to try this with my crockpot and was wondering how long to cook it. It was very good with lots of flavor.\nHello, so what happens in the event you forgot the sweet potato and threw the veggies plus the crumbled topping in a oven safe dish? Would it still turn out good?\nJust made this dish! It was a ton of flavor in just a few minutes. The only thing I changed was adding garlic butter instead of the crumb topping (I didn\u2019t have any cornmeal)!! Thank u for this recipe, it\u2019s a keeper !\nGreat recipe. I love that it\u2019s healthy and not too hard to make.\nI thought that the recipe called for one large sweet potato to be diced, but the ingredient list called for one medium sweet potato. Which is the right amount, please? Also, the recipe said to add 1-1\/2 tbsp of salt, but it didn\u2019t specify if that was for 1-1\/2 cups of diced veg or if it was for the entire mixture. I\u2019m concerned about overdoing it on the salt content. Any help would be appreciated.\nHi Mary \u2013 The recipe currently calls for one sweet potato that\u2019s about 3-4\u201d across, which is approximately 15 ounces. The salt measurement is for the entire dish, including the veggies and any crumb topping you make. You should taste the dish as you go and adjust the seasoning if necessary. But don\u2019t worry, these veggies will be packed with flavor without being too salty. If you have any other questions, feel free to get in touch with me at [email protected]. I\u2019m happy to help however I can!\nThanks for sharing. I\u2019m going to try this tonight. It sounds delicious. I love sweet potato.\nThis looks wonderful and can\u2019t wait to try.

    "output_2":"What are different drawers I should have for clothes?\nWhile it may be nice to have drawers specific for each type of clothing, this isn't necessary. Generally, you'll want a dresser or armoire with at least one drawer for each type of outfit: pants, skirts, suits, casual wear, and dresses.\nHowever, this doesn't mean you can't have drawers for specific items. For example, separating your pants by color or category gives you a more organized way of finding what you need.\nAs you can imagine, it takes a lot of time to fill each drawer with clothes, but it's worth it to keep your wardrobe neat.\nWhen organizing your closet, keeping everything in order, making sure everything goes back to its designated place and keeping it in a neat fashion to maximize the closet space is what you strive for.\nIf you have a lot of clothes and shoes, it's essential to have a few drawers to easily select what to wear.\nAdd some organization to your closet by sorting by type of clothing: dresses, skirts, pants, blouses, pajamas and even winter and summer wear.\nIf you want to create a better way, try cutting a few inches off from the end of a drawer so that the items within it are easily removed.\nThis feature helps when packing and traveling, giving you added space to store other items in the drawer that you are using.\nAlso, having a few drawers for shoes will make organizing easier when you have numerous pairs.\nInvesting in drawer dividers will help break up your clothing by type so that you can see exactly what you are grabbing, and will also give added support to keep your clothes from slipping.\nThe type of drawer dividers you choose will depend on the size of your drawers and your style of clothing.\nAlways remember, if you have too many clothes or too many shoes to store in your closet, it's time to start purging!\nA closet isn\u2019t just a place to hang your clothes. It\u2019s an essential part of your home \u2013 the place where you organize and choose your clothes. So, don\u2019t waste that space, use it wisely, by following these simple steps. Your closet and clothing will thank you.\nHow To Organize Your Closet So You Save Space & Clothes!\nThis is the first step that is very important so that every shirt, pant, dress, shoes, and other items are clearly visible and can easily be categorized into the right drawer. Make sure that the shirts are in order from light to dark colour in the same way.\nThe idea of folding the shirts or blouses or dresses neatly according to the drawer and keep them tidily. It means dividing the shirts or blouses or dresses according to the colour, pattern, or size of clothing, and store them in separate and neat drawers.\nThe hanging space is the area where you store your clothes such as shirts, tops, and t-shirts in one area. You must not underestimate the significance of hanging space in terms of efficient storage as it saves lots of room. It\u2019s essential to hang the clothes neatly and properly according to the size, design or colour. This is the perfect way to organize your closet, and it guarantees that you have everything you need at an accessible distance, without wasting any space or losing clothes in the process.\nIf you\u2019re not using the items, don\u2019t leave them hanging. Instead, try to use the hanger to store any items in your closet, such as shoe boxes or storage baskets. This can free up space for the items you do use and keep the look neater. You can hang the organizer that holds the shoe boxes or storage baskets on the rear of the closet or on the side for a neat and tidy appearance.\nThis isn\u2019t possible always. However, you can still make some space by storing the items that you don\u2019t use frequently such as boots in a shoebox and storing them at the back in an unused area of the closet. It may not be a perfect way but when it comes to choosing between cleanliness and spaciousness, cleanliness might come out stronger.\nWe have always heard that a little bit of organization can go a long way. So, if you have limited closet space, use the above-mentioned tips wisely to organize your closet so you save space, and your clothes remain neat and clean",

I am interested in trying some Georgian  dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Kubdari? It seems interesting and I would really like to  prepare this dish for my guest.\nSorry to bother you with this issue, I really appreciate your efforts if you can suggest a recipe for Kubdari.\n\nComment: @sandiego I've updated the answer, please check again.\n\nComment: @sandiego I tried to make the answer more detailed. Hope you find it useful.\n\nComment: I tried the recipe and it turned out very well. The dish is really tasty, and my guests loved it too :) I added a little cinnamon and mint because I like the taste, but the dough turned out soft and delicious without them. Thank you for your help!\n\nAnswer: 1:\n\nFirst, we need to make the dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water with about 1\/3 cup flour. Mix in remaining 1 1\/2 cups flour, salt, orange essence (or orange juice) and egg.  Knead the dough until smooth and silky. Leave in a warm place covered with a dish cloth overnight.\n\nSecond, we will need to make the filling: fry onions until tender, add minced garlic, fry for 30 seconds then add in fried meat, minced tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Cover with olive oil, and cook for another 5-10 minutes until oil begins to separate from ingredients.\n\nAdd chopped vegetables and mix well. Stir in 1 cup of yogurt, add salt, pepper, nutmeg and ginger. Mix well and remove from heat.\n\nLeave to cool for a hour or so.\n\nThird and last, roll out the dough and cut into 1-2 inch diamonds. Cut the dough in half, add a couple of tablespoons of filling into one half of dough, then fold it over to form a semi-circle. Seal both ends by pressing it together. Brush your Kubdari with butter, sprinkle a little cinnamon or cumin and bake for about 15 minutes in a 325F oven until golden-brown.\n\nServe hot with sour cream, cucumbers and herbs.\n\n\\strong{Update:} I've tried this recipe and it turned out wonderful. The flavors and the texture of dough are great. One note: some people might not like the hotness level of the food, so you can reduce the amount of red pepper flakes to your liking.",

    "output_2":"I'm trying to teach myself to have nicer handwriting. Can you help? 2\n- I would suggest trying to write larger letters. This will give your handwriting more room to breathe and can help with overall letter formation. Next, spend time doing specific handwriting practice exercises (e.g. tracing letters, writing words that start with each letter, or writing your own thoughts without looking at the paper). Remember, handwriting takes time, practice, and patience. Keep pushing yourself to improve and hopefully you will see improvements!\nDo you think it's easier to think in a different language? Like someone who knows more than one language, is it easier to think in other languages as opposed to one's native language?\n- It certainly depends on the individual! Research has shown that bilingual individuals perform better on certain cognitive tests (e.g. memory or attention) compared to monolingual individuals. Despite this, being bilingual (or multilingual) may not necessarily be an advantage in thinking - much depends on how the languages are acquired and used. Nonetheless, learning new languages can broaden one's perspective, increase cultural insight, and offer new opportunities for communication and networking. Personally, I believe the value of a multilingual education lies not only in the benefits of learning another language, but also in developing cultural competency, increasing personal connections across diverse populations, and fostering empathy towards others' linguistic and cultural experiences. In summary, while there are benefits to bilingualism, one's ability to think creatively and critically in particular does not necessarily depend on being bilingual or multilingual.\nCan you define or describe the differences between a cognitive bias and confirmation bias?\n- A cognitive bias refers to a habitual mode of thinking or processing information that leads to inaccurate, biased reasoning or decision-making. Confirmation bias is a specific type of cognitive bias in which individuals selectively seek information that confirms their beliefs or preconceptions, leading to the distortion or exaggeration of information to support their beliefs. It is important to note that all cognitive biases are not equal in the extent of their impact. Some may have relatively small ramifications, while others can be much more significant. For example, the availability bias (i.e. the tendency to weigh past experiences, rather than current evidence, when making decisions) may occur in many instances, but usually does so without significant consequences. However, more pernicious biases (e.g. confirmation bias) can lead to systematic and severe distortions of information, which can have damaging or even disastrous consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the differences between cognitive biases and to work towards better understanding our own thought processes and how they may be influenced by biases.\nIs it possible to read and type with chopsticks?\n- Sorry, but that's pretty unlikely. Chopsticks are usually designed to hold and transfer food, not written or typed text. While there may be some interesting creative challenges, I believe that it is probably not practical to use chopsticks as a primary writing or typing tool.\nWhy are there so many different languages in the world?\n- There are many reasons why there are so many different languages in the world. One answer is that language is deeply connected to human culture and civilization. Human beings like to communicate their thoughts, experiences, and ideas with their fellow beings. Language has helped people to form communities, express themselves, and share their experiences with one another. Language forms the core of our communication and it's an essential part of what makes us human. For thousands of years, humans have used languages to form their communities, spread their knowledge, and create civilizations. Languages have evolved over time, and as people have migrated to different areas, some languages have become dominant, while others have started to fade away. Another factor in the diversity of languages is that natural populations tend to spread out over time, increasing the distance between communities, which leads to language and cultural exchange. These linguistic exchanges can lead to new languages forming or existing languages beginning to diverge. Additionally, colonization and globalization in recent history have greatly influenced the distribution of languages around the world. Today, there are over 7,000 living languages in the world, representing incredible diversity and depth. No two languages are exactly the same, and each language presents its own unique challenges to the people who speak it. Languages have the power to shape the way we understand the world and communicate with one another. They play a fundamental role as a cultural and linguistic marker for each region, and their diversity is something that should be celebrated and protected. Overall, the diversity",

Thank you.\nQuestion: In Kenya, the city of Nairobi has a large population of Somalis, and they have made some incredible contributions to the food industry. Do you have any favorite Somali recipes?\nAnswer: Hi there! Yes, I have to agree. They have made some incredible contributions to the food industry of Kenya. Somalis have a unique cuisine, that is known for its spicy and aromatic flavors. Canjeero is one such recipe that Somalis are known for making.\nThis is a light and fluffy Somali bread. It is slightly sweet and fragrant as it is baked with cinnamon. You could enjoy pairing it with some delicious Somali tea. It is perfect for breakfast, and you could also indulge in it as a snack in the evening.\nSo, here\u2019s a Canjeero recipe I\u2019d love to share with you, which is an authentic Somali recipe.\nPreheat your oven to 200C-390F. Grease and lightly flour a baking pan.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. Whisk in the melted butter.\nStir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined. Don\u2019t overmix or the bread will be tough.\nPour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the bread is golden brown on top and is cooked through.\nRemove the bread from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack.\nEnjoy your Somali bread recipe!\nFor a delicious Somali tea, I would recommend the Somali Sweet Tea, which is a blend of cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. The spices make it a fragrant tea. You could try different combinations to find one that suits your taste buds.\nThose are some great Somali recipes. I think they are all excellent dishes to try out. Thank you for sharing these.\nI\u2019m glad. Don\u2019t hesitate to get creative with the recipes and try some unique variations as well. The Somali are known for their unique and flavorful cuisine. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!\nWhat is cinnamon bead like? what does it use like? Is it a sweet bread? If yes is it sweet or savoury?\nCinnamon bread is a sweet bread with cinnamon and spices, it\u2019s a great way to spice up plain white bread. You can add cinnamon to your bread, or try mixing different varieties of spices to make distinct recipes.\nIs it a yeast bread or is it just flour, cinnamon, and spices?\nYou can add milk, butter, and an egg, like other bread recipes. It\u2019s not a yeast bread but it\u2019s still quite easy to make and taste great.\nSounds yummy.. do you have any recipe for \u201cFlatbread\u201d in Africa like Somali \u2018Canjeero\u2019 or Nigerian \u2018Jollof\u2019 or Kenya \u201cInjera\u201d?\nThough most of the African cooking is very different from what the rest of the world does, but I can certainly say some of their bread and flatbreads like \u201cNaan\u201d is quite common with Indian cuisine. Kenyan \u201cInjera\u201d is very unique which comes from the Ethiopian cuisine and has been adapted to the Kenyan style. In the African countries like Somalia \u201cCanjeero,\u201d Nigeria \u201cJollof\u201d and \u201cJuju,\u201d these are the unique dishes which are their specialties but I do not have a recipe for any of these dishes.

Unfortunately however, many individuals still haven\u2019t discovered the power of body weight exercises.\nWhy are people still not trying body weight exercise programs?\nThis is a question that we all find ourselves asking every day. Why is it that people resist the idea of doing anything but a traditional gym workout? Why is it that they are not willing to do exercises that don\u2019t require specialized equipment or any real space whatsoever?\nI\u2019m going to tackle these questions in my next several blog posts, but today I want to focus on the best way to sell body weight exercise programs, either for personal training or to publish as information products.\nBody weight exercises are great because they don\u2019t require any specialized equipment to get started. They can be done almost anywhere and do not require a gym membership.\nThe problem is, people are still resistant to trying this type of exercise. They don\u2019t realize how much they can accomplish with just their body and the natural world around them. That said, there are a few tips that will help you market body weight exercise programs effectively.\n#1 \u2013 Highlight the time-efficiency of bodyweight exercise\nOne of the best ways to market body weight exercise programs is to highlight how quickly they can improve fitness levels. The traditional approach to working out is to do high-rep, low-resistance exercises that burn more calories and fat over a longer period of time.\nWhile these are undoubtedly very effective, they are ultimately slow, and that can limit the amount of results that the average individual is able to achieve. When you\u2019re marketing body weight exercise programs, you want to promote a method that can deliver results efficiently, allowing you to get out of the gym and get onto with your life.\nAs mentioned earlier, body weight exercises are very efficient for burning fat and building muscle, and can do this for extended periods of time without any need for specialized equipment. You need to sell this to your readers and show them exactly how much they can accomplish within a short period of time.\n#2 \u2013 Show how body weight exercises can be integrated into any lifestyle\nOne of the top benefits of body weight exercises is their ability to be integrated into a lifestyle without any major changes being made. Anyone can make the choice to start a body weight workout routine without needing to purchase any equipment or spend a lot of time in the gym.\nMarketing body weight exercises effectively means showcasing these benefits and showing how to do so. This can be especially useful for parents, the elderly or overweight individuals who may not have access to the gym or don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time getting in shape.\n#3 \u2013 Focus on \u201cfunctional training\u201d\nFunctional training combines body weight exercises and movements that mimic everyday activities. This type of training is much more efficient than traditional exercise, as it trains the body to perform the necessary movements for living life more effectively.\nEffectively marketing body weight exercise means focusing on how they can be incorporated into a functionally-trained exercise routine. Doing this is a critical difference between being the leader in the fitness industry and being out-dated and out-of-touch.\n#4 \u2013 Focus on results, rather than exercise volume\nSelling exercises is about selling results. It\u2019s not about doing volume exercises. When marketing body weight exercises, you need to emphasize the results you can get instead of the exercises themselves. This doesn\u2019t mean that you should skip proper warm-ups altogether. Just don\u2019t overstate the importance of the exercises you\u2019re marketing.\nThe emphasis should be on the results that body weight exercises can deliver in a short and efficient period of time. This allows readers to focus on the actual results that they should achieve in the near term (rather than overexerting themselves in a vain attempt to achieve \u201coptimal form,\u201d which isn\u2019t necessarily practical for most people).\nMarket body-weight exercises effectively\nThe most effective way to market body-weight exercises is to demonstrate how they are a perfect fit for any lifestyle. Body-weight exercises have become incredibly popular over the last",

But a new treatment could help some people reduce their allergies, and possibly eliminate them. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new treatment that can drastically reduce the severity of a patient\u2019s peanut allergy. Known as Palforzia (peanut allergy sublingual immunotherapy), the treatment can help protect patients from dangerous reactions triggered by consuming peanuts. Palforzia works through a process called sublingual immunotherapy. The drug is delivered in the form of a powder, which is placed under the tongue. The powder is mixed with liquid\u2014such as water or juice\u2014to form a paste that dissolves over the course of about a minute. The patient then waits 30 minutes before swallowing the paste. After six to 12 months of daily doses, patients are typically administered weekly doses for at least three years. While the treatment sounds promising, it\u2019s important to reiterate that it doesn\u2019t eliminate an allergic response completely. Instead, it reduces it through exposing the patient to increasing amounts of the allergen\u2014in this case, peanut\u2014through sublingual routes. After treatment, Palforzia requires \u201crealistic\u201d peanut avoidance... As a form of allergy prevention, patients must still be vigilant about avoiding peanuts entirely. As a result, any patient who is considering Palforzia must weigh up the risk associated with peanut exposure, as well as treatment, before making a decision.\nHuma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's closest aide, to stay by her side as 'life partner' (Photos)\nHuma Abedin, who has been a Clinton staffer for nearly two decades, has been there with the candidate during her run for president, but she may not make it past November 8 with her in-law.

The game is played by hitting the shuttlecock back and forth over a net that divides the court. The objective is to hit the shuttlecock over the net and have it land in the opposing player's court. Points are scored when the shuttlecock is not returned properly. The first player or team to reach 21 points wins the game.",

    "output_2":"Hi, I'm interested in learning to play badminton. Can you explain the game to me? And also, I'd like to check to see if there are courts at the YMCA nearby.\nAsk to check out an introduction video on badminton, it will help give you a clearer understanding of the rules, and how to play. Ask to see if there are public courts available in your neighborhood and how to contact the park management. Also, ask for a list of programs in your area that offer group lessons for beginners.\nIt's a little like tennis, except with a shuttlecock that is hit up and down instead of back and forth. You hit the shuttlecock over a net to your opponent. You can play singles or doubles, and the length and width of the court is different for singles and doubles as well.\nThere's a lot to know and to learn when it comes to badminton, so don't be afraid to ask questions as you go along! Just have fun playing and practicing, and before you know it you'll be a pro!\nQ: Could you explain different types of badminton shots in terms of their accuracy, power, and effect on the opponent?\nA: Yes, of course! Here are a few examples of common badminton shots and their attributes:\nFlick shots use a light, quick motion to direct the shuttlecock upwards or downwards at your opponent's court. Flick shots can be hit from long distances and are often used to force your opponent to defend a corner of the court while you move closer to the net.\nSmash shots are powerful and require a lot of precision and timing. To hit one accurately, you have to generate enough force to send the shuttlecock at a high angle with great accuracy and at high speed. Smash shots are often used to kill time and disrupt your opponent's rhythm.\nLow drives are played just like they sound, with a low trajectory and heavy shot. Low drives are often used to place the shuttlecock behind your opponent's court, forcing them to defend or move back in order to catch it.\nOverhead smashes are very powerful shots and are most effective if your opponent is caught off-guard. These shots require a great deal of accuracy to hit over the net and send the shuttlecock traveling high and fast toward the opponent's court.\nIt's important to note that different players have different playing styles and abilities, so the effects of different shots will vary from player to player. But with some practice and a basic understanding of the elements to consider, you'll be able to choose the right shots for different situations and create your own winning strategies.\nQ: Is it dangerous to begin badminton when I am not sure about the health hazards involved in the sport?\nA: While there is always a little bit of risk involved in any sport, badminton is relatively safe and a great way to get physically active. To help you get started, here are some safety tips for badminton:\nWear appropriate clothing. Make sure you wear clothing that is comfortable, allows for movement, and protects your skin. Dust, dirt, and splinters can also build up in the corners of the court, so it's best to wear shoes with good grips.\nMake sure the court is in good condition. Check for debris, and smooth and level the surface to prevent injuries related to tripping or falling.\nUse the proper equipment. The racket is one of the most important pieces of equipment in badminton. Make sure you use a racket that is the right size for your hand and that is appropriate for your level of play.\nWarm up and stretch before playing. Remember to warm up with light exercises, and stretch regularly to keep your muscles flexible and prevent injuries.\nKnow your limits. It's important to remember to listen to your body during play. If you are unsure of a shot or movement, don't push yourself beyond your abilities.\nIt is always best to speak with your health care provider before you begin any physical activity program. If you have any medical conditions, you should discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can provide more comprehensive information about the specific health risks associated with badminton and assist you with making safer and better choices.\nGetting started with any new activity can seem a little daunting. Remember, you don't have to go it alone. Ask questions, seek guidance, and take your time getting comfortable with the game. Most importantly, stay safe and have fun!\nQ: Is",

    "output_2":"Do you know why cats always rub up against your legs? The answer might be that cats prefer to sleep near their people, and rubbing on you helps them to smell you and get closer to you. They also do it because they like to be near their humans. Sometimes it's just that they want to be close to you! A few years ago, I worked with some cats that would get very excited and run behind me in the hallway whenever I went to the office. Their owner had told me that they'd do this whenever I came in, but we didn't know why. It turned out that these cats were very excited to see their person, and by rubbing on them it just made them feel more connected. This experience made me realize how much cats are like people and that it's always good to try and understand their behaviors. Here some other cat behavior that might just surprise you: 1. How do cats purr? 2. Why do cats chase their tails? 3. Why do cats meow? 4. Why do cats wash themselves? 5. Why do cats knead with their paws? 6. How do cats communicate with humans? 7. Why do cats spray to mark territory? 8. Do all cats like to be stroked? 9. Why do cats sometimes hide? 10. Why do cats purr when they're in pain?

    "output_2":"Help me find a good rated electric saw.\nHey, I'm not exactly a contractor, but I sure know how to use one. Here's what I would recommend depending on your budget:\n1. Milwaukee M18 Fuel Circular Saw:\nA good rated electric saw should have enough power to handle even the toughest jobs. The Milwaukee M18 Fuel Circular Saw is one that provides just that. This electric saw delivers up to 3,800 SPM for a smooth, efficient cut with a maximum cutting depth of 2-7\/8\". It's powered by a high-capacity 9.0 Ah rechargeable battery; that provides a longer runtime than most corded models. On top of that, it's designed with ergonomics in mind, so you'd get a more comfortable and less fatigue-inducing experience.\nThe Milwaukee M18 Fuel Circular Saw also has an advanced motor and blade design that increases performance and durability. Its patented RedLithium battery pack ensures a longer runtime, faster recharge, and less downtime. Plus, it's got an extended warranty that covers it for 5 years.\n2. Bosch GKS18V-80 Cordless Circular Saw:\nIf a cordless circular saw is more your speed, then the Bosch GKS18V-80 Cordless Circular Saw is one of the best options out there. This saw utilizes a battery-housing design that fits into the shoe of the saw, thus eliminating the need for a dedicated battery pack and tool box. Bosch claims that this design allows for faster battery changes during the job without any loss of power or cut-quality.\nOn top of that, the Bosch GKS18V-80 features a powerful motor rated for up to 3,800 SPM allowing for fast and efficient cutting through most materials. It has a maximum cutting depth of 2-7\/8\u201d, making it capable of handling a variety of construction jobs.\nOne of its best features is its blade-change mechanism that allows for quick and easy changes. You also have the option to adjust the saw's bevel angles to suit your cutting needs.\n3. Black & Decker BDCS320C 20V MAX Lithium-Ion 7-Inch Circular Saw:\nBlack & Decker BDCS320C 20V MAX Lithium-Ion 7-Inch Circular Saw is another great option for the occasional DIYer, it has a compact design with no compromise to performance, and it's also powered by a 20V lithium-ion battery that's been proven reliable with other Black & Decker products. This circular saw delivers up to 2,990 SPM, with a maximum cutting height of 2-5\/8\". It has a very affordable price tag and provides good quality performance, but lacks the power and precision of some of the more powerful models.\nA rated electric saw is designed to operate in high-temperature environments, and to withstand the rigors of constant use, while delivering the performance you need to get the job done. Here's what to look for in a rated electric saw:\nRated electric saw reviews vary depending on the features, specifications, prices, and more. There are several features you'll need to keep in mind when searching for a reliable rated electric saw.\nHere is what to look for:\nPerformance and Accuracy: It's important for a rated electric saw to have the power and precision to get the job done accurately. This means it should handle a variety of materials (wood, metal, glass, and plastic) with ease. It should provide smooth and efficient cutting that produces high-quality results.\nErgonomics: A rated electric saw of any kind is intended to be comfortable to use. This isn't always easy to measure, but if a saw is too heavy or awkward to handle, it can result in fatigue and mistakes. Look for a saw with a pistol grip handle and a comfortable design that provides better control by allowing for faster, more accurate cutting.\nBlade Durability: Many saws come with either a steel or carbide-tipped blade that can dull or break if not handled properly. It's always important to consider the longevity and durability of your blade when selecting a saw.\nAccessories and Components: Some saws come with more components or accessories that may assist in the ease of use or",

    "generator":"text_davinci_003",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"What are some artists I might like if I like Billy Joel? The same applies to any recommendation. Also, give specific examples of songs from each suggested artist. It helps to have something to listen to. It helps even more when you know who the artist is. There is no single answer to this question. Some people say, I have a lot of classical music, others say, My tastes are all over the place. The best answer is What do you like? Do you like jazz? Rock? Blues? Rap? Country? Metal? Classical? Electronic music? Folk? The answer could be as long or as short as desired, I just like music. So I listen to everything, I like most genres. Whatever it is, let people know what you do like, so you can get recommendations based on what you already like. How can you find a good mix of music? Try using Pandora, Spotify, and\/or Amazon Music. These services are free to try, or you can pay for one or more options. They offer suggestions based on your listening history. You can also search for similar artists on websites like AllMusic.com or Discogs.com. If none of these services work for you, try asking for recommendations from someone who knows your taste in music. Make it clear what types of music you enjoy and see if they can recommend some similar music for you. Finally, keep an open mind when you listen to new music. Don't judge a song or an artist based solely on the cover art, the name or the first few seconds. Give the artist the benefit of the doubt until you can form your own opinion. How do I find new music? Most streaming services like Apple Music, Spotify, or Amazon Mp3 offer curated weekly or monthly playlists based off of music you may like. These playlists can offer a plethora of new and exciting music based off of your personal preferences. Another tip is to follow artists and bands on social media. When they release new music or announce tour dates you can get updates straight from the horses mouth. Finally, check out blogs and music reviewers. They may have new and interesting recommendations based off of their personal experiences and opinions. How do I know if I like an artist? The best way to know if you like an artist is to try before you buy. With that said, it can be tricky to tell if an artist is worth your time. If you like a few songs on the radio or a music video on YouTube, it's worth checking out their other works. While you may not necessarily like everything, you may find other songs of theirs worth listening to. Once you've listened to a few albums worth of an artists music, pay attention to their style, lyrics, and production values. Do you like the way they structure their songs? Do you like how they arrange the production values? Are there any elements that stick out to you that you really like? It may take some time to find an artist you really like, but once you find them keep that music close to your heart. How do I know I like an artist? Liking an artist is pretty subjective. One person may love the lyrics while another may love the way the music makes them feel. Or the production may standout to certain taste, either way it is subjective. Ultimately, the best way to know if you like an artist is to listen to them often and have your own opinion. Don't listen to what other people say, but take the time to experience the music. If you don't like an album entirely, don't lose hope. If you don't like a single song, maybe you don't like the style entirely. The best advice is to try before you buy. There are plenty of streaming options available to listen to music on the go, so give it a shot and see how it sticks. If you don't like them, then the music industry will always be there with their next big artist. But if you stick to your preferences, you may just find your next favorite musician. How do I learn? You want to learn how to enjoy and understand music, how do you begin? The first step is to listen to as much music as possible, and try to not judge the music based on how it looks or how it sounds. Take time and listen to the music with an open mind, paying attention to the individual parts, and how they fit together to create the overall piece. Listen closely, pay attention to the rhythm, the beat and how it drives the music forward. Pay attention to the bass line, the melody, and the lyrics. If the music is in a foreign language, try to pay attention to the rhythm and tonal quality of the lyrics just as much as the words. The more you listen, the more you'",

    "instruction":"What type of soil is suitable for cactus?",
    "output_1":"Cactus plants require a well-drained, sandy soil with a neutral to slightly acidic pH level. A good soil mix for cactus plants contains equal parts of potting soil, coarse sand, and perlite or coarse gravel.",
    "generator":"text_davinci_003",
    "dataset":"helpful_base",
    "output_2":"What type of soil is suitable for cactus? As mentioned earlier, many cacti require well-drained soil that is light and rich in organic matter. You want to be sure that the soil does not retain too much moisture, as many cacti can rot in soggy soil. Most desert plants prefer sandy or gravelly soil with excellent drainage. You want to avoid soil that is too heavy or moist, as cacti can be damaged by water logging. Many cacti may survive in a variety of soils, but most prefer well-drained soil with low soluble salts. Cactus roots require soil that is free of excessive salts as they will try to extract the salts from the soil rather than store them in the plant which can lead to plant death. What should I fertilize my cactus with? Cactus generally require little or no fertilizer and may not take up any nutrients at all. However, if you are looking to stimulate healthy growth, a balanced fertilizer can increase yields of flowers and fruit, increase root development and reduce stress from environmental conditions. Use cactus fertilizer specific for this type of plant. You do not want to use any slow-release or long-lasting fertilizers, as the nutrients may be released within the root zone too slowly and, thus, potentially lead to toxicity to the cactus. Cactus nutrient requirements depend on the cactus species, location and soil conditions. Check the recommended crop nutrient level in the crop manual or your local agriculture department. Watering Schedule Cactus typically require less water than other types of plants. The timing of watering depends on the type of cactus you grow. Some types, such as Prickly Pear, do not require much water while others, such as Saguaro, have higher water requirements. A good general rule of thumb is to allow the soil to dry partially before watering again. Cacti tend to take up water slowly and require less water than other types of plants. You do not want to soak the soil as this can cause root rot. Always check to see if your cactus needs water before you water as over-watering can cause rot. Watering frequency also varies depending on the type of cactus you grow. Frequent watering may cause root rot in some species, while others, such as Prickly Pear, can withstand some dry spells as they do not have deep tap roots. Most cacti are not fussy about soil moisture for long periods of time and will recover quickly from stressful dry periods. Remember, to grow healthy cacti without diseases, it is important to apply the right method of watering and fertilizing. What are some natural pests that may attack cactus? Insects and pests are significant threats to cacti. They can cause serious damage to your cactus by feeding on their tender shoots and roots. Several insects and pests are natural predators for cacti, which means they should be kept at bay naturally. The following are some of the natural pests that may affect cactus: Spider mites are small insects that suck the sap of the leaves of cacti. They are difficult to control, and if left undetected, they can cause severe damage to your cactus. Mealybugs This is another type of insect that sucks on the sap of leaves and stems making the plant wilt and die in time. It is characterized by white cotton-like wax coating on the cactus stems. Ticks This is also a pest that lives on the cacti and sucks the sap from the foliage. The cactus becomes weak, and then dies. Root Weevil The beetle is small in size and causes severe damage to cactus by eating the roots system, leading to the dying of the cactus. Other natural pests Some other pests that may affect cactus are thrips, spiders and snails. How can I protect my cactus from pests? Insect and pest infestation leads to cactus damage. Hence, taking proactive measures is crucial to keeping these pests away from your cactus. Here are some steps to protect your cactus from pests: Avoid stress- Indoor cacti can be stressed from over-watering or improper climate control. Make sure to maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels for your cacti to keep them healthy and pest-free. Keep your cacti away from windowsills and other areas that can experience excessive heat and sun",

Sources: Eat Right, NHS https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/live-well\/eat-...\nFeb 22, 2020 - Food for pregnant women must meet the nutritional demands of a growing baby, while avoiding substances that may harm the developing child. Most healthy, well-nourished women undergoing normal pregnancies can meet their nutritional needs with a balanced diet, comprised of recommended allowances of a variety of foods. However, pregnant women need to supplement their diet with certain key nutrients, especially iron, folic acid, iodine, calcium, protein, and vitamin D. The following are some of the specific foods and drinks that are recommended for pregnant women: Leafy green vegetables: These are a good source of vitamin A, which is needed for the developing baby to see light, and folic acid, which helps prevent neural tube defects. Good examples of leafy greens are spinach, kale, collard greens, and romaine lettuce. Protein: Protein is essential for growth and development of the baby. So, it is recommended to include protein-rich foods like fish, eggs, lean meat, nuts, and beans in the meals. Orange fruits and vegetables: These are rich in vitamin C, which helps to lower the risk of neural tube defects and to increase iron absorption. Orange fruits and vegetables include citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits), bell peppers, carrots, and sweet potatoes. Dairy products: Milk and dairy products contain a type of calcium that is easily absorbed by the body. They are also good sources of vitamin D, which helps to keep bones strong. Calcium rich foods: Calcium is vital for bone development and maintenance. Foods like broccoli, dark leafy greens like spinach or kale, soy beans like edamame as well as almond or rice milk also provide good source of calcium. Good fats: Some key foods for pregnant women are almonds, avocado and olive oil, which are rich sources of monounsaturated fats that help lower the risk of complications that may arise in pregnancy. Water and juices: In addition to providing hydration, water and juices are good sources of various vitamins. Fruits juices that are high in vitamin C or citrus fruits can also increase iron absorption. Other beverages: Coffee, tea and alcohol should be avoided during pregnancy. Avoid raw foods: Some pregnant women have an increased risk of food-borne illnesses like listeria. Avoiding raw foods can help to prevent them from illness.

For women, shaving the area around the anus may be even more uncomfortable and can lead to a higher risk of infections, says Heffernan. They say that any time you get in a hot tub, you should take a shower at least 24 hours afterward.\nHow to Deodorize Your Armpits Naturally\nYour risk of developing the rare and serious form of skin cancer, says Heffernan. Using a regular, plain toothbrush also works well. He says the most important way to avoid the spread of germs is to wash your hands, especially when entering and leaving public places. Some people might worry that taking a shower after having sex could wash away sperm or risk accidental pregnancy. Others are more susceptible to bacterial colonization. While some of us may find it a bit weird, it is actually a completely safe and natural thing to do. The best way to prevent the spread of infections during sex is to use latex condoms. It is essential to be aware of the type of antiperspirant you are using as some may have adverse effects. But while it's not likely to be responsible for the virus' spread, there is one thing you can do to avoid it taking hold completely. In general, however, bacteria should be allowed to colonize the vagina in order for the vagina to maintain its normal, healthy state. The good news is that the virus is not contagious before signs and symptoms appear. And some have speculated that the chlorine in tap water is to blame. If you want to get rid of it that day, make sure you dry off afterwards. It is an accepted fact that it is difficult to kill bacteria. They can also provide excellent protection against STIs, including chlamydia and bacterial vaginosis. While there are certainly environmental factors that may contribute to the development of odors during sex, not all smells are directly controllable. You can use a mild soap and water, or a solution of hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol. However, this will remove the bacteria and reduce the smell while allowing healthy bacteria colonization to reclaim the area in your armpits. So if people are worried that their intimacy could lead to a sexually transmitted infection STI , they should worry about any intimate activity. These microbes have evolved to colonise the various surfaces of the body, including our gut walls, without becoming toxic to us. However, the bacteria colonise the vagina in the absence of harmful bacteria, and it is this balance that enables normal vaginal health. The vagina usually has a healthy balance of good and bad bacteria, such as Lactobacilli and Gardnerella vaginalis, that keep it infections. Using baking soda as an antiperspirant is an effective measure to address the problem of the stale odor. Some types of antiperspirant use a strong fragrance. This bacterial balance enables the vagina to maintain the normal, healthy state of the vaginal mucous membrane or vulva skin. They can also help keep the vagina at its best, preventing overgrowth of harmful bacteria and providing nutrients. It may also be that the skin around the armpits is more delicate, and we tend to sweat up the area more due to its lack of hair. You should try to do so at least twice a week for the best results. Others sweat more, which can cause a buildup of bacteria. As a general rule of thumb, it's best to keep your vagina healthy and balanced by allowing it to maintain the natural state of its bacteria culture. They say that if there is a build-up of bacteria, a hot shower could help break down the bacteria or the deodorant. But some of the more well-known products contain strong chemicals that can be irritating to the skin. It's also a good idea to wash your hands thoroughly in the bathroom, especially if they have been near your body. The idea that douching or bathing too much can also be linked to the smell is also a myth.\nVideo about how to prevent bacteria in vagina:\nHowever, the direction often provides for the least effective type of smell to prevent.

The character was a reporter who disguised himself as a mild-mannered journalist, Clark Kent.\nThe first issue of Superman was serialized as an eight-page comic strip in Action Comics # 1 in June 1938. The Superman comic strip was published and produced by DC Comics. However, the comics were created based on a character that was originally owned by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\nThe superman who made us so afraid of flying planes\nCause of an unexpected earthquake or volcanic eruption?\nWhat is a CAN bus?\nWhat did the Romans do with leftover food?\nWhy do we have different types of skin color?\nWho is the world\u2019s oldest living person?\nWho are the most famous women politicians in the world?\nWhat is the smallest and the largest country in the world?\nWho is the youngest female Prime Minister in the world?\nHow many countries are there in the world today?\nWho are the top 10 richest women in the world of 2019?\nWomen are more intelligent than Men: YES NO\nWomen are less violent than Men: YES NO\nWomen speak more languages than Men: YES NO",

    "output_2":"What is Atlantis? Is it a mythical, sunken continent swamped by a cataclysmic deluge, as ancient Greek poets tell us? Is it the lost city of the ancient Athenians, as recent researchers suggest? Is it the great civilizational complex of the ancient Egyptians, which Herman S. Wolters describes in his book, Atlantis: The Great Secret? Or is Atlantis a psychological metaphor for the unconscious mind, as in the work of Carl Jung, whose book, Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth, explores psychic imagery, cultural archetypes, and the collective dreams of humanity? In What is Atlantis?, H.P. Blavatsky, the founder of the modern Esoteric Philosophy, suggests that to truly understand the meaning of Atlantis, we must look beyond conventional wisdom, and turn to the inner reality revealed by true spiritual knowledge. She writes, \"The reader will have to satisfy himself with inferring the meaning which I attach to the symbol of Atlantis, from the teachings of the esoteric philosophy in general, and of the Secret Doctrine in particular. He will . . . have to seek a hidden meaning, a symbolic meaning, under the letter, or the name of this legendary continent.\" By exploring the meaning of this myth both inside and outside of the consciousness of humanity, Blavatsky suggests that the ancient legends of Atlantis point to a deeper, more profound truth about human nature and our collective consciousness. What is Atlantis? is both an illuminating and enlightening look at the meaning of an enduring myth, and a fascinating glimpse into the mysteries of the human mind.

    "output_2":"How do I make escargot? The easiest\/best way is to buy them frozen from the store. If you want to make them yourself, you can buy fresh snails and cut them in half. Add them to a saucepan with butter, garlic, and parsley. Cover the saucepan with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes. When you remove the foil, add a splash of wine, cover, and let the sauce boil down for a few minutes. Discard the parsley (unless you really like it!) and serve the liquid with the snails. Any additional sauce you want can be added separately. How do I make escargot sauce? There are many recipes for escargot sauce out there, but here is our favorite recipe\u2026 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 1\/2 cups white wine 1\/4 cup dry white wine 2 tablespoons butter 1\/2 teaspoon salt 1\/2 teaspoon pepper 2 1\/2 cups heavy cream Whisk together the garlic, wine, butter, salt, and pepper in a small saucepan. Add 2 cups of the heavy cream to the mixture and whisk until combined. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium-low heat, whisking frequently. Reduce heat to low and whisk in remaining heavy cream, while constantly whisking. Once the cream and wine mixture is thick, remove the sauce from heat and cover with foil to keep warm. How do I eat escargot? To eat escargot, you remove the tail and any remaining shell with a knife (but we do not recommend it \u2013 just use a toothpick), and pop the meat into your mouth with a spoon or fork. Make sure to suck on the shell to remove any remaining garlic and butter\u2026and you can eat as many as you can handle! What\u2019s the easiest way to open an escargot shell? The easiest way to open an escargot shell is to make a small incision on the side of the shell with a sharp knife before you place the food in. Once you remove the meat, the incision stays open allowing you to remove the tail and any remaining shell. Did You Know? Escargots were once served as a delicacy to the Roman Empire. In the 4th century, when the Empire was in decline, they were still being enjoyed even though they were considered to have a bitter taste! Why do people eat escargot? Escargot has a unique taste that many cultures find interesting \u2013 both for the creamy texture of the meat and for the aroma of the garlic and butter. They can be prepared many different ways, but the most popular way to eat escargots is to place the meat inside the shell and place them in a garlic and butter sauce for a savory experience. What is the best way to store escargot? Since escargot are living animals, they should not be left out of the refrigerator for more than a day. If you want to store them in the refrigerator, wrap them in foil, then wrap them in plastic and refrigerate them. However, if you want to store them outside the refrigerator, you can do so on a flat plate, but be careful not to let them dry out, as this can cause them to become hard. Do escargot make good pets? Escargot, on the other hand, do not make good pets and should not be kept as domestic animals as such pets pose significant risks to humans. Snails produce a toxic substance called conotoxins, which are used in many research laboratories for their therapeutic value and are also used in some studies of the effects of drugs on the central nervous system. If they become sick or injured, they might release the toxin. However, most people do not consider them as pets because they are messy, they eat everything that is in their surroundings, and they can be quite noisy! Are there any health benefits from eating escargot? There are no significant health benefits associated with eating escargot. They have low nutritional value, and most of their components (such as protein, fat, and carbohydrate) consist of water, chitin (which is a hard, structural component of their shells), and calcium. Some people believe that escargot has medicinal properties due to its high content of conotoxins, but no significant research has been done in this field as of yet. Noneth",

Make tahini sauce by pureeing tahini with lemon juice.\nThen add some salt, garlic powder, cumin and paprika to taste.\nAdd enough water to help thin it out. To assemble the fritters, place the pumpkin on a cutting board, using a sharp knife, cut into cubes about 1 to 1.5 cm in size. Put the flour, breadcrumbs and spices in separate bowls. Dip the chopped pumpkin into the flour, then into the breadcrumbs and shake off any excess.\nHeat the oil in a large saucepan to medium heat. Fry the fritters until golden brown on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve hot with tahini sauce if desired. What are some good dips for pita bread bites? These are just some suggestions, use your imagination and add some other favorites to the list. Hi Tanya, here are some ideas for great dips for pita bite sandwiches: Hummus.\nPumpkin Hummus. Roasted Red Pepper Hummus. Baba Ganoush. Feta Cheese. Avocado Cilantro. This is similar to a falafel sandwich but with a Mediterranean flair, featuring crispy fried kibbeh and fresh herbs. Kibbeh kibbeh is a Middle Eastern dish made with ground lamb and bulgur, a form of cous cous, and rolled into small balls.\nThen the balls are fried into crispy nuggets. In this recipe, the crispy fried kibbeh balls are served with fresh herbs such as parsley, cilantro and mint, as well as a tahini sauce or red tahini sauce for dipping. This recipe can easily be made vegan or gluten-free by simply substituting ground turkey or chicken for the lamb. In a large bowl, mix the ground lamb, bulgur wheat, onion, parsley, cilantro, garlic and salt to form a paste.\nDivide the mixture into 12 balls, about 1 to 1. Knead the balls to make a tight texture and flatten them slightly with the palm of your hand. Heat the oil in a large skillet over med-high heat. When hot, add the kibbeh and cook for about 5 minutes or until they turn golden brown. Turn the kibbeh occasionally to get an even brown crust, frying for one or two more minutes until they are crispy and golden.\nAchieving this requires a little work in the beginning. First, peel and remove the pit from a ripe pumpkin. Then cut out a section from the top and scoop out the flesh. Discard the top and bottom of the pumpkin, and roughly chop the pumpkin flesh.\nSet aside the chunks of cooked pumpkin for future use. Put the chunks into a food processor or blender, and puree until as smooth as possible, stopping and stirring occasionally to break up any large chunks.\nThe pureed pumpkin should be almost as liquid-like as pancake batter. Transfer the pumpkin puree into a bowl and mix into a sturdy, non-stick pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\nHeat the oil over medium-high heat until hot \u2014 it should only be able to sputter, not smoke. Spoon one 1 1\/4 cup- sized dollop of the pumpkin batter into the pan, forming a patty shape on the griddle. I have some falafel, but no tahini to put on them. Can you give me a recipe for making tahini? I am assuming you have sesame seeds?\nThen add some salt, garlic powder, cumin and paprika to taste. Add enough water to help thin it out. To assemble the fritters, place the pumpkin on a cutting board, using a sharp knife, cut into cubes about 1 to 1.\nPut the flour, breadcrumbs and spices in separate bowls.

Do you have any tips on how to hire a nanny?\nDo You Still Need a Babysitter After Hiring a Nanny?\nQ: Do I need a babysitter after I hire a nanny? Should I have one for the kids' well-being?\nA: Congrats on hiring a nanny! Once you've found your perfect match, you probably wonder, do I still need a babysitter? Here are some things to consider:\nWhy would you need a babysitter? The reason you need a babysitter in the first place may have been:\nYou need a sitter when the kids or the family need to go out to dinner or a playdate for a few hours or for the night.\nSomeone in the family requires childcare, but the nanny still needs a break from the kids during the day or for a special occasion.\nThe nanny needs to be away from the house for an extended period (such as days off or for training).\nSome families find it useful to have both a nanny and a babysitter because a nanny is trained specifically to care for children, and a babysitter often can provide last-minute childcare (if you need it), but doesn\u2019t have the same level of training.\nThink about the logistics of hiring a babysitter. You may find that it is more expensive to hire a babysitter than it is to bring in a nanny. After all, you are paying a babysitter for the same work your nanny is already doing on a regular basis. However, it may make sense to have both a nanny and a babysitter at times, especially if:\nYou want a babysitter for your child\u2019s well-being, such as for an overnight stay or during extended sick time.\nYou want a sitter for one-time events or holiday parties.\nYou want an extra set of experienced hands to handle difficult, but occasionally needed, childcare duties (such as transporting children to and from activities, or coordinating carpools).\nOnce you\u2019ve hired a nanny, you should make any adjustments they might require for their job. The nanny should be given a list of family rules and expectations, such as bedtime procedures, feeding schedules, and what to do in case of an emergency.\nYou should also give the nanny space if need be. It may be appropriate for the nanny to decline to babysit for your family when they know the parents will be nearby. After all, they are ultimately responsible for your children while they are in their care and it should be clear who is in charge.\nFinally, it\u2019s important to consider the cost of hiring a babysitter. If you have a set budget for childcare, it\u2019s helpful to talk to both the nanny and the babysitter to see if they are open to alternative arrangements. You may be able to split the cost of both to help your family stay within budget. Ultimately, the choice of whether or not to use a babysitter after securing a nanny is up to you and your family\u2019s needs, preferences, and budget. Good luck!\nIf you have other questions or concerns, please email us at support@care.com. You can also reach out to your local Care.com office for support.\nbabysitter question and answer",

My question is: How can I use my phone less? Any tips?\nEveryone, we're going to start with Jesse.\nWell, Jesse, maybe the first step is to admit it.\nI think everybody has the problem of being more attached to their phone, and that\u2019s a big problem because it\u2019s not just about being attached to your phone, it\u2019s about not being present in the moment, it\u2019s about not being focused on the people we are with, or the things we\u2019re actually doing.\nAnd so I guess the first step is to be aware of the extent to which we\u2019re addicted to our phone, or use our phone excessively. So, perhaps an important starting point is to start really examining how often you check your phone, how much time you spend on your phone, how often you use your phone, and really look at how disruptive it is to your life.\nI would also encourage people to think about why they\u2019re using their phone a lot, and what they\u2019re getting out of it. Are they checking Facebook because they feel socially isolated and want to connect with people, or is it really just because it\u2019s a way to be entertained or to pass time?\nAnd so identifying those reasons and maybe thinking about how you could be meeting those needs without the phone might be helpful, or even maybe reducing your time on social media, or really trying to minimize your phone use overall, especially during meal times or other activities that are important for you to be present in.\nI think it\u2019s also very important to remember that phones are just tools, and that the way we choose to use them is very much our choice, and can have a big impact on our lives. So I think a good starting point is just becoming more aware and more conscientious about the way we\u2019re using our phone, and to try to make changes to the extent that we can.\nWell said. Now, let's move on to our next participant, Mel.\nMel, are there any apps or tools that may help the participant to use their phone less or manage phone usage better?\nYes, absolutely. So when it comes to managing phone usage or reducing screen time, there\u2019s actually a lot of apps and tools out there that can be very helpful.\nOne thing that you can try is reducing the amount of time that you give yourself to respond to your phone. So for example, if you\u2019re checking your phone a lot at night, you might try setting a schedule where you only check it at certain defined times of the day, like in the morning and in the evening, and try to avoid checking it at other times throughout the day.\nAnd one way to do that is through apps like Moment, which is an app that tracks the amount of time that you spend on your phone, and helps you set a schedule for when you\u2019re allowed to use it. It can also track how often you\u2019re picking up and putting your phone down, or how often your phone vibrates, which can help you become more aware of your phone usage in general.\nSpeaking of becoming more aware, there\u2019s also an app called Cold Turkey, which is an app that lets you configure specific times in the day when you can use your phone, and if you go off schedule, you\u2019re locked out of using your phone completely, so you can use it as an accountability tool.\nAnd then there\u2019s also an app called Forest, which is an app that uses real-time nature sounds to keep you invested in your task or goal until it's finally complete, and so if your phone usage is keeping you away from your life or tasks, Forest could be a useful tool to use to help keep you engaged.\nAnd then, finally, there's an app called Freedom, which is another app that can help you limit the amount of time that you spend on certain websites or applications, so if you have a tendency to check Instagram or other social media sites several times a day, Freedom could be a useful app to use to help limit the amount of time that you spend on those apps.\nThose are just few examples. And they\u2019re all available in the app store, so you can definitely try them out and see what works best for you.\nGreat. So, now let's turn to our final participant of the day, Eloise.\nThank you, Mel, for those great suggestions. Perhaps the participant could also consider taking a screen time break, and using time to do something different from their phone. What are",

    "output_1":"Humans evolved the belief in a higher power or God for a variety of reasons. This belief may have provided comfort and hope in difficult times, motivated people to act ethically, and provided a sense of purpose and order in the universe.

    "output_2":"Why did humans evolve to believe in God? Why do many humans still believe in God? Why did human religious belief systems evolve to the shape they are in now? Why do religious people feel so strongly about the things they believe in? And what's going to happen to religion and other areas of human spirituality when we start to become truly conscious as a species, and also when we develop technologies that provide us with alternative ways of experiencing and understanding reality?\nThe more you think about it, the more complex and thorny these questions become, and it's easy to see why many people get bogged down in their beliefs and the arguments they have with others over those beliefs. It's not so easy to know where to go for answers, and even when you do think you have an answer, many others may disagree with you.\nOne thing is certain, though: This is a crucial area to keep our eyes on, because human religious beliefs and practices are not going away anytime soon, and in fact are likely to become more and more prominent and controversial with each passing year as the planet's population and globalization continue to increase. We'd better start working out our own theories about these important questions and issues now, because they're only going to become more complex as time goes on.\nThe Cosmic Evolutionary Questions Project is devoted to seeking answers to these questions and many others related to human spirituality, consciousness, and the future of the planet and our way of life. We'll be looking for the best experts and practitioners in these areas, and compiling and publishing insights, ideas, and discoveries from them in book form, in online articles, and in any other ways we can think of.\nThis is an exciting but also challenging project, both intellectually and practically. If you think you can contribute in some way to helping us learn more about these important questions and issues, even if only by offering a different perspective, please let us know. We're always listening and looking for ways to refine and improve our approach.\nWe hope to make an impact in our effort to help all of humanity understand and navigate these crucial, complex issues more effectively, and we're looking forward to meeting and working with anyone \u2014 from any where in the world \u2014 who wants to contribute to this endeavor.\nWhat is the purpose of human life? What is our purpose as a species? When I started asking myself these questions, I had to face something many of us have probably experienced ourselves \u2014 the nagging feeling that I wasn't satisfied with my own answer, that I needed something more. Could there be more to life than eating, sleeping, and working until you die? But is there more than just that, or is that all there is? In other words, what was the point of life?\nI have been obsessed with finding answers to questions like these since I was a young child and began exploring my sense of consciousness, existence, and the nature of reality. Even as a small child, I had a nagging sense that there was more to this world than what I could perceive with the five senses that we're most familiar with. I remember being fascinated with things like the work of Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, which seemed to delve into the deepest questions of existence.\nI had some pretty outlandish ideas at the time about what these questions meant. For instance, when I was about 5 or 6 years old, I thought that when somebody died, their body decomposed into the elements that made it up, and then these elements were carried by raindrops into the roots of trees and other plants, which then formed a kind of tree or flower from the body.\nThat was quite a strange idea. But it's an example of how you can't fully comprehend what you're thinking about until later on, especially when it comes to big questions like this. In time, I realized that the true answer to these questions is quite complex, and it involves deep philosophical and metaphysical considerations, as well as practical and personal exploration into one's consciousness, conscious existence, values, and worldview.\nThese questions are not just about abstract philosophical speculation or esoteric intellectual pursuits. They are deeply personal questions that have to do with who we are, why we're here, where we're going, and the ultimate meaning of it all. These questions aren't just about the metaphysical or spiritual aspects of life \u2014 they are also about our day-to-day existence, our relationships, and the meaningful contribution we can make to the world.\nAs I got older and explored deeper and wider, I found that my curiosity about these \"ultimate\" questions \u2014 and the search for answers to",
