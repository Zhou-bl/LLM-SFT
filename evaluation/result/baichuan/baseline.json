        "instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?",
        "output": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?\nA: It's an excellent question, one I wish I was asked more often. Most of life is a series of games, and kicking a ball around is certainly one of them. The way the game works is simple and straightforward: There are nine people on each team (six girls and three boys) and everyone starts with equal-sized equipment: a small ball, a leather kicker to hit the ball with and a long plastic stick to swing about.\nGame rules begin with a person at each end of a 21-foot long imaginary line. The kickballers, divided into two teams of five, line up on each side of the line. A referee stands over the line, and the person at each end is the goal keeper.\nAt this point, both teams are allowed to yell things like, \"Hit it!\" or \"Make those knees go!\"\nWhen the referee blows a whistle, the kickballers take turns swinging their sticks and hitting the kickball with the leather end and pushing it down the field. When someone on either team hits the kickball into the net of their goal keeper, he places the kickball down and counts it.\nIf the game is about to end, he counts his own team's kickballs in. If it's not, he continues to count the kickballs into the goal of the other team.\nThe team with the most kickballs in the net when the game is finished wins.\nNow, here's the kicker: The kickballers who make their way around the field without kicking a ball are called \"hooks\" or, if they succeed in kicking the ball behind the goal line, \"hoosiers\"\nHooks are usually people who can't kick and are assigned the job, and hoosiers usually refer to older players who think they are better than the youngsters but still can't kick the football.\nWhen a horseshoe or a hoosier comes to you, you can refuse to accept the work of doing a turn in the field -- and that's what your sister's girlfriends will insist on and probably expect you to do.\nSo let's be realistic: If you don't like the game of kickball, don't play.\nIf you don't want to lose or get hurt, quit early, and don't be a horseshoe or a hoosier. If you want to have fun and have your sister and friends understand why you don't try to be a horseshoe but still want to be a kickballer, tell them these four things:\nI don't like the rules against horseshoes and I wish the game didn't have them.\nMy sister won't let me be a hoosier (she says I'm too short).\nWhen I go out for the next girls' game, they're going to put me in when I'm not tired yet, even in a game that's going to end right away.\nI'm a lot more fun for everybody on the other team when I'm out and about kicking the ball than when I'm sitting around kicking it behind the net.\nMy sister and her girlfriends should have no problem letting me play when I do what I think is right. And if it still comes to me being hoosied out at the last minute, I can accept that.\nWhat can I do to make everyone happy when my family is fighting?\nFights in families are the worst. They can be destructive to the health and well-being of all who are involved, and they are a sign that something's wrong.\nThe best way to stop them and to help every family member, or at least help you, is to make a request. If you had a bad fight with one of your brothers or sisters today, tonight or yesterday, call him or her directly and ask him or her to talk about it. Do not discuss it with your parents first: That will confuse matters and take away responsibility from those who are really responsible, even if that includes your parents.\nGet your sibling alone, and say that you want a conversation with him or her. If you don't know how to get alone with the person, ask for specific help that will be to everyone's advantage:\n\"I'd like to talk about the things that we weren't able to talk about with Mom and Dad this summer. I'd like to say something and you to say something back. Would you help me to get that done?\"\nBe direct, be honest and don't hold back any of it. Tell this person the things that bothered you, even if they will get him or"

It makes it sound like you never actually thought about your girlfriend or boyfriend that day and never bought them a gift for a special occasion, so you couldn’t go out and get them something they liked now.\nAnd to be honest if the other person didn’t gift wrap their gifts, there’s no one to take responsibility for the gift being wrapped and no one to make sure it doesn’t get damaged.\n“When you give an item that cost more than £50, it’s worth spending time wrapping it.\nIf you pay less than £50, wrapping it could be a little tricky unless you have a professional job.\nFor more than £50 you don’t really have a case of not wrapping it well; it’s not a case where you’re going to leave a gift on the doorstep and say “here you go, sorry I couldn’t wrap it better”.\nIs it acceptable to give someone a gift that you bought someone else?\nIf you gave it to someone you trust and they wanted it, then it’s fine.\nIf you gave it to someone you loved then it’"

        "output": "How do I dice without slicing my finger or cutting myself?\"\n\nIt went to the top of the list in terms of questions but I don't think it came up often. I think people figured they could buy a good knife, but that wasn't in the first hour. I think the first couple of hours you're just figuring out what you can use for the first few hours, because you get home at night and think, \"What am I going to do next week?\"\n\n**J:** And it's so hard to get enough product for the market to really change it.\n\n**D:** Right. We're always looking for the next opportunity and the next opportunity is to make people feel more comfortable. People want to learn.\n\n**J:** What was the first thing you did to get your foot in?\n\n**D:** I started off with a local restaurant in the first city I came to. There was a small restaurant, an old Jewish deli. I knew the guy, so it looked like I was a personal friend going to visit him. I said, \"I have a product. I want to see if it's something you want.\" He told me he used to use a Japanese-Mexican knife, because he liked all those handles with wood on them. And he said, \"You know, I try to use a good cutlery, but I don't really know how this stuff works.\" I took out the 11-incher [a Japanese-meat cleaver] and I showed him very clearly exactly how to use it.\n\nYou just start with something very simple, you have to. You have to learn a lot yourself first. You can't be a salesman with a dumb knife in his hand. There are people that have come to us and want to start their own company and they haven't even learned how to work with their knives. I don't want to have to answer to people like that. You need to have the knowledge to do it.\n\nYou can't be just the sales guy. You have to be the sales and production guy. You have to wear all those hats. We're all very much hands-on and we're very much involved in everything. We can't let anybody do it if we have to go in the next room and close the door. We have to be able to oversee it.\n\nI can't say, \"You go there, that's for you.\"\n\n**J:** What kind of knives do you think are best? What's your favorite? What's the one you keep coming back to that you think is awesome?\n\n**D:** I've never seen a better steak knife than the one from J. A. Henckels.\n\n**J:** They are amazing. I have some. The feel, the quality... I know you're not supposed to be attached to certain things like this, but they're just great, aren't they?\n\n**D:** They're great. The handle. You know, it's a thin, polished handle. You can tell it's not a blade that's held together. It just feels very good there. And the edge on there is beautiful and it's real sharp.\n\nBut I got to say that I was very disappointed. There's one knife, the G-100 in Germany, it has great handles, it's beautiful. But for some reason it's got a handle that you have to turn around for like 360 degrees. To get that kind of handle and all those little cuts and the beauty of it really defeats the purpose of having a handle.\n\nYou know how you put your hand on a door handle, just your palm, your thumb on the back? That's what the handle of the G-100 feels like. Your hand is like a circle. The back of the knife is like a blade, and then the edge is at three o'clock. And your back of your hand can go from 3 to 11 and get on to every part of the handle. It's just great. But the knife itself just isn't sharp enough.\n\nI also really like the Western, what they call a \"Saskatchewan\" in the movie. It's a little thinner than a normal kitchen knife but a little bigger. To me, it's got a real beefy, solid feel.\n\n**J:** What did it feel like as you were using it? I've never seen a video of you working with the J. A. Henckels. What was it like?\n\n**D:** I was in the deli for about an hour. I showed him every detail"

Today's example:\nThis is a song title, you know, and it's a happy song I love. It's been covered quite a few times and sung by many great artists. But the one I hear (listen to?) the most often is by the Beatles. Of course!\nYou probably know this one already, but I want to post it here because it's a good reminder of one of the greatest things about our time here on this Earth: music.\nLabels: Happiness Is\nIt's The Thought That Counts (Except For This)\n[Update at the bottom of the post. It involves the Beatles and politics.]\nThis kind of thing gets posted around the web quite a bit these days (this is one of several on this topic posted today) but I happened to find two sources on the topic and couldn't resist sharing them.\nFirst off, I love this 26-Year Old Girl's Perspective from the article from Bustle (as an aside, the article makes a reference to \"thumbing through a magazine\" which strikes as a bit strange to me; the \"thumbing\" is done on her smartphone, don'tcha know?).\nThen after I shared the article on Facebook and a friend shared it, he included this: \"The author could be referring to the entire Republican Party.\"\nA lot of the posts online (and some of the comments as well) are about political differences; you know: the left and the right, liberals and conservatives. It's all just semantics, and the authors of these kinds of posts seem to be taking them quite seriously. Some even comment on their Facebook pages and even post things about their friends on Facebook. If that's not a sure indicator that you live in a polarized world, I'm not sure what is. All around me there is so much division.\nAnd it's not just around here in the Western World. I watched a few minutes of a video made by a Russian comedian (really not the first time he's done this; he did this kind of video back in 2012 and it ended up with a huge number of views [note: the video is in Russian]). While not the most professional of video productions, the comedian does a really great job at poking fun at the current political situation. In this latest video, he talks about how no one likes the other party. You've probably heard many Americans talk about how they can't stand the other party; I've heard it in many conversations around here. And this is the Russian comedian talking about that. His conclusion? Our political parties are really not that different. When the two parties take the time to talk, it's all smiles.\nOh, but let the rhetoric and the negativity continue and then we've got the opposite of what this guy is saying. He can't believe we're not united (or something to that effect).\nSo let's end it all by saying it's the thought that counts.\nUnless you happen to be a Red Sox fan.\nIn Which I Write About My Health for No Reason at All\nMy health's been in a fair bit of turmoil the last few decades, and the most interesting thing for me occurred last month, when there was a sudden sharp downturn. I was scheduled to get an MRI on Tuesday, January 20, but I got sick and was out from Monday until Wednesday. For some reason"

We can supply you with some of our own designs or provide you a template so you can make it yourself with materials you already have at home.\nThese are some of our more common items but we can build any type of gear you would need.\nYou might be asking yourself: “Why should I use them instead of off the rack? Why are they better than other brands?” Because we use our own high-quality, heat-treated, galvanized and painted steel to build each piece.\nThe steel we use is American made and has the exact dimensions and specs we need to build top quality workwear. The galvanizing and paint are not just for looks because in the long run the paint protects the raw steel and allows it to withstand the elements so you can be sure it lasts well, and the paint itself doesn’t fade. That’s why we also take the time to apply a high-quality protective coat to the steel after we build the item.\nAll too often you will find other companies will cut costs and use inferior materials to try to appeal to the masses. For a price you can get almost any piece of workwear, but we can build it our way so you get top quality and will be a very long time before it needs to be replaced.\nWe’ll even give the final piece to you with a couple coats of protective paint so you can leave it outside or submerse it in a pool until you want to use it and you won’t have to worry about the paint fuzzy or getting worn off.\nOur quality items don’t cost much more than the common ones. If you’d rather build it yourself, we can do that too. We just need to make you a small custom CAD file to make the plans.\nSome work wear requires a good fit to provide the right amount of support and comfort. We can customize our build to meet your specifications, or we can give you a CAD file to make your own.\nDo you have something in stock that I can get shipped today?\nWe might, but it depends on what you want. It could be anywhere from a work apron to an entire welding shop. If you are looking for a custom piece that’s not seen previously then the answer is probably NO.\nWhat does custom building mean?\nA lot. When we are asked if we build custom workwear we typically look at a customer’s needs, size, comfort, cost, and weight for instance.\nIf you see something that is not in production that you need, you can give us a call and we can talk and decide whether we want to modify the product and then build it based on your needs and specifications.\nWe can also build customized shop storage to meet your needs and your budget, though in some cases we might recommend a few modifications to the usual configuration.\nWe will also make custom tool boxes for almost anything. These can be small or large, made from steel or wood, and can be made to fit in almost any space you have in mind. We can also make them for you without you needing to purchase the pieces or to draw them up or make a template out of your own wood.\nIf you do not quite know what is needed for your shop, we can talk through it with you. If we need more information, we can make a CAD file and we can talk that over and you can make your own.\nDo you have plans or a template to sell?\nNo, we do not. We do have CAD plans for individual pieces of industrial equipment, such as ladders, but not for custom builds.\nWe just make the items one at a time as they are needed, as you might already know.\nWe can make a small custom CAD file to make the plans.\nWe also don’t sell templates.

I used all the products combined in one layer, in a matte foundation.\nI also found a foundation which is called Tarte Luminesce which I absolutely love to use. When I don't have time for a full make-up I use it as a base product. I have never made any posts on this blog about it because it only comes in the US, but I found it available online and for those who can't get it in the US I can let you know that it has the best coverage I've seen so far.\nHello, I am also going to order CeraVe.

        "output": "Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving? This is an interesting fact, as the official food of Thanksgiving is not turkey!\nIn 1969, a group of New York City women decided to end all the tradition and cook up Thanksgiving in an interesting way that would surprise everybody. They decided to combine seven types of food, so people who are on a special diet could eat too. Among other food, they baked stuffing with cranberry sauce.\nAfter that, the recipe became mainstream and that is the official food of Thanksgiving. But it has changed throughout the history of Thanksgiving. According to historians, the earliest Thanksgiving menu had turkey, roast beef, roast fowl of other types, turkey, venison, wild geese, chicken, ducklings, swans wings and plump game birds.\nAfter some time, that changed and Thanksgiving gained breads, pies, vegetables, squash and cranberries. And this is what we normally consider the famous food of Thanksgiving. But, the truth is that turkeys were the second ingredient after fish for hundreds of years, as they were very rare at the Old West and were considered to be luxury goods.\nThe First Thanksgivings\nThere is an interesting story about how Thanksgiving became a tradition as we know it today. According to history, the first thanksgiving took place way before 1621 when the Pilgrims went to celebrate the harvest of the Native Americans.\nHowever, there is a question about who was the first person to hold on a Thanksgiving with the whole family as a tradition. Usually, it is believed to be Sarah Hale, an activist writer who started writing about the need for giving thanks to God with family members every year.\nThanksgiving Traditions\nEven though there are many traditions surrounding Thanksgiving, the fact remains that it is a holiday where food is the main concern. There is the tradition of eating everything in one day, starting with turkey. Then comes stuffing and mashed potatoes. However, there are many things that people can do on Thanksgiving.\nThey can go to a church to sing sacred songs and listen to the sermon. Or they can spend quality time with their family and friends. After that, they spend the night with the TV and relax. In the end, they go out to shop and do all kinds of shopping.\nWhy Do We Celebrate Christmas & New Year?\nThe Origin Of Halloween\nWhat Is New Year’s Eve?\n5 Different Types of Food You Can Find in an Oyster\nWhy Do People Celebrate the 4th of July?\nWhat are the 5 Main Flavours of Coffee?\nWhat is Christmas and Why Is It Celebrated?\nWhy is Christmas So Special?\nWhat Is The Difference Between Christmas and New Year?\nWhich Country Has The Largest Population In The World?\nHow many days is Christmas Day?\nWhat is the Origin Of Christmas?

        "output": "I want to get better at networking at work,” for example, would be an example of a personal development goal.\nBut what about other ideas?\n“I want to get better at writing my own blog posts,” for example, might be a work related goal. Perhaps you want to learn how to start your own company from home, and perhaps you’ll only be able to do it when you no longer need to be in an office every day – so it’s not going to happen until you’re ready to retire.\nWhile there’s nothing wrong with these types of goals, they’re not the best ones. They have a couple of problems:\nWhat’s holding you back?\nHow are you going to stop yourself from taking the time to work on that goal (because it’s often not as important as you think)?\nWhat would you have to give up to make this a bigger priority? Perhaps your family? Your friends and social life? A career?\nWhat could you have done yesterday instead, that would be a lot more productive?\nYou wouldn’t go for a run when you’re 10 minutes into a family gathering or on your way out of work for the day. So why should this “work” goal be any different?\nWhat could you have done instead that would have made things simpler and you’d have been happier?\nWhat could you do today instead of working on your goals?\nWhat would take up your time and have you work on something else today?\nWhat could you do today, that could create a habit for yourself over time?\nWhich of your goals take up the most time?\nWhich of your goals take up the most time and are you the least happy to work on them?\nWhat’s the last thing you did, the last time you worked on this goal?\nHow did things turn out?\nWhat could you do better than you did last time?\nWhat habits did you want to create?\nHow are those habits doing now? Is it working?\nWhat habits have you been trying to change lately?\nHow’s that going?\nHow do you compare with others?\nHow is the average person doing in this area compared to you?\nIs that true?\nIf there’s something in here where you find you’re struggling, there will be an area of your brain that isn’t firing and you might need to make some adjustments.\nAs you can see, a lot of these questions are about the present and future aspects of your life. But there’s another category of questions, which are about your experience or your history as well.\n“How do you feel when you think about this goal?”\n“What would you say to your friend, if they asked you about this?”\n“Did you come up with all of the same ideas as the last time you worked on this goal?”\nThese are all about getting deeper in to the experience that you’re having, and being able to make adjustments on a deeper level. Your experience of this goal is something that can be changed quickly, and it’s in these areas that you might want to make some adjustments.\nSo, if it’s something that can be changed quickly, then you’re looking at an issue with your motivation for a goal. If it can’t be changed quickly, you might be looking at an issue with your emotional state to one of your goals.\nWhy Can’t I Do This?\nWhile there are certainly different psychological factors and types of motivation that could be at play, there are plenty of examples that it’s simply a lack of motivation.\nI’ve seen this a lot in my writing: I want to publish something, but I don’t want to put it into words.\nOn some level, we need to get it out of our minds and get it in to the world. But if you feel like you’re having a hard time writing or publishing something, you can try some of these questions for yourself:\nHow do you feel when you have to work on this goal?\nIf you need to, sit and think about it for a few minutes. Take a few deep breaths and let your mind wander. How do you feel when you think about this goal that you don’t want to work on?\nHow do you feel when you watch other people do it?\nYou might find it easier to write something yourself, but if your goal isn’t something you’re passionate about, you might find you need to watch others working on it first.\nHow do you feel when you think about finishing it?\nWhen you think about finishing up that goal, how are you feeling about it? Do you want to be done? Are you looking forward to it? Maybe you even find it exciting?\nAre there other things that could hold you accountable to working on this goal, or are you the only one doing this?\n"

There are quite a few and I love the fact that not one of them seems to offend anyone.\nWe have Christmas lights up from my Christmas Eve until Feb 2nd, just before Valentine's Day, since people who aren't religious, or have chosen to celebrate any other festival, seem to love us on Valentine's Day and we want to be nice to them and not be grumpy! We play Christmas music (if it's not too loud, or too early!) We put up the tree, and then, a few days later, put up decorations, including angels and figurines.\nWe do not leave the lights up until the 28th!\nI'm not big on cookies or breads or cakes. I'll bake a Christmas pudding in November, if I'm not too busy. There isn't a thing you can throw at me that I won't try, but no one else has the same love of Christmas the way I do.\nThe men love chocolate, and I mean real dark chocolate, not the milk chocolate you usually find. Chocolate-covered ginger, which is really good, dark chocolate covered strawberries... they have to try everything, in fact, it's quite a treat that I even make them do that.\nWe have people over for a Christmas lunch with a lot of food. No one brings anything much, and we have turkey, ham, chicken, roast beef, all sorts of vegetables, potato gratin, and apple crisp or pudding. I've added the pudding to my Christmas routine this year, because my Mom used to do it, but now she's too frail and it's a lot of work and someone else could do it, but no one ever has. I'll let you know how it goes.\nNo. There is no reason there should be. The man I'm with, knows I'm religious, and we have had discussions about many things, and other stuff, but he doesn't know that I really believe, although he knew I did before I met him. So, the idea that I put on airs just to make him believe I believe the same way that he does, is ridiculous."

        "output": "Hi, I'm interested in learning to play badminton. Can you explain the game to me?\nSure, let me give you a brief introduction. Badminton is a sport played with two people on each team. Each team hits the shuttlecock (a tiny hard ball with a net inside) back and forth across a net. The object of the game is for your team to get the shuttlecock over the net, over the opponents legs, and into one of the other sides hoops. You can try to hit it high and over the net or you can try to hit it low and under the net. To start the game, the first team throws the shuttlecock to the other team and the rest of the game is a battle for control to keep the shuttlecock in play. Hitting the shuttlecock out of the court results in a point for your opponents. When either team has 21 points its a game. So if you don't let the shuttlecock get to 21 points its a win for you. It's a lot more involved than the description may make it sound but it's really fun to play!"

        "output": "Do you know why cats always rub up against your legs? You may think that just like any other cat, it's because they just can't help being flirty, but it's because they're trying to get rid of fleas and other parasites.....that's why.\nHave you ever tried to pick up a pet, but it has been so busy playing, that it just continues to avoid being caught in your arms?\nWhy does your cat sit on your pillow during the night? You'll often find them on the pillow, but it has nothing to do with wanting to be cuddled, because the moment you attempt to comfort your cat, they'll be on the next chair or couch. Nope, your cat is there to smell your pillow and make sure you haven't changed your scent....or in some cases, it's to protect your pillow, because your pet has a fear of falling asleep on something that may be a threat.\nEven more amusing is that the cat may actually get more aggressive toward you, if you come within close proximity. Why? Because they can sense any change in your breathing from a good three feet away, or whenever you're feeling like you want to pet this cat. You'll find it hard to get this cat to cuddle up with you since your cat can't help but know that it has a lot to protect, and it isn't going to lose its independence....but that doesn't mean you're going to have a relationship without it needing the ultimate pet owner's hug.\nIn conclusion, your cat needs a hug because it would love to have a relationship with its owner, but there just can't be any intimacy. Your love for your cat must remain un-touchable even in a hug. A hug should simply symbolize love and respect for your cat, no more. Because you won't really know until you pucker your lips, you could have a cat that won't even peck you on the lips in a love kiss.\nYour cat needs a hug! Because it's a cat after all?\nA cat wants to curl up with you. A cat wants to be petted. A cat wants to be fed. A cat wants a comfy bed. A cat wants a litter box.\nBut a cat doesn't want to be hugged!!! Why? Because cats are animals and it just doesn't make sense to a cat to be cuddled up to humans. A cat wants to keep its independence even if its owner is close by! So why hug? Why cuddle? Why be intimate with a cat?\nCats cannot get comfortable, nor can they get any type of intimacy with some humans. I've been with my cat for over 25 years, but still can't get her to give me a full head and neck hug. This cat is not only my best friend, but a part of my family. I try in vain to put my head next to hers and ask her for a hug, and she won't do it. She might move away, but never allow me to cuddle and she will not move her head into my neck area, which is where I need her to move. This cat is very stubborn and likes its independence......and I can never really hug my cat in a good manner anyway!\nAs for pets, it's never recommended to hug your pets. Instead, pets are meant to be petted, given food, and allowed into your lap. The cat will not know how you feel about it, and will know that you have your own sense of independence by hugging it, while your cat won't. So why hug?\nAs for your cats, your cat wants to make you its pet! It'll be looking for food, sleep, and a nice comfy place in the sun when in need while giving you love and protection as you watch for dangers. If you insist on hugging, just be sure to do so with your whole attention, which is probably a big no no. Just let your cat have what it needs by giving it those things already.\nWhy hug your cat? Let them stay independent so you can both take care of each other!"

        "output": "I am going to try to roast a pig at home for Thanksgiving this year. What equipment and techniques do I need to successfully get a pig roasted? Are there any particular tips or tricks you’d recommend?\nHunting, gathering, foraging for firewood is one of life’s greatest pleasures! It reminds me of when I was a young boy in West Texas – no better way to burn off excess energy and build muscles!!!\nI thought it was funny that I got all these questions from you after a couple articles you had on home roasted pig.\nIt depends on how you like your pig – well done, medium, rare, crispy skin, crisp inside, not crispy at all, tender?\nI would say you need a fire pit with a lid so if you live in a place with wind you don’t smoke your own house. If you don’t have a fire pit, look for a charcoal pit with a charcoal rake to be a handy tool. If you just have an open pit you might want to set up a fire ring or two at either end of the pit to control the smoke and to keep the wind from sweeping the coals up on you.\nThe fire itself depends on your grill. You can use your portable gas, charcoal or pellet grill or your whole lot grill. Be careful if using the portable grill. If you can’t afford to get rid of that pig but want to do a test shoot – use the portable grill. And do not use the propane or charcoal in your house for it. Use the gas canisters or pellets for that one and turn it on only when you are going to cook your pig.\nIf you have a charcoal grill – light it using a handful of dry wood (I like pines). I will usually wrap a handful of paper towels with dry paper in it. I don’t like it getting wet. It will still burn but not as hot. The fire should be medium or low depending on where you’ve set it.\nThere are some products out there designed to roast the pig. I just don’t trust they are safe so I don’t use them. Maybe you use some of them and you could comment on it. The only way I can think of that would be safe would be to run the grill over propane and turn it off when you put the pig on the grate.\nAs far as wood goes you won’t have to roast real long… maybe 4-6 hours. You may want to cook the meat first over the wood coals or charcoal and then roast the skin. To cook the meat it is better to cook it over low temperatures.\nFirst use a sharp knife to make a deep slit from the neck all the way to the hams. There will be no need to do this on a whole pig because it makes a great oven/firepit. In fact I don’t even like to use a whole pig if I have the choice of a half pig or even just a butt but you get the idea. If you want to use a whole pig, do this at the tail end. But do not try and do this on a pig as large as the ones that come in from the farmers market or you can lose control at the tail end which will cause your fire to go out and you will end up with a wet fire.\nI like to season the inside. I love salt so I will use all manner of salt to begin with. Salt is very important for flavor. If you have some good hot pepper, put it in the meat. You can put it in the belly and let the smoke cook it. If you don’t like it spicy then just rub some into it. I love it when I can get something like a lot of sweet pepper. Sweet pepper is the perfect pepper to pair with the sweetness of the meat. If you can’t find a sweet pepper in the grocery store, they are around every fall. A lot of farms have a lot of green peppers which can make a great roast too.\nOnce you take the meat off and clean it up, the next step is to wrap it in a piece of fat or bacon or something to keep in the juices. You will need a big piece of fat bacon, a side of bacon, a side of sausage, beef short ribs, ribs (but not turkey or chicken fat or even lard will work). I also use good quality pork lard but I don’t often have it because it takes a couple of days to freeze and I don’t want to take time to defrost it for one pork roast.\nYou now have some great meat that has been seasoned and put in some fat which will not only keep the inside warm but also keep the outer meat from getting too tough the next day. I would say that you can also put it in a roasting pan with some dry wood coals under the meat – but the next day you won’t"

That way it won't overheat from constantly plugging it in and out, and can run in stand-by mode when it's plugged in. \nIf you want to use it when you're out of the house, get a second rechargeable battery so that you can work for extended periods without letting it drain to zero, since it'll be too heavy to drag around once it gets too cold.\nSince you're only cutting sheet rock, you could also consider going with a chainsaw.  That would probably be a lot easier to find a good rated one at a cheaper price, and if you're only doing sheet rock cutting, it's also a safer tool.\n\nA: Use a Makita 18V LXT Cordless Saw.  It is not cheap ($800 at Sears) but this is the saw I use on projects around my home.\nI have bought these from Sears direct on their website. That is the closest I have found to the original source.\n\n\nA: I use a DEWALT 2.0AH Lithium Ion Cordless Saw.\nMy favorite feature is that it has a dust pickup system, so it keeps the inside of your saw free from dust. \nHere's a video I found of a guy doing some light dust removal. I've tried it and it works like a charm. You just pull the handle to trigger...\nI was very happy with that one. I had a bad experience with an older corded, cordless saw that I had, but that one was faulty. A friend at work told me about the DEWALT saw after I asked. I was very happy I found it.\n\nA: I like the Stanley ST250. I have it, and am very happy with it. It's a good deal cheaper than the Dewalt, and it looks very similar. The one I like is the \"Black\" model. It gives you more metal cutting than the DeWalt, and is only $20 easier.\n\nA: Have you tried the Black & Decker 3/4HP, 16-1/4in Gas Wood/Metal Saw (302T)?\n\nIt looks like a nice saw in many ways.  I'd like it.\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Decker-302T-Gas-Wood-Metal/dp/B000Y77XI0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1228622285&sr=8-1\nI found a used model on eBay for $189.50, but it looks like some used saws are more expensive than new ones.\n\nA: I always like Hitachi. Also, they offer a free service called Home Pros. It's a warranty for 2 years included in the deal. That would allow you to get yourself a new saw in case it happened to work out in your home.\nhttp://www.hitachipower.com/consumer/tool/index\n\nA: I have not used the Sawzall, but I use the Porter Cable and while it is more expensive than other \"cheaper\" options, it is an incredibly strong and reliable tool. I have dropped it several feet and it still works. It is one of the most durable power tools I have ever used. And I use the battery model, so the cord has never been necessary.  As long as you are working in a reasonably well ventilated and dust free environment, it will work as well as most cheap saws."

He really is. I know some of his other songs I just don't like. However, songs like The River Of Dreams, Pressure, Only The Good Die Young, The Downeaster 'Alexa\nI don't listen to him much.

My favorite songs are Only The Good Die Young, For Shame Of Doing Wrong, New York State Of Mind, Piano Man, We Didn't Start The Fire\nAnd I would have to agree with one of the commenters that he is probably better then a lot of other musicians but don't try to deny that.\nI am hoping he gets back into making albums again.

        "output": "How do you become an author? Where do you find ideas for stories?” At sixteen years old, I was asked this question a lot. I was the young writer in my school and had just taken up writing and publishing novels. It was pretty surprising to be asked these questions. I’ve always had an urge to write stories with various characters, but the biggest motivation came when I was nine and I realized my family was an average one. My father has a good job, a wife and a daughter (both living at home). They are the same as every other family out there. And this isn’t just the US either. I’ve lived abroad, visited multiple countries and have seen numerous families all around the world. I’d be hard pressed now to say I haven’t seen a one that doesn’t resemble this.\nSo, my novels focus on a family that’s pretty average. Every girl likes to read these stories because she wants to be the hero, to save someone who is being hurt and to find love. The idea is very simple is it not?\nI realized how many similarities a normal family has, and decided to focus on my own family, and to add my own tweaks to it, but to keep the essence. This gave birth to my novels, which focus on my family. My family as they really are. I wanted everyone to see the real family, with its good sides and flaws. I really believe that one should always be real and not pretend the world is like Disney, which it obviously isn’t. We are all made of imperfect beings and we never get it right, but I believe our families are the greatest gift we’re given, and they need to be appreciated.\nSo, this is my reason for writing, and the reason I wish to share with everyone that has a family who are special, unique, and amazing.\nI believe many adults will take away from this story a lesson that can and will change their lives for the better, and children will be inspired to do better for themselves, their family and their future.\nI know I have been inspired by my family to become the best person I can, and after reading this story, I truly can’t see anyone who isn’t touched by the story. It is truly moving, and a story that makes me proud, for now I can see where I got my inspiration from."

They are generally 20 to 27 inches tall and 9 to 17 pounds with solid colors and a multitude of patterns including: Black and Tan, Blue, Brindle, Chocolate, Fawn, and Smoke.\nCatahoula Cur was a popular dog breed. Its known as a large mixed breed dog, and it was used to help take care of cattle in the Louisiana and Texas regions. Now its one of the top ten working dog breeds in the United States.\nBasset hound. Bassett hound.\nThe Basset Hound is the largest of the American hound breeds. Bassets were used to hunt rabbits from behind, and dogs that are too active dont make good hounds. That means Basset hounds must be calm, patient and well balanced.\nBasset Hounds have a broad, flat face with no stop. Their muzzles are soft and smooth on both the upper and lower jaws. They have very short, soft ears and small eyes. They have a rather small, wedge-shaped head. They have small, flat, wide noses.\nFor example, according to a 2004 study at the veterinary school of Loma Linda University, two breeds that are commonly crossed with bassets are German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers.\nBasset Hound vs Beagle\nBeagle  15.1 inches. Basset Hound  15.5 inches.\nFemale Beagles are generally smaller than males, growing up to 23 pounds. Male Beagles grow to between 20-32 pounds. Female Basset Hounds are around 26 pounds, while male Bassets can weigh anywhere between 24-35 pounds.\nThe Pug breeds height varies from 11.2 to 15.0 inches. This puppy will grow between 7.5 and more than 22 kg (16.5 and more than 49 pounds).\nIt is known, that a short-nosed dog breed was used by the Egyptians for hunting the water animals, while the Basset Hound, although short-nosed, has a rather high nose.\nThe Labrador Retriever is the tallest breed in this group, standing at a minimum of 19 inches at the withers. The Beagle and the Bassett span from 15-16 inches. And the Bichon Frise is the smallest, although other breeds like the toy poodle and miniature dachshund span from 11 to 12 inches.\nChihuahuas can be small as a beagle or big as a Great Dane. In between youll pretty much find every size known to man. However, it is important to note that what is a Chihuahua depends on its length. It is determined by whether it is taller than 4.5 inches or not.\nBasset Hounds are typically 20-22 inches in length, including the tail. They weigh approximately 31-40 pounds, but this can vary widely based on whether the breed is active or sedentary.\nThe Basset Griffon Vendene is not a mix of the Basset Hound and the French Griffon. It is another different breed altogether.\nThe best Basset Hound breeds to mix with are:Beagle  A Bassets second-best friend, the beagle also has an enthusiastic personality, is friendly and loyal and is a great fit for Bassets.Dachshund  A Dachshund can provide the right intelligence and athleticism that Basset Hounds need.\nA Basset can be a mix of other breeds, such as:Beagle  This breed tends to be a larger version of the Basset.Labradoodle  This is a popular breed because it mixes a Lab with a poodle.\nWhen used alone, either Bassett or Bassett hounds are often considered terriers.

        "output": "Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?\nKobe beef is famous for not being all that famous. Only 6000 Kobe-certified cows are slaughtered per year, and the animals have been selectively bred for more than a century for ultra-luxe eating.\nWhy is Kobe beef so expensive? The high price points can primarily be attributed to the strict quality control standards the animals are required to meet. Kobe beef is only recognized by its distinctive brand stamp, and cattle are only labeled with the coveted designation when they meet certain production requirements.\nWhat Makes Kobe Beef So Special?\nThe only way to get certified as a Kobe beef is if your beef must have a minimum of 120 days on feed. The process takes 21 months, as the beef also requires at least three years of being raised at a feedlot farm.\nFurthermore, to get the coveted Japanese Kobe beef label, your animal must only have been fed grass for 35 days after slaughter. Most beef, on the other hand, could spend up to half a year being kept in a feedlot before slaughtered and sold.\nAnother issue with the way it’s produced is that cows are slaughtered in a specific way that keeps all the fat and tendons intact for better taste and texture. To avoid this, the animals are slaughtered in the butcher shop, not on the farm. This makes it more costly to produce than other types of meat.\nThe most expensive Kobe steak costs about $51 per serving, according to Forbes, making it over 10 times more expensive than your regular Angus steak. But don’t get fooled by these numbers – don’t expect a $51 steak to be as expensive as it seems.\nAnother aspect to be considered is that the price of Kobe beef varies by the method of production, including where the cow is raised, where the beef was produced, and then finally how it is sold to the public.\nThat being said, there are some beef producers who try to replicate Kobe’s beef-producing process and replicate a similar taste by growing grass on a ranch, which is still not the same as what Kobe cows get to eat. But since some bovines still aren’t used to eating this kind of grass, the flavor is not quite as flavorful as it is for a certified Kobe cow.\nWhat distinguishes the quality of Kobe beef from other kinds is the fat: the high concentration of marbles, or fat beads, inside the skin. These “buta” (Japanese slang for beef) have small fat globules called “marbling” that are so tight and small that they can’t penetrate beyond the first layer of muscle fibers when cooked, which means that they don’t leave any flavor on the surface.\nKobe’s marbles are larger than the marbling found in New York strip steaks, which allows them to break down into more flavorful juices when they’re cooked. These marbled areas are what make Kobe beef so highly sought-after.\nWhen Kobe cattle are slaughtered for their beef, the fat will usually be removed from the meat, but these marbles can be preserved if they’re sliced carefully from the cut, allowing all of the juices to be retained (it also makes these cuts look gorgeous). That’s why, instead of cutting these marbled areas from the cuts, chefs typically serve them whole.\nThe “cut of the beef” is all about how thick or thin the meat is, and the type of cuts are determined by the breed of animal. The meat is sliced into steaks called fillet (also known as “T-bones”), filets, cubes (cubed), rib-eyes, strip, and porter house.\nWhen it is sliced and served in whole portions, Kobe beef is prized for its rich taste and is considered one of the finest cuts of beef. However, after cooking, the fat melts and creates oil that will seep through the meat and add flavor and richness to it. So when sliced, the fat tends to be more evident, making it look less attractive than when it’s served as whole portions.\nAre the cuts different?\nDifferent cuts produce different flavors, which is why Kobe beef is a popular choice for chefs who wish to showcase the full capabilities of their cooking talent. Kobe cuts are categorized according to their thickness, which affects the fat content of each meat (the more fat, the more flavorful the beef should be).\nFillet cuts are the most common choices for dining-out restaurants. They come with a thin center and are considered a tender, flavorful cut of beef, so they are ideal for cooking. The thin fillet cuts are also delicious when smoked and roasted.\nA filet is a steak cut from the ribs that can include the rib section or the loin (in the case of sirloin).

In fact, you need to change your antiperspirant routine, as you may be putting your skin at risk.

This will remove dead skin from the surface and get your pores clean.\nIt doesn’t work. Just because you are getting your armpits clean, doesn’t mean that it will still smell fresh. If your armpits are still stinking, you need to address the cause – if your armpits is stinking, they aren’t clean.\nHere is the good news. You can use simple household ingredients to take care of your armpits!\nThis all natural way to remove the stink from your armpits will be your new life saver. Follow the below step-by-step for a clean and fresh way to stay cool this summer.\nThis will gently moisturize and clean the skin and remove any surface dead skin, making it more effective.\nSo you don’t have to worry about any of that.\nOnce your armpits are clean, you will still need to exfoliate your underarms to get rid of the dead skin. The same concept as your hands, but in a different area.\nWe are going to use a washcloth to remove any leftover dirt and grime without using an exfoliating cleanser. Your washcloth should have a smooth surface that is free of microbes. But, just like you shouldn’t use fabric softeners on your clothes, a non-sterile washcloth can harbor some pesky bad bacteria. We are cleaning the surface, we still need to exfoliate so make sure it is dead clean.\nLet’s get this over with, we’re going to exfoliate armpits!\nWe’re going to use an anti-bacterial exfoliant that can remove surface dead skin. You don’t want to over do your skin. Remember to clean your armpits, but you do not want to peel the skin with harsh chemicals.\nA little goes a long way. Start on a single underarm and work your way down and out.\nOnce you feel that it’s time, you can rinse off and wipe off the excess product. Make sure that you only apply just enough to get the job done. Using too much can burn your skin. It’ll do more harm than good and cause breakouts!\nHere are two ways you can make your life easier.\nWashcloth: This is inexpensive, reusable and great for removing your exfoliant off the skin.\nMicrowave: A fresh hot washcloth and two microwaves? This is a pretty easy trick to make your life easier. Start your microwave without the pot.\nAfter about 10 seconds to ensure your pot is warm, transfer the hot water into your washcloth to soothe your skin. For ease, I found the best way to exfoliate armpits is by using a washcloth. I usually use an old towel, but it can do a nice job.\nIf your microwave is ready, place the pot inside to soak up some of the heat. If not, let it sit until it makes a noise. We don’t want you to accidentally touch a hot wire.\nFor this, the washcloth is your best bet. It’ll be a little rough on your skin. I’ve tried it with and without a paper towel and it’s better without one.\nYou will also notice a lot of dead skin floating on the surface. This is great because it allows you to know exactly what you used and how long you used it.\nThese are only a few exfoliants to help freshen your armpits and they don’t require a trip to the store every time you wash your armpits. It’ll save you time and money. It’s also a good idea to start a routine, because it gives you something you can count on every time you get a shower.\nBut keep in mind, that after a while, you will outgrow some of these products. You will want something that not only smells great but also contains ingredients that are gentle for your armpits. It’s important to choose a product that really works and won’t dry your skin that it’s out of control.\nThe same thing is true for washing your hair. You need to pay attention to your scalp and not the product you add to your hair.\nIf you want to find a good one, we made a list here: Best Natural And Organic Products For Hair.\nWhen it comes down to it, any exfoliating product should do"

The snails are known as Nautilus, from which escargot comes from.\nThe snail are usually cultivated in captivity for about 5 years. During that time the snails create their shell in order to protect themselves from threats like predators. This is done by the snail pushing all their food into the shell to protect it, which is called “nourishing” their snail.\nSnails are small animals which live in shells on the mud or under stones. When snails enter food into their shells for protection they are also said to eat. When looking for food snails will climb onto stones to reach high places where the food is more plentiful.\nSnails are the most common species of shellfish in the world, with over 40,000 species. In fact, snails are the largest taxonomic order of Mollusca. Their existence, and especially their eating habits, are vital to the health and well-being of ecosystems in both the marine and terrestrial environments.\nEscargot is a form of edible fresh, cooked or pickled snails which are typically served in restaurant French restaurants and as a course in many French meals.\nThey are also known as escargot, escarga, escarga, escar-gota, escargot-a, escar-got-a, and escargot-a.\nEscargot is a type of mollusc or gastropod and has been served as a delicacy in France since the Middle Ages. It’s typically served with bread, butter and garlic. The mollusks range in size depending on whether they are from the edible species of the French snails, which includes a variety of snails including the common garden snail.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, it is sold loose.\nThey start as unshelled snails. They are eaten raw, with bread, butter and garlic.\nEscargot (snails)\nThe use of escargot in the Philippines is to use and consume at home. And it is also used to feed pets.\nEscargot is a type of mollusc (gastropod) that you can buy at local food markets, and they are served with butter, garlic and bread. They come in various sizes but are usually large enough for you to pick up with one hand.\nSnails’ shells are filled with calcium carbonate, and their shells can be a good source of calcium and other nutrients.\nSnails’ shells are hard and can be a durable material, so you can use snail shells for furniture – you can add them to the walls of your home to decorate your room.\nAnd when you’re making a furniture, you can also use some parts from it, like snails’ shells, which can be a nice design element.\nWhat is the difference between escargot and snail?\nThe most obvious difference between snail and escargot is that snails are edible, whereas escargot is not. Another difference is that escargot can be cooked, whereas snails cannot. Snails are also more fragile than escargot.\nSee also How to get to San Blas Bahamas?\nSnail butter is a thick creamy white buttery sauce made from whole egg yolks, butter, flour, milk, a tablespoon of nutmeg, one tablespoon of onion power and a cup of heavy cream. When the snail butter is made snails are the eggs that are used in the recipe.\nAlthough they are common, snails are not commonly sold in the United States. If you are lucky enough to find a market that sells them, you can purchase one for about $2, but they may also be available online.\nSnail eggs cannot be eaten on their own, so they are often cooked.\nIs it rare to find snails?\nWhat is escargot like?\nSnail eggs do not come from baby snails but from their shell. After mating, some snails lay eggs, which are in the shells of their mother. They have a similar structure to other kinds of animals, which are made up of many parts working together to achieve an end result.\nSnails are considered a delicacy in many parts of the"

Meteorites. What are meteorites? They are tiny or small pieces of rock that are fragments of asteroids that have been either melted into a liquid and then solidified, or they are broken off as pieces. Meteoritic materials are mostly iron and nickel, and they are very rare.\n\nAsteroid. An asteroid is a relatively small rocky body circling the Sun within its own orbit in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\n\nMeteorites are a type of meteoroid that has impacted Earth's atmosphere. Some meteoroids are able to withstand the heat of entry into the Earth's atmosphere and crash without being vaporized.\n\nFor this chapter we will first try to answer the question of \"Meteorites.\"\n\nMeteorite. Meteorites is defined as \"a piece of matter that enters the Earth's atmosphere and that comes back to the Earth's surface, where it is caught by a human. This occurs because most meteorites are small and do not vaporize or burn up before reaching the surface.\" ( _T_. _H_. _G_. _Gardner_ , _U_. _S_. _Prices_ , _and_ , _G_. _D._ _Masters_ , 1986, _Vol_. _1_ , _The Meteorites of the Earth_.) The size of a meteorite can vary from a few millimeters to a hundred kilograms or more.\n\nMeteorites are the only objects in space with which we can make a close personal contact. There exist only limited opportunities to collect or examine meteorites as most were not recovered in time for people to gather them up. There are other collections, including some that were not in close contact with the Earth, but they were not considered in this book's consideration since they were not collected by the writer.\n\nMetors, asteroids, and meteoroids all come from the same space debris or body. So it appears that they all might be called \"meteorites,\" but for the purposes of this book it appears that they might all be called meteorites. Why is this important?\n\nThe only known body in space that is formed of rock and metal is the Earth and the Moon. The only objects in space that are formed of the same matter as meteorites are asteroids and the Moon. Therefore, _all_ rocks and metals that we encounter either on land or on our water are by nature meteorites, or meteoritical.\n\nHere are a few questions to ask yourself, since we are going to try to answer these questions: What"

Can you give me a recipe for making tahini?\nThe basic recipe is quite simple: Put a few tablespoons of tahini in a bowl and stir in a little of the water from the sesame seeds. This way tahini will become very thick, almost as it is sold at the markets. But the tahini still needs some other flavors so that it can become delicious.\nIn a frying pan, heat a little oil (for example, canola oil) and fry onion, garlic, lemon and sometimes some parsley or cilantro. Use salt and black pepper to taste. And then put on top of the falafel as if it was salad.\nI just have one question. It was my great-grandmother who taught me how to make the best falafels and the secret to their success was the way she pressed them to the pan, the tahini in the middle & how many you put on one plate & the way they were served.

        "instruction": "When was Canada colonized?",
        "output": "When was Canada colonized?\nCanadians have no idea when their nation was colonized; many confuse it with the time of the first known peoples to live here, the Clovis people which date back 11,000 years. What we did know was that it was very bad and most of the colonists were white and only very well-off white or in the process of becoming that, and most indigenous people were not treated well. A lot of the people were simply murdered or were worked to the point of exhaustion and death.\nMost people are not aware that Canada was colonized much later than the United States. Most people think that Canada was colonized in the 17th century, the same as the United States. However, that was the case only in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. By the start of the 18th century, only about 40,000 were colonized in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and what would later become Prince Edward Island. By the end of the 18th century, there were about 200,000 and by the 1820s about 400,000. So, the British were relatively late to establish their North American Empire. This is why there are so many people who have a hard time believing this.\nAnother reason people don’t believe we were colonized is because, prior to this, we never had a written history. By the time we had started to write things, no longer lived in isolation.\nThe colonization process\nThe first major effort to colonize Canada was not so much by the British Crown but by private investors. We have to realize that in order for colonization to take place, a substantial number of people had to move a great distance to an unknown and often hostile land. Those moving were not all from the British Isles and were not all from wealth. They were seeking gold, land, to be with family and friends, etc.\nFirst, we colonized eastern Canada. Most of this was done by small-scale operations, and in those days, a lot of men traveled to these areas and married local women. It was also much more difficult during that era to travel to Canada and get to know people. So, these small-scale operations had a lot of children that, due to the nature of the time, were raised as Christian and adopted or renamed new last names. This means that not everyone has the same last name as their mothers’ last name. It is for this reason that some people in eastern Canada will insist to someone else that they are 100% European when genealogical research can easily show that they are not.\nThen in 1815, we began colonizing of the North West. Here the colonists came into contact one of the most fiercely independent and dangerous groups of indigenous people: the Blackfoot. It was a very violent time and many men died. A few were killed by Blackfoot warriors; the rest were killed trying to find game to hunt for the winter or getting caught in the bitter and freezing cold.\nThe majority of European men who migrated to Canada arrived by the end of the 19th century; this was not the case in the West. The most recent arrivals were men who were either forced to migrate by the United States, or who were part of the Great Migration. The 19th-century migration was driven by the climate, economic conditions and by a few European nations, like Scotland. It was also by the North West Company and the Hudson Bay Company.\nIn 1885, we had 23,000 Europeans living in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta. This was the largest European group that could be found in western Canada at the time. Within a few decades, immigration slowed down due to the Great Depression, and the population began to decline.\nAs of 2011, there are 3.6 million Canadians, 0.5% of whom could not self-identify as one of us. That is quite a low number for a population that is 99.5% French Canadian and 0.5% others.\nThe second wave of colonization\nSome of those who did not self-identify as French Canadian or Inuk Canadian were descendants of colonists who arrived in the early 1900s or later.\nThe population exploded in the post-war era, not just with people who came to Canada from the United States. We also saw thousands of immigrants from Asia, the Middle East, former Yugoslavia and elsewhere.\nIf you look at immigration at the provincial level it is easy to see that most immigrants choose the province where they can have the most say in terms of their religion, language, values, etc. For example, in Quebec (the province that most people think of when they think of the French) 66% of immigrants go to Ontario and 6"

Do you think there is something you can do to reduce the craziness? Is it true that you can control your device a bit more, and give you more freedom and health, at the same time?\n\nYes, you can. In fact, it is the only way you can.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, I will describe in a story what rewiring your mind to live well with technology means, and what life looks like when you succeed at this. Then I will present some suggestions drawn from experts who are working on this problem. They include Gary Vaynerchuk, who is one of the most successful entrepreneurs of my generation and whose advice I follow, and Peter Diamandis, who has been a successful entrepreneur and inventor, and is the co-founder and director of Singularity University (SU). I will also discuss some other advice and some examples that I have gleaned from others. The third part of this book is one big example where I have attempted to live the life of tech rewiring.\n\nI will be taking about technology, but you don't need to be a techie. The concepts and ideas of reskilling and rescheduling are not specific to any technology or industry, but are important wherever you work. I believe that the tech rewiring mindset is an important part of the modern world that will help you in all spheres of life  no matter what your profession.\n\nIf you think you should be focusing more on your job or business, but find that you are being distracted and that you are missing opportunities, read on....\n\nIf you are worried about keeping up with technology, or thinking that the time that would be better spent doing other things, then read on....\n\nIf you think that technology shouldn't be getting into your head, or you should have been able to avoid it but you didn't, then read on....\n\nIf you think you should know what is going on in your child's school life, even when you don't have time to check your phone every day, then read on....\n\nIf you don't have enough time to focus on your family, so you can't respond to your kids or keep your family healthy, or you can't be there even when they need you, then read on....\n\nIf you can't go out of town because you are always at the phone, then read on....\n\nIf you are not able to get enough sleep because you are distracted by your smartphone, and/or you can't disconnect from your work when you come home, then read on....\n\nIf you don't have the time to do the things that you like because of your work, or you don't even know anymore what your work is, except for looking at your screen all day, then read on....\n\nIf you wake up and your first thought is what e-mail you missed or who is calling you, and how long your next task is, and what the next call is going to be about, then read on....\n\nIf your life is becoming dominated by technology and you don't think that it should, then read on....\n\nIf you want to free up more of your time, and have more in your life to get things done, and don't know how you can, then read on....\n\nIf you have started to think of your phone as an extension of yourself and cannot imagine your life without it, then read on....\n\nIf you feel a void and yearn for what you used to enjoy, without feeling that you have the time for this, and not even knowing why you used to enjoy it, but you know that things used to be different, then read on....\n\nIf you are overwhelmed by technology, and find it hard to control your emotions when you are frustrated because of it, if you feel you are struggling to live by your values with the current technology, then read on....\n\nIf you think that"

A small-scale form of government (oligarchy, monarchy, archon, or democracy) was the method by which these city-states were governed.\nIt was during the Hellenistic age that much of the ancient Greeks view of an afterlife became established and came to include the modern view of heaven and hell.\nSome thought that when the body died, the soul was released from the physical body. Others believed that when a human died they became a star or an animal on Earth. Still others believed in the idea of an afterlife, also known as a Hades, where you could go once you had died.\nPagan Religion. In the beginning there was nothing but the Void, from which the Prime Creator emerged. The next gods to emerge were the Trickster gods, who were very cunning and conniving; the first of these was called Shua. It was his job to create the rest of the gods. The Trickster gods came to the humans as well, offering them knowledge.\nBabylonians were polytheistic, but they also believed in a single supreme god called Marduk, who was their head god, or the sun god, and creator of the universe.\nWhen did the afterlife come into existence among ancient Egyptians?\nAn important point to remember is that the Egyptians didnt believe in death (or eternal life).  So even though some Egyptians would have thought life on in the afterlife (including being born again as a new member of the elite) were the ultimate goal, it wouldnt necessarily mean they were seeking everlasting life.\nIn pagan religion, it is believed that death is the end. This is because the soul is believed to vanish after death without any idea of a resurrection.\nIn their religious beliefs, ancient Egyptians believed that the gods controlled every aspect of their lives, whether it be their fate or their future. They had their own ideas about the afterlife and the world beyond the mortal realm.  So even though some Egyptians would have thought life on in the afterlife (including being born again as a new member of the elite) were the ultimate goal, it wouldnt necessarily mean they were seeking everlasting life.\nTheir beliefs in an afterlife, however, were a bit different. They believed that when someone died, they would go to the underworld. They would live there with their relatives for three days. They thought they were actually still alive. After that, they would go to the other world.\nThe Ancient Egyptians lived on a limited time span."

        "output": "What is Gremolata?\n\nIn many cases, a gremolata is not a \"recipe\" in exactly the same sense as an Italian cooking recipe. Instead, this is a collection of items that a more seasoned cook knows should be added to a dish, that are usually finely chopped and mixed together prior to use and, typically, are never written down. The reason is that every culinary expert, and every cook, has a different version of the \"ideal\" gremolata â to the point that, in some cases, even the individual components may be called by different names. Often the gremolata components in different recipes are used in proportions that would be considered unusual and, in addition, rarely are they used in exactly the same order.\n\nThat being said, the following list should serve as a good starting point in your quest to create a homemade gremolata:\n\n  * 7 to 10 basil leaves (about 1/2 cup chopped).\n  * 1/4 clove garlic\n  * 1/4 cup chopped parsley\n  * About 1/4 cup chopped lemon zest\n\nYou can keep the mixture in a freezer bag or jar, but I recommend the quick and easy method of just putting it in the mixing bowl.\nFACT\n\nA recipe for tomato and oregano salad was published by Italian culinary expert Giovanni Battista Scalise in 1723.\n\nA few decades later, a similar recipe with an addition of marjoram (in English, called \"oregano\"), and it was called \"orecchiette with tomatoes, garlic and marjoram.\"\n\nThis was just a hint of one possible direction that the tomato and oregano salad could have taken. In 1822, an article in the _Gazzetta Piemontese_ newspaper made the recipe even sweeter: \"the ripe and sun-dried tomatoes of Ticino are chopped, mixed with a little vin santo [sweet wine], salt, pepper and marjoram; this is a very interesting recipe.\"\n\nFACT\n\nMarjoram is the only herb that has both Latin and classical Greek names.\n\nIt comes from the Greek word Î¼Î±ÏÎ³Î¿ÏÎ±Î¿Ï (maroÃºras: \"dried garlic\").\n\nFrom there, the ingredients of the gremolata became various spices: for example, rosemary, coriander, orange peel, alliums, fennel flower, lavender, basil, sage, thyme (it is the only gremolata recipe not including marjoram) â to which they all refer as oregano.\n\nIt is not just the name that changed; according to a variety of historians, the recipe was transformed into a variety of different dishes, based on the availability of the ingredients of the time.\n\nIn the 1800s, gremolata became one of the main \"pre-aroma\" condiments. In 1857, in the book entitled The \"Recipe\" for the Pasta, it was called \"gremolata, marjoram, oregano, basil and rosemary.\"\n\nGremolata is also one of the ingredients of \"Pesto Genovese\": the famous sauce of Liguria that was first written around 1078 CE.\n\nSome versions of gremolata add other herbs, sometimes whole and at other times finely chopped: thyme, sage, marjoram, lovage, rosemary, bay leave, horseradish (this last one is usually used instead of coriander), garlic.\n\nFACT\n\nThe gremolate recipe has changed several times during the 2,000 years since when it was first created in a monastery in France. It is said that, since that time, the recipe has been changed more than 1,600 times!\n\nThe oldest gremolata to be preserved in any recipe book is this one that we came across in the 1300s in a book compiled by an Italian monk:\n\n## 30\n\n## Marseillaise\n\n**This was also a soup of the \"poor people,\" so to speak, in those years.**\n\nThe first recipes of what could be considered a \"true\" marseillaise soup appear in France in the 1400s:\n\n  * One of the oldest versions was published in 1441 in Florence, as a recipe book by the priest Agnolo del Pugliese.\n  * A little later, in Piacenza,"

        "output": "Why did humans evolve to believe in God?\nScience explains almost everything, and yet we still have a desire for transcendent meaning and even a need for God, says David Albert\nDustin Euston\nMon Feb 13, 2012 - 2:57 pm EST Sat Jun 19, 2021 - 10:42 am EDT\nFebruary 13, 2012 (LifeSiteNews.com)  If there is something that science has been unable to explain, we tend today to believe that it must be God, as if that is somehow a better explanation than any other. A prime example of this belief is the claim that we have an inborn drive to believe in God. If this were really true, it would be a clear explanation of how a God-shaped hole could exist inside each of us, and what can be called a missing link in the case for God.\nBut a closer examination of just what this claim really constitutes, and even what the people who make the claim are actually asserting, raises troubling questions.\nThe idea that we have an inborn drive to believe in God that would explain why we believe in God at all is usually put forth in one of two ways. First, it is posited that there is something in the human experience that makes believing in God an easy position to take. And, second, there is the claim that this drive is some sort of universal, basic human experience. By these two means, then, the idea is suggested that this experience is actually fundamental to the human experience, and therefore some sort of explanation must be given as to what exactly this would be that would generate our experience of God.\nSince the first claim suggests that there is something in human experience that actually makes belief in God plausible, it would seem that if it is true that the human experience contains something that would make belief in God possible, then it would be difficult to say that it is a mistake to believe in God. Since the second claim asserts that the drive to believe in God is just another part of how our brains work, then it would also seem that even if there were nothing that would make the idea of God plausible, something about our brains actually does make it so that we could come to believe that God exists.\nSo what exactly is this drive or this experience or this something that makes religious belief possible and that explains why we would even have the idea of God in the first place?\nWhat is usually proposed is that the experience of a person feels like there is something that is trying to connect to a larger reality (though these people usually do not use those words) that does so in some of the same or similar ways in which science itself does. They are saying that they feel they have a desire for something more. So, what is the more that these persons and scientists themselves are feeling is a desire for the truth. This desire, when satisfied by science and even by natural theology, is what these people believe makes them feel satisfied and happy. This need for truth, even if it is satisfied by science or a naturalistic explanation of God, is thought of as what makes God even possible. And that this would make it possible for people to believe God exists is the basic idea that drives this argument.\nBut this idea does not work, because it is based on what they are saying that every person is just having this feeling of a desire for truth. So, the problem is that they are not just saying that they have the feeling that science fills the same void that God does, and even that science fills them up somehow (though others insist that this is not the case!). They are also saying, in effect, that every person has this same desire, and if so, this is not even a good explanation of why we would believe in God.\nSince there is nothing in our experience that would even give us the idea of anything that is outside of the truth, and since we are all experiencing the same kind of a desire for the truth, there is nothing to give us the idea that someone might call what we encounter God. We all experience the truth, and it is not the truth that we find within the realm of what science has discovered. And, so, if nothing in our experience or in ourselves gives us the idea of God, then God cannot exist.\nBut is it true that there is something about our experience or about what we are that actually does fulfill that need for truth and for a connection to a larger reality? No. It is just not true. Science shows that the world we find ourselves in is all that it is that everything we see is all there is to see; there is nothing about what science discovers that would give us the idea of something greater in any way that could give us the idea of a supreme being. And, so, this second claim also is not correct.\nMoreover, though it might seem that this third idea is based on an assumption that all"

Because we believe that all living things are made by a Creator and not man-made\nYes, for the sake of this argument, we may assume that God is the Creator. So how about we assume the same about Satan. It doesnt change anything on your argument.\ndaveyone1 says:\nThe question is not why do so many scientists refuse to believe in God or Satan, but why do so many scientists refuse to believe in evolution.\nOh really!\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/02/2/l_022_summary.html\nhttp://www.mddev.org/blog/2009/07/evolutionary-research-summary/\nhttp://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC228.html\nhttp://www.answersingenesis.org/Creation-evolution-answers/chapter-9/evolution-theory\nWhat do these three links have to do with my assertion that scientists refuse to believe in evolution? They are scientific papers and reports that say the evolutionary theory is far from complete and in a number of ways is wrong. No scientific paper, report, or other evidence presented can be cited in support of evolution because it is impossible to say where it is wrong until it has been proven and accepted by the majority of scientists.\nSorry, but youre wrong. These are just a few of the hundreds of actual scientific papers on the subject of evolution.\nDo those refute the theory? Do they even touch on the subject? In the words of the late Yogi Berra, I dunno, man, I really dunno.\nThe fact that there are so very few such papers (at least compared with the volume of papers on the subject) suggests to me that the field is pretty much settled, to include the claim that ID is somehow a different scientific hypothesis, worthy of consideration.\nYoure wrong. I dont actually know you and have not spent the time to study anything about you, but I think youre wrong in that assertion. I think you just dont know what evolution means, how evolution proceeds, that evolution is just a method and not a theory, or you dont have enough of a background to understand what evolution is. Its not a theory in your head. Its a method. It is, however, a theory as one aspect of overall evolutionary theory. It is the theory of how life changes through change in genetics that is, in fact, testable by the research. That includes all the theories about the origin of genes from chemicals in the first place.\nHow does one test for something that happened before life? Isnt it just a theory?\nAnd Ive presented you evidence that does not support your beliefs. You have offered no evidence that does.\nSo, you see? You cant prove your point because there is no point your point that evolution is scientifically proven.\nBut youve also presented an argument against evolution with no evidence other than hearsay that is no evidence at all.\nWhich is it? And which hypothesis is closer to the truth?\n@David Young:\nIf you are going to quote from the Preamble of the Constitution of the United States, why dont you also quote from the second paragraph of the second section?\nThats the one where it says Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion.\nhttp://www2.cdn.knight.com/130/1563/160/2ee582fe-f618-4b45-903f-513d6a1d02dc.pdf\nThe second paragraph of the second section of the Preamble (to the Constitution of the United States) of the United States has been interpreted since 1878 as guaranteeing an individual right to engage in atheistic expression that is equal in status to the right to freedom of exercise of religion. Since the Supreme Court in Zorach v. Clauson\nFirst: You failed to provide a citation to the Constitution you claimed was the source for the right to engage in atheistic expression that is equal in status to the right to freedom of exercise of religion.\nSecond: The Constitution, as it was written, does not reference such a right. This is not to say it would not be a good idea for the US Constitution to have such a provision. It sure would have been nice to have had a section defining the separation of church and military.\nAnd, again, because you seem to be incapable of doing your own research (or because you just dont care to) Im posting the above link so you can make up your own mind what you think about the above citation and what it says.\nNow Ive said before that the US does"

I am interested in trying some Mauritian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Mine Frite?\nAs far as Ive been able to find out Mine Frite is a Creole dish that was prepared in the past but is difficult to cook and serve today. It would likely be hard to find in a restaurant too.\nFor me, Mauritian food is an acquired taste! If youve been to Mauritius you know that its a melting pot of cultures with Indian, French, African and Chinese influences. Mauritian food may look like you made it on the spot in a hurry, and that is often the case.\nMauritian dishes are a blend of local ingredients, spices, and cooking techniques. Dishes are full of vegetables and generally include a combination of herbs, chilli, spices, rice, and fried fish.\nMy suggestion is to visit Le Bistro and try the dishes. Le Bistro, in the old Port Louis, is a classic restaurant run by Tresor and Renee. They are delightful hosts and serve wonderful Mauritian food.\nWhat are some vegetarian food choices in Mauritius?\nMauritian cuisine tends to be meat and seafood oriented. There are a few vegetarian options though. Most vegetarian dishes I found had at least a little meat (Ive put them in italics below.) You can ask in restaurants to substitute an ingredient for something else, but the chefs do not make a special sauce. Instead they use coconut milk to add taste and texture.\nWe also found some nice vegetarian options in the market.\nHere is a recipe for a classic Mauritian salad: Vegetarian Mutton Curry Salad.\nThere is some good vegetarian food on the island, but it is more about what is prepared. I found little, if anything, in the food outlets in hotels etc.\nI came across very few vegetarian restaurants in Mauritius; but if you keep an open mind you can still enjoy the local flavours.\nLe Bistro & Les Jardins de Sefou, both run by Tresor and Renee, are excellent restaurants. You will enjoy the warm atmosphere and the friendly and well-spoken staff, plus the great food and unique design.\nThe Mutton Curry Salad in Les Jardins de Sefou is one of the best Ive ever had. It is a blend of potatoes and mixed vegetables with the meat made of potatoes and coconut milk.\nThe dish is a vegetarian version of a meat curry, and it is delicious! I didnt want to take any home.\nOne of my most favourite dishes from Mauritius is the Vegetarian Mutton Curry Salad from Les Jardins de Sefou. I dont eat meat so I asked if they could make me this dish with lentils. Yes they could! So I tried it and it was amazing.\nThe dish is full of vegetables with no meat, but it works! I didnt notice the absence of meat at all. The curry mix is made of coconut milk, plus some spices and some lentils instead of meat.\nI also had this dish, the Vegetarian Mutton Curry Salad from Le Bistro. They have a vegetarian menu, which consists of Indian and Mauritian (Creole) foods. My favourite dishes on the menu are Mango Fondant, Creole Chicken Soup and the Vegetarian Mutton Curry Salad.\nI made my own homemade mutton curry in Mauritius and loved it! When I returned home, I was able to make my own version of Mauritius curry, and for the first time I could actually taste and compare my own home-made curry with a traditional one in Mauritius.\nMauritian Mutton Curry is a dish that combines a blend of potatoes, peppers, onions and mixed vegetables in which meat is substituted by pureed sweet potatoes and coconut milk which creates a smooth curry taste.\nYou can follow the instructions in the recipe but it is made using a similar method as other Indian dishes you may recognise. I found this recipe in an old Mauritian booklet and the instructions are not too difficult to follow. Of course everyone makes it differently.\nThe best way to serve this curry is to add boiled, hard-boiled or fried eggs, and I always use white ones. I make enough for a meal or a lunch, plus any extra can be reheated the next day, and I freeze what I dont eat.\nMauritian curry is an amazing dish and I recommend you try it on your holiday. I enjoyed making it and eating it. You can also find some Mauritian cuisine ingredients, including curry powder, in a supermarket.\nMy next post is about the dishes my daughter and I made at home.\nThank you to all who have read, commented and shared on my Mauritius posts.

For anyone who is interested in the science behind this process, check-out my previous posting on how the sun's light makes everything white or very bright, and everything else dark; which means that when you try and take a picture with a digital camera it will end up \"white\", or very bright, wherever light is present, and therefore \"dark\" where light is not present. The science of a digital camera is very simple like that. They are either very bright or very dark. There is no in-between.\nSo, I took two photos of the cloud-filled sun at the same time; one in color (red, green, blue = RGB), and one in black and white. Since film and most paper have a much greater range than digital sensors, the resulting two photos were printed on a color printer.\nBy printing them out, you get a much better view of the photographic moon I've chosen to name; because the image of the moon is simply the photographic \"highlight\" out of all of the very dark things I chose to include in my photo of the day, including the clouds and the sun's \"photographic\" appearance as it set into the clouds - which was truly magical to see live!\nAs you can see, the moon is only a minor detail in the larger (color) image of the sun, not a central object as that same moon seems to be in the photographic (black and white) image, in which you can clearly see what I've named \"the photographic moon\"...as it floats off into the morning, as the sun's last rays of light fade off and the moon is bathed once again in the red light of the sunrise!\nSo now, the photographic moon seems to be taking over and stealing everyone's attention away from the star in the middle of the picture - where the sun was, and everyone is looking up into the sky to see what's \"coming up\" that's bright this morning...which is where the moon is!\nI've learned two invaluable lessons today: one, that the sun's rays at sunset are a lot brighter than most people realize; and two, that the moon has the ability to give the impression that it is far more powerful and bright than it actually is, but people will still flock to it anyway and admire its apparent beauty.\nThe photographic moon's appearance is a reminder to all who see it to pay closer attention to the light around you as it becomes dimmer and dimmer, and never forget to go out dancing at least one single time while it's still bright: because it's not always going to be that bright!"

You can store your wooden table upside down if you want to make it easier to transport.\nA wooden table is also very difficult to paint and decorate. It can also stain easily because it is a porous material. If you are looking for the most durable option, then you probably shouldn't buy a wooden table. On the bright side, you don't have to worry about the legs breaking"

        "output": "Hi, I'm in the mood for a Bloody Mary. Can you give me a recipe for making one?\nMixed Bloody Mary: This drink is served as an \"as you like it\", so the only real rules are that the drink must be made with vodka and tomato juice. There are infinite recipes for mixed Bloody Marys, with every bartender on every bar creating their own special formula. Some use 80 proof vodka, some use the less potent 100 proof or even 150 proof. The \"secret\" of making a good Bloody Mary is to use the lightest possible vodka available to avoid a harsh finish. This is why some bartenders use vodka with fewer grains used for distillation. Of course, you should always taste before you drink to see if you like the flavor to your liking. To taste all three, start at the left and go clockwise around my drink display.\nVodka Bloody Mary: There is only one single ingredient in this drink, an 80 proof straight vodka. Some people use the 100 proof or 150 proof vodka, but the bartender's goal is to make sure the drink is not too heavy or strong. Some people choose to season the Bloody Mary with a few shakes of celery salt. Since this is the simplest of all drinks to make, there are no rules about when to use it unless you wish it for special occasions or just because you want to. It is traditionally served at Christmas time and at New Years in honor of 2010.\nDirty Martini: This drink calls for a very good quality olive oil, or even a fresh squeezed lemon juice, and some simple syrup or straight soda. This is the drink of choice when you want to drink something on the lighter side without sacrificing the flavor of good vodka. The bartender's goal is to make a drink as smooth as possible in order to allow the drinker to better appreciate the vodka. It's best made with a fresh squeezed lemon juice, but there is no hard and fast rule as to how these drinks should be made.\nKahlua and Cream: One of the most popular drinks in America, this drink combines a flavored coffee liqueur and heavy whipped cream to create a decadent treat. Some people choose to season the Kahlua with some light brown sugar. While some people consider the drink to be a \"morning\" drink, it can be enjoyed anytime. There is really no difference, except maybe some people prefer theirs with milk because it is similar to a coffee milk.\nA couple of days ago, my friend from high school who I have not seen in about ten years (yes, that long) stopped by to give me some gifts. He brought me a bottle of vodka and a bottle of the vodka flavored coffee liqueur in honor of Christmas and for my birthday. He also brought me some coffee. We drank some of the coffee and drank some drinks, including homemade Bloody Marys. For those who don't know, I am the barista at our local Starbucks, so I thought I would make a few variations of the drink to give to my friends.\nI used Kahlua instead of vodka because my friend brought me the coffee liqueur, which has a stronger coffee flavor, and for consistency. The other thing I wanted to do was take advantage of the holiday time and make a mix-in drink for New Year's Eve. A lot of people in our household are not huge alcohol drinkers, so this drink is a good way to have a little taste of alcohol without all the effects.\nAfter I had the right amount of alcohol in my drink, I added some of the Kahlua coffee whipped topping and then added some orange juice.\nWhen this was done, I topped it off with a cinnamon stick and some whipped cream.\nIf you want to have a taste or two of the holidays, but aren't as excited to down a big glass of booze, why not try out our homemade recipe? No mixers, no extra ingredients, just clean up with a little mix-in. It's the only way to celebrate the time of year.\nHow do you like to make your Bloody Mary? Let us know in the comments below."

I do think that those who choose to spread or scatter ashes on the beach also need to be aware of some of the natural risks to scattering and spreading of ashes. I do understand that this happens regularly due to the nature of the place however there are a few things that just need to be considered here, so that it can be done without any incident or issue. If you choose to have your ashes scattered at sea, you need to have some type of container in which your loved ones ashes are put.\nIt is a beautiful spot\nThat would be ideal for someone who couldn't have a big funeral\nMy husband passed, he was about 83. We were going to have a cremation and put the ashes in our son's casket. This was his choice. I didn't feel comfortable with that , I don't know if I'd be able to handle it. I decided against it. So we have his ashes in their special urn and it is on a shelf in our house. He was an Army vet so I couldn't have him go into a military cemetery. Because of that I had him cremated. I wasn't sure what he wanted for his ashes to do, so I took care of having them placed in our mausoleum where our daughter's ashes are. He did want his ashes to go to Mt. Airy and so I would have gladly had him scattered there, but I also felt better leaving his ashes in the mausoleum. This way we could all visit anytime we wanted. It took a little time for me to become accustomed to not having him around. It's been a year today and I still miss him.\nWe have him in our house also and I feel bad for not giving him better closure.\nA memorial is better than nothing\nHaving your ashes scattered is one way to have a final goodbye and to not worry about storing them. Instead you can have a final place where everyone can go and visit your ashes for a day or two or more.\nI do think that it's a much better option to have your ashes at home in a cemetery or a memorial. Having your ashes scattered here for all eternity is not a good idea because it's unregulated. When you're cremated, they send off your ashes into the wind and say that they can't be found. That means that your ashes will be scattered throughout the world over the years. The only thing you can do is hope that it doesn't rain and your ashes don't get washed into the sea. This is just crazy. It won't be found anywhere and who's going to know where your ashes are anyways except for a couple of people who you give them to? This place does this for the very obvious reason that they want you to pay them as much money as you can to have a service here in order to spread your ashes.\nThat's what I don't like about the whole thing. I don't want my ashes lost for 50 or 100 years. I want my family and friends to come up here and visit me at least one day a month if they can. I want to be able to be visited all the time by those I love.\nIf you are not a Christian I would advise against using this method of cremation. You"

        "output": "I've read the book \"The Twelve Caesars\" by Suetonius, a few times. I'm curious about the context, of when he wrote.\nSuetonius's \"The Twelve Caesars\" was probably published between 119 and 122.\nWhich is interesting, because of course it describes what was going on in 1st century Roman history, so even if he was writing it, why did he do it then and not before?\nWhat's his motivation?\nWas he trying to document the lives of the various Emperors, because he loved to tell dirty jokes about it, or was he actually trying to influence future Romans to take a more \"pro-rebellion\" (or whatever) stand during the reign of the emperor who Suetonius was writing for, or why?\nIf he was just doing it to document history, then in all his time since 1st century Rome was gone and he certainly didn't seem to think he was writing a book that would be taken seriously, as he didn't even give his book a title.\nSo what is his actual motivation for writing it? Because I'm guessing it was about more than just making dirty, funny stories to make people laugh.\nSuetonius, at the time, was probably a part of history, or politics, or something since he worked for the current Emperor, but now it's clear he was trying to write down a reference for historians who would come along after him, and he couldn't even do that because in 500 years, when he was dead, there were already too many new authors. The only way one of his books would be remembered in 500 years was if he had been writing down some of the dirty history he had inside his head, which he was.\nSo were these 10 other authors in Rome in 500 CE, really there when he was writing?\nWas he trying to make new history?\nOr was he trying to make a set of funny stories that were true?\nBecause it's obvious he'd done research, and not just read stuff off of a Google page, so he knew most of those things wouldn't have made sense to anyone reading them 2000 years ago, but to do research on the Roman Empire and its history, he would have had to see many things, and read books that were thousands of years old.\nAnd yet.... the things he said would seem, to us, to be made up or, at best, exaggerated, but at the very least these 10 other authors would have had access to these things, would have gotten the stories from him, would have seen his letters or something, but they just picked and chose the best stories that would fit with their beliefs about how the world works.\nAnd then, they, like Suetonius, wrote the stories down, and passed them on. And we think these stories aren't true because everyone agrees everyone else was just making it all up.\nThat's a fascinating idea, really.\nBut then, would they have told the good stories, or the fun stories, or the funny ones, and what about their sources?\nI would like to read even a little bit more about it, but I've read it, and as far as I can tell, it's about these 12 dead leaders, who did these things, that weren't all documented by anybody. I think it's about that.\nI can get behind that.\nHere's what happens, though. I can understand why it would be important to have a set of stories to teach kids. If you know the history and how to live right in the Roman world, and you know your parents are dead and you're being raised by a new family, your new step-family won't know these things, and, because they see you as a guest on theirs, it would be a big deal to get you to change your mind about some important \"family\" things, and you're living in a different world.\nSo you've got a group of stories, and other stories, and you don't know what's true and what's not true and you don't know what's important and what's not. So you can make up your own stories to try to keep order in your life until you figure out how to live. How you start out believing that Nero should be on the throne and then that Augustus shouldn't even exist because he didn't seem to be doing anything in particular, and you try to explain why you think it should be Augustus's brother Tiberius.\nAnd you write the stories down, and then they keep adding another 10 writers, to make the book bigger, because that's more important than the real thing, and they'"

Is it fair to ask party members to vote in opposition to their own ideals when voting on a particular issue? Or is it only fair to ask voters to vote with their ideology on election day? As you will see, these questions raise many others and they are among the issues of the day, as both parties make \"compromise\" or \"bargains\" on major issues.\n\nIn the United States, we all have a stake in the outcome of the next election; we all have a stake in the future of our children and our grandchildren. The only way to change matters is to take action. The first step is to become informed. We hope that this section has helped to accomplish that goal.\n\n### 5.7.2 The First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech\n\nIn 1789, the United States became a new nation with a Constitution. Under the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech was guaranteed. But there was no freedom to advocate the establishment of a certain religion or to advocate that people of certain races, religions, or national origins should not be able to vote for the President. Under the First Amendment of the Constitution, Americans have the right to speak freely about everything.\n\nThis right, of course, can be abused. Thus, free speech can be restricted for the sake of public safety, for example, to prevent the use of foul language, vulgar posters, or pornography on a highway billboard. These posters could be seen by children and teens or by motorists. Thus, we see limits to First Amendment rights on public highways. But private places, such as homes, places of worship, and schools, remain free of such restrictions.\n\nHow does this principle apply, then, to our ability to speak, write, or even demonstrate in support or in opposition to a particular candidate or issue? To be sure, the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights is a \"blank check\" to all the American people. It is what we make of the freedom of speech, and every other right, that will determine the future.\n\nIt is important to note also that the First Amendment is a limitation on the power of government, not on what people may say when they address each other in social situations such as a classroom, when they speak to their Congresspeople, or when they address a political rally or a political group. If you use your First Amendment rights, remember to do so with your best judgment. In this book, we have tried to offer up-to-date, responsible, and factual guidance. We do not mean to be critical of anyone who uses the First Amendment right of free speech. But we do mean to make you think about how best to exercise that right.\n\n### 5.7.3 Can Government Regulation Limit the First Amendment?\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution is simple. It says, in part: \"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...\" This means that government can no more restrict freedom of speech than can a private citizen.\n\nOf course, the First Amendment does not promise \"absolute\" freedom of speech. The government has the authority to protect people from threats and crime, including child molesters and white supremacists. It's just that such restrictions are not meant to take away our rights of speech or of free press.\n\nSo what is one of the things that the government cannot do regarding freedom of the press? Well, it certainly cannot \"abridge\" that press any more than it can abridge a person's rights of free speech. The government cannot \"abridge\" anyone's rights to free speech or press.\n\nBut what about banning speech related to politics? For example, it has been illegal in the United States for more than two centuries for anyone to \"bribe\" a federal official. But what about trying to \"bribe\" a congressional official in an attempt to influence his or her vote? Can someone be \"bribed\" if that someone promises another person something in exchange for voting a certain way on an issue?

Serial killers are still at large in New York, California, Philadelphia and other big cities throughout the U.S.\nA serial killer is the same thing as a spree killer with multiple victims over a period of time and a spree killer may or may not be a serial killer. The term “serial killer” was coined in the late 1970s, but before serial killers were a regular on America’s nightly news, there were several high-profile cases that caught attention across the nation and abroad.\nIn the following list of serial killers, one of these evil men and women (for we can’t really say they are men and they aren’t women), committed horrible crimes that we remember all these years later. However, their evil was so horrific that they got off scot-free in the 70s and 80s.\nHere, in chronological order, are some of the most infamous serial killers from decades gone by.\nJohn Herbert Delly- New Jersey\nBorn in 1940 and a native of Passaic, New Jersey, John Herbert Delury is one of the least understood, but most prolific serial killers in United States history.\nHis first victim was an 11-year-old girl, who was strangled to death on February 15, 1960.\nPolice later found human remains in five New Jersey graves, one of which included the body of a 7-year-old girl.\nHowever, he was never convicted of a crime until 2006 when he confessed to seven murders, but could only prove three of them, including that of his third child in 1971.\nHe was sentenced to death in one of the most brutal killings of the 70s.\nTommy Lynn Sells- Texas\nTommy Lynn Sells was one of the most dangerous serial killers in the 70s and 80s. The 61-year-old man was killed in 2014 after a long-lasting prison sentence in the 28 states that he was tried in.\nFrom 1775 to his death on March 5, 2014, and the first serial killings committed in a state after DNA was used to convict him, Sells claimed responsibility in 100 murders.\nSells was convicted and sentenced to death for the torture-infested murder of 16-year-old April Tinsley in 1999 of a city in northeastern Texas.\nHe’s been one of the most notorious criminal minds on record, as his body contained at least five different blood types: O+, A, AB, B, and B+.\nSerial killers always tend to use different weapons and different methods of torture, and when combined with this DNA blood type, it would have made the task of tracing him to his victims almost impossible.\nTommy Sells was executed in Huntsville, Texas, on March 5, 2014.\nRichard Ramirez- San Francisco\nRichard Ramirez was raised by his mother and stepfather from an early age in California. However, things started to get bad for him when he turned to a life of crime at the age of 11.\nLater, he spent 18 days behind bars for a sexual assault.\nRamirez was known as the “Gut-Grinder”, as his trademark was slicing open his victims from their stomachs upwards.\nThis was the case after he was caught in 1985 in a string of eleven crimes.\nHe targeted the elderly and was said to have killed twelve people, raped more, and committed sixty robberies.\nThis made him one of the most notorious 70s serial killers, and he was sentenced to death in 1989.\nCharles Starkweather- Wyoming\nCharles Starkweather was a Nebraska-born killer who went on a killing spree on a date with his 14-year-old girlfriend and her mother in 1958.

Apples\n\n### Apple 101 with Your Food Guide Pyramid\n\nApples ( _Malus pumila_ ) are considered an \"A\" food, which means that they make a very important contribution to a healthy diet. The US Department of Agriculture's food pyramid classifies all fruits as one of the three A's: \"apples,\" \"avocados,\" or \"apricots.\"\n\nTo the naked eye, apples look pretty similar, with few differences in their outer appearance, appearance, and taste, but when it comes to nutrition—and specifically vitamins and minerals—they actually differ quite dramatically. Even a few minor changes in how an apple is grown, such as pesticide levels or water management, can significantly reduce the nutritional value of the fruit. This is especially important with an expensive staple of the American diet such as apples, which are an excellent source of many vitamins and minerals. You'd be disappointed if you were to simply peel and eat an apple, because its nutrition profile is pretty much the same as that of peeling an apple. The peeling of fresh apples releases 40 percent of the vitamins A, B, and C that you'd otherwise be getting from eating the whole fruit as well as minerals such as iron, zinc, and potassium that you'd be losing by peeling the apple.\n\nA 3.5 ounce (100 gram) serving of apple juice contains about 16 percent of the daily value of vitamins A, C, and E. This apple juice also contains about 15 percent of your daily recommended value of folate, potassium, and magnesium.\n\nIf the 3.5 ounce (100 gram) serving of apple juice doesn't seem like much, that's good; only one serving and you're done! But on the other hand, it also means that there's a limited amount of nutrients to consider when we're making juice. We'll talk more about how much this matters later in the chapter, but for now, just be aware that this one serving of juice has a pretty limited nutritional value.\n\nTo get the full nutritional value from apples, consume the whole fruit. Eating apples whole is the ideal way to eat a healthy apple. This applies to other fruits as well and is good advice wherever possible.\n\n### What Are Apples Made Of?\n\nApples fall into the group of pungent fruits, but each individual apple can have a slightly different taste, depending on where it comes from, since each area in the world has its own version of what an apple should taste like. This is not usually the case, though, since pungency is often a by-product of pesticides. In modern times, pungency is generally considered a problem that may result in lower consumption (and therefore lower sales) of the fruits in question. So the apple in a supermarket is pretty much the same no matter where you look—and in terms of nutrients, it may be a whole lot like a watery apple, too.\n\nThe main components of any apples are water, glucose, and fructose (sweet carbohydrates). Apples also contain phytosterols, including alpha-tocopherol, a vitamin E analog that is the most abundant form of tocopherol in plants and one of only two biochemically active forms in the human diet.

The substance dissolved is not affected by a\n What is the solvent chemical?\nWhat is a gas solute in chemistry? \nHow do you dissolve solid in a chemical reaction?\nDissolving is an important aspect of chemical reactions and one that is not always well understood. Here, we provide an overview of how to prepare chemically-reactive solids for a variety of uses.\nCan you make a solution without a solvent?\nNo, to complete a reaction in a solvent, you must have enough solvent to get your reaction to go to completion.\nHow is a solution made in a lab?\nIn order to make a solution, two basic elements are required: one or more solvents and a solute. The solvents in the solution are often chosen to be non-polar solvents, which have a relatively low boiling point, while the solute is typically dissolved in a liquid solvent that has a boiling point above the boiling point of the solvent. In a lab, the solvents available are usually used as either a dilution or as a concentrated solution. Most chemical reactions require a solvent for use as a solvent.\nWhat is a chemical reaction in a solution?\nIn a chemical reaction, two or more substances are involved in a reaction. In a solution, the substances are mixed. The two substances in the solution must be dissolving to make a solution in the same ratio.\n How is a solute dissolved in a solvent?\nSolution in solid state. A solid solution can be created in a solid state. The solvent needs to be dissolved into the solid. The solvent must be soluble to the solid.\nHow much acid does it take to dissolve one part of a solid?\nMost solvents are weak acids and only weakly dissolve in water. The majority of weak acids have a pH of about 5 to 10. The acid is weak and the amount of acid needed to dissolve one part of a solid is not fixed and can vary dramatically.\nHow many times does a gas dissolve in liquids?\nThe solution is a gas that can occur in a liquid or one part of a solid. The liquid or solid can be dissolved into a gas. It is difficult to determine how many times a gas dissolves into liquid because the gas solution is a gas and a solution is a liquid or a solid. It is difficult to find the number of times a gas is dissolved into liquid or a solid because the solution is an unknown gas that can be in liquid or a solid. It is a gas that can occur in a liquid or one part of a solid.\nHow many times does a solid dissolve in liquid?\nThe solution is a substance that consists of one or more different solutethe concentration of a solution is the amount of solute dissolved in an unknown amount of solution. A solution that is a solid solution is a solution that consists of one solute that has one or more different solutes. A solution is not a liquid solution but is a mixture of two or more soluble compounds.\nWhat is the concentration of solution?\nIn a solution, the concentration of the solute is the amount of substances dissolved in the solution.\nWhat is the difference between concentration and solution?\nA solution is a mixture of two or more soluble compounds that reacts with water to form a solution called a hydroxide. The solution can also be composed of one or more different solutions. A solution is not a solution because there are one or more soluble compounds that react with water. The solution is not a solution unless it contains one or more soluble compounds.\nWhen is solution not a solution?\nA solvent can be a liquid or a solid.

How did that effect make our Ice Cream Water change state?\nWhat is going on with the Ice Cream Water now that it has changed and what should we do with it?\nHow does the change from liquation to solidification and vaporization change the substance?\nHave them go outside and get sticks for their “ice cubes” or have them cut squares of paper from a notebook for their “ice cubes.” This step requires a bit of planning on the parents’ part, unless it is an open-ended exploration.\nAfter the stick/paper squares are made, have the children hold them under the faucet and turn on the water in their sink. Tell them to be careful: their water is hot, and they are going to test its temperature.\nWhat temperature does their water have on the outside?\nWhat temperature does their water have inside?\nHow does their water change when their hands get wet enough to make hand prints on an open window, the inside of a closet, a kitchen drawer, or any other “cold” surface that children choose to discover?\nAs the experiment progresses, check in periodically with your children. Do they understand why the water is changing state?\nHow did you know if the water was at a certain temperature? Did it feel wet?\nWhat do you think will happen to your water outside?\nCan water change state if it is too cold?\nLet your children take over for a while. Do some simple writing or art related to what they have been learning.\nIce cream is fun for all of us, but making ice cream in the summer, freezing a yogurt to change state, creating a cool splash in the bath, and using a cold container to change a substance’s state are all important scientific concepts that we can explore together to see nature and observe nature for what it is!\nWe need to let our children be curious and let them explore nature without fear. It will take little patience and a lot of fun. That is exactly what our children deserve.\nYou can find more experiments like this in the next book we will discuss, “Why Things Fly.” And, if you've got a favorite science book, tell"

        "output": "Can you tell me a very easy to way clean a showerhead? Also, I cannot turn on the shower hot so it is pretty much useless. Please Help!\nHave you checked the thermostat for your hot water heater? If it needs to be repaired, you can call a plumber.\nA showerhead that is not working can sometimes be repaired. You should be able to do it yourself, though you must first figure out what type of showerhead you have. If possible, take the showerhead off and see what type it is.\nIf you are unable to do that or you are not sure, call a plumber who will be able to help you determine what needs to be done.\nIs the water in your home hard or soft? If it's hard, it means that there is a lot of calcium and magnesium in the water your plumbing. That water may have a hard time getting through the showerhead and you'd end up with cloudy water.\nIf you are also experiencing water stains on your walls, this could be due to hard water.\nYou have to have hard water removed and you can do so by using a filter. This may require you to buy additional showerhead but you should be fine.\nDo you know if you are paying for the water coming in you home or just only what you are using? You may have a problem with the former.\nIf that is the case and your plumber has installed the whole house filter and you still have a non-working showerhead, he should be able to repair it for you.\nA showerhead should have been installed in your home if you are a homeowner. However, it's not impossible to install a showerhead yourself. You would need to purchase a kit and that will come along with a manual. The manual should tell you which tools are required and they are easy to find.\nIt's important you do not cut corners if you are going to replace the showerhead yourself because you can easily put too much tension in the showerhead and it can break on the hanger.\nBefore you fix the showerhead, turn off the power to it and remove it. Then, pull out the old hanger, put in a new one and put everything back together.\nIt's a pretty easy job but if you feel awkward, then you can call a plumber for assistance.\nYou can also check the pressure switch on your showerhead to see if it's working. If it's not a problem, it could be either the water heater or the pressure switch.\nYou could also check the thermostat for your water heater and if that's not the problem, call your plumber to check it out.\nYou only require a special plier in order to unclog it.\nThe thing you need to know before you do that is to ensure that you are unclogging the internal part of your showerhead. In order to do so, you will need a long, thin plier and you have to twist it into the pipe itself.\nThere may come a time when you must take apart the whole showerhead and replace the parts or the whole showerhead. If you are going to purchase a new showerhead though, make sure the parts or material are certified for use in a domestic environment.\nThis way, you will also be safe from toxic chemicals being used in the production process.\nThere is no need to replace the showerhead you have currently, for something more fancy. You must first have a look at whether or not the showerhead you currently have is functioning. If it is, it's safe to keep using it.\nHowever, if you want to find a better one, you can always look for one that has a dual sprayer and that can even make the shower look nice for your bathroom. If it does this, you might as well keep using it and if not, you can get a new one.\nIf you cannot take apart your showerhead to clean it, try spraying the showerhead with a 50/50 mix of vinegar and water, to see if you can clean it. You should also inspect the water pressure hose with your cleaning tools.\nYou should also use a scrub brush to clean the showerhead in an attempt to get things working again. If this is a shower head that is made of aluminum, or brass, then you could clean it with a cotton swab as well.\nFinally, you should spray a toothpaste onto your showerhead, and brush it for at least fifteen minutes. This should help clean and grease it for it to function again.\nAlso, if you do not prefer cleaning your showerhead from home, you can always have it cleaned by a professional.\nWhen you're not using it, you can turn off your showerhead. You can always turn it on just before getting inside your shower so the steam will not be there.\nIf yours is still not working despite how you"

Cut the meat into cubes. Leave only the fat on the bell peppers, keep the rind and seeds.\n2. Wash and dry the onion.\n3. Wash the vegetables and cut the rind off each pepper, making sure that you don´t separate the seeds.\n4. Put the onion and 8 cups of water in a large pot. Add the meat and the bell peppers. Cover.\n5. Cook a little and when the soup mixture becomes a little fizz, remove the solid part with a sieve to avoid lumps.\n6. Return the onion and 8 cups of water to the pot. Cut only the rind off the onion, but you may keep the seeds. Cover.\n7. Cook another 2 hours.\n8. Stir the vegetables and spices, including the cilantro and serve with plain white rice.\nVicedi should taste sour.\nFor other recipes, I can recommend some books, that were helpful for me.\n1. Latin American Recipes\nBy A.M. Toulouse\nThere are some great Latin American recipes. This is one of my favorite recipes and it has been there since the very beginning.\nI have always bought this book when I am in Uruguay.\nI believe every big local supermarket is selling it.\n2. Comida y bebida criollas del Uruguay\nBy Elba Alegreti\nIt is a book by Elba Alegreti, who is a well-known Uruguayan chef. She has traveled a lot in Latin America and published several books with recipes from many different countries. This one was a wonderful surprise. It has some Uruguay recipes, but also a lot of Ecuadorian recipes.\nIt is a kind of coffee table book. It is a beautiful thing. She has a lot of knowledge as a cook. It is a small book with 105 pages and includes lots of photos. If you are visiting Uruguay, this is a must in your bag!\nI hope that these two recipes will be of some help to you.\nThe rest we need to chat on WhatsApp, if you are so inclined.\nPura Vida from Montevideo\nWhat is the most expensive city in Uruguay to live? What are some of the most popular dishes in Uruguay?\nI'm so happy that you've written to me again, Fernando!\nI am so glad that you liked the recipe for Vicedi. I was looking for it for a long time myself because I grew up eating it. My parents used to live in Colonia, which is by the river. During the 60s and 70s it was full of Italians and other Italians from the nearby countries that started coming to Uruguay after WWII. When we were young, my mother used to tell us the story about how my father used to live with other Italian immigrants in a house with 9 other families. That was the origin of Vicedi. All of them used to come up with a few of their own recipes, which included the Vicedi dish. During the 80s, many Italian descendants left to Argentina after the Uruguay-Argentine dispute, and with them went most of the recipes.\nWhen I was young, I grew up in Montevideo. My mother"

        "output": "Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet. How do I house, feed, and otherwise care for it?\nThere are many reasons why the rat is a popular pet: it's more affordable than dogs and cats, it's tiny so it can live in houses, they're cute as a button, it's not a big commitment in terms of time or money, it's very clean (for a critter, anyway), and it's very intelligent.\nHere are some resources to help you be a happy, healthy Rat Dad.\nRats are very clean animals. For this reason, you'll want to ensure you're cleaning your rat's cage and environment regularly.\nCheck out this great video on how to clean your rat's cage!\nRats can smell their cage for weeks, even a month after cleaning it. So what do you need in your bathtub?\nWe're sure it's probably not an emergency that the drain is blocked. But if something is a little off, don't just try to solve it by yourself.\n\"The best way to get help is usually to ask people who've done what you're planning for yourself.\"\nIf you keep your rat outside, make sure it's a safe and easy place to access.\nBut if you keep your rat indoors, you'll need a cage for the entire time you have her (they need to keep running to avoid repetitive stress injuries (RSIs)) It's best to have a large cage so your rat can get about, explore, and not feel stifled, but you can always cage-trap it.\nIt's important to note that it's illegal to sell cage-traps, and since most people who have pet rats do so due to their size, it is recommended that you use a cage trap in conjunction with a large cage.\nTo be safe, make sure your rat can't get out by digging its way.\n\"Bathroom\" is an awesome place to keep a pet if you don't have much room.\nA rat will need to have 300-400g of food a day (2-3 tablespoons of food). However, you probably can't afford to buy all of your food at once.\nTo avoid this, buy in as little as possible, store it for later, and then use what was previously purchased.\nIt's important to note that rats can get very sensitive to foods you've stored for a long while, and if you find your rat is getting hungry despite having food, give it fresh food while giving it old food the following day.\nRats get bored easily (which is part of what makes them so intelligent).\nAs a result, it's important to play with your rat regularly.\nHowever, try not to go overboard and overdo it. If you overdo it, it may become anxious or stressed.\nIf you haven't seen what the average rat looks like, you'll be astounded by the number of colors rats come in.\nIf you live in a warm area, a rat (rat) could use a small amount of water in your bathtub daily.\nIf you live in a cold area, you should have a pet water bottle and feed water to your rat each meal.\nRats have a lot more on their plates than you think. There are a lot of people who could benefit from reading more about them, so we hope that this article will do just that."

It was short, but I still remembered it a whole year later. The rest of the games were all short, but had a lot of fun moments in them.\nI remember spending a good part of my playtime on \"Coral Island\", which was a survival game. It was nice, a guy named David Robinson was the lead developer of it, and one of my favorite songs ever was in the game. The music was by Danny Elfman, and the song was \"The Island\". Even though it's a short track, about 4 minutes, it's one of the most epic and beautiful songs I've ever heard. I liked the game a lot, but not enough to go out and buy it. I guess by the time I was 10 I didn't have that kind of money.\nI remember playing \"The Simpsons: The Video Game\" on my Xbox. Not what you think, it was a point-n-click styled game. It came out not long after I first bought the Xbox. I thought it was pretty funny, I liked the humor, but it was the same way I felt about \"The Curse of Monkey Island.\" I thought it was a funny, not to mention awesome, video game. If not for these games, I might not have been so into The Muppets as I still am. Or even into The Simpsons as much.\nI also bought both \"The Simpsons: Road Rage\" and \"The Simpsons: Hit & Run\" for the GameCube. Both games were fun and awesome. Road Rage was a road rally game, and Hit & Run had a lot of driving, but it also had other things. Like a story where Krusty is a stunt car driver for a movie, and he has an old school car chained to a tree and his team breaks the restraints free using dynamite and launches him up a hill. It was really cool, there was a lot of crazy stuff, and a lot of great music too. I especially liked the music.\nOne of my favorite Simpsons games that I've mentioned, and probably one of my top 2 favorite video games ever, is \"Sonic Mega Collection\" for the GameCube. It was awesome, and I loved it. I used to play it all the time. It had a game that came out before we got any Sonic games, \"Sonic Triple Trouble\", and after we got Sonic in the U.S. I loved that game. It was a bit harder than it should've been. \"Sonic Revolution\" on the Gamecube was pretty easy, but had good music, so I loved playing it. I remember playing both on the Gamecube and the Xbox. I've played a ton of awesome old Sonic games, \"Sonic 1\" to \"Sonic 4\", when I was growing up.\n\"Sonic Mega Collection\" had a ton of Sonic games, and it wasn't just Sonic. It had all of Sonic's friends games, like \"Sonic Spinball\", \"Tails' Sky Patrol\", and all of his sprite-based friends, namely Knuckles, Amy, Tails, and Eggman. That was another thing, \"Sonic Mega Collection\" was awesome. It had not just games, but the original Sonic theme songs and all of the cut scenes from all of the games. It was AWESOME!\nOne of my favorite video games on this list is \"Mario Power Tennis\" for the Gamecube. It was fun, but not only that. It came with 2-Player mode and Arcade mode, making it almost like 3 games in 1. 2-Player mode is just like 2 players in a game of tennis against the computer. Arcade mode is just one player with 1 opponent in the computer, and is like a story or tournament mode. It was a really fun game, but what made it so good was in the 2-Player mode. Once you beat 1 opponent in the computer you could play their character again as a different character. So you might have 3 characters in your game to play against, and it kept going until you lost. The 2-Player mode had this great game of \"Fuel\" where it was like a volleyball game. Instead of only hitting the ball to the other side, you had to hit it into the middle of the court and then as much as you can. It got a lot tougher towards the middle, but it was really fun.\nI bought \"The Simpsons: Hit & Run\" for the Xbox, that was a real cool game too. One thing I didn"

        "output": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Argentinian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Milanesa de peceto? I've heard it's a pretty standard dish that all Argentinians know how to make?\nI know the chicken would taste better, but pork would be easier for me to buy.\nI tried a milanesa like this a few months ago, just made from a sirloin. It turned out very well. This version was so much better than the sirloin one. I definitely will make this again. I also love your tips for making the crust.\nAlso, thanks for the reminder to brush the frying pan with oil. I usually just spray with Pam and skip the oil.\nI love this recipe! I was so glad to get it from one of your previous posts, because now I can make it the same way with my cast iron skillet. I haven't made it for a while but will definitely be making it again this week.\nI am making milanesa as part of an Argentinian dinner, on Sunday. I'll have to make a double batch, though, since I'm feeding close to 50 (and they will all want milanesa or some other type of steak), and I don't have cast iron skillets. A sirloin works great for milanesa, since it is easy to cut into thin steaks. Here's another milanesa recipe, this one is for steak, made exactly like the regular milanesa: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/06/argentine-milanesa-steak-breaded-ground-beef-onion-egg-olives-tomato-garlic-bread-pane-bucato-pepper.html .\nOne tip- for a crispy crust, don't use a fry pan; don't believe the old \"it's got a high heat, it must be ok if the pan is burning.\" The frying process needs to start with some fat on the pan before it can stick anything to it. A cast iron pan is ideal- you will get the best crispy crust when you start with some oil, then add more oil to a depth that is deep enough for the meat and breadcrumbs. The pan must contain the meat in a layer no thicker than an average slice of bread- otherwise, you won't get the crispy crust. Also, since you aren't making a real fried steak, you'll have to get your breadcrumbs really hot- put them in a shallow pan and place in a 425 degree oven for about 15 minutes or so.\nThis was great! I made it for a school night and everyone was so surprised to find good home cooking. It was also fast enough to make ahead and put in the freezer. My only complaint is that I used 85/15 ground beef, which is a bit too lean for me, so I will definitely make it with leaner meat next time.\nWow. Great job. I only make this type of thing once in a while and I always get compliments. I will be making it for my family for Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks. The ingredients list says to cut the beef into \"steaks\" but I can't find that phrase in the actual recipe.\nExcellent, excellent recipe! The kids loved it, and even managed to eat with their hands. It was very easy, and you had the whole pack ready in a little over an hour. We used lean ground steak - as noted by many others. I'm curious if you happen to know the difference between the 85/15 ground beef and the ground sirloin used by the supermarket?\nMy family really liked this dish. While we were cooking it I suggested it as a good first step if anyone wanted to become a more competent cook. I think the only change I'd make is to use a little more oregano, perhaps double the amount here. My family and I all thought it had a slight spicy aftertaste that we liked.\nI think there's no better kind of cookbook to have lying around in any kitchen than Spanish ones. They're wonderful for the basics. And while I don't have a full list of recipes for milanesas, this one was very similar to a couple in my copy. I made it into little bites, and the kids loved it. Served it with arugula as a side salad. You can't go wrong.\nOne question though. I had some trouble making the dough. In the recipe, it talks about flour and milk, but if you"

        "output": "I have my grandfather's antique fountain pen and a bottle of ink, but have never done this before. Can you tell me how to refill the fountain pen? And what kind of ink should I buy?\"\n\nHe handed the man a paper and asked a few questions, such as where he grew up and how he became a professional. Then he handed him the pen.\n\nThe man carefully wrote down the words. He turned around and bowed, then left.\n\nThe man returned the following day.\n\n\"Yesterday's message has led me to believe that you had a good life in your family,\" the Master said. \"But on that day you were very upset after your wife left. This has made your personality unstable. I have one question for you: What was your first name?\"\n\nThe man said, \"I am called Wang Jin.\"\n\n\"Okay. So I'll ask you a final question as a professional: Will you ever remarry?\"\n\n\"I have not decided.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nThe man then left the office and never came back. A few months later the Master died. No one really knew what had happened to the man during those months.\n\nThe following autumn an apprentice named Fan discovered the Master's dead body in the master-apprentice classroom.\n\nPeople from the Master's sect, including his student Li, who had already become a famous scholar, helped his family prepare a funeral. When Li was preparing to offer up the Master's corpse to fire, however, it started to move by itself. It had fallen on its stomach and was now facing its head had been turned sideways.\n\n\"Look, Master's head has fallen over,\" Fan said. \"We can't offer it up to fire if that is what happened to his head.\"\n\nBut Li did not listen to his apprentice and held the Master's head as it began to melt before his eyes.\n\n\"See that?\" Li said. \"I saw the Master's head fall over while offering it up to fire, but he was already dead and couldn't have felt it. It fell over as he went to heaven.\"\n\nFan said, \"If that's true, that dead man is a deity.\"\n\nHis remark caused Li to lose his composure, but in his eyes there was fear and respect.\n\nSome time later, Fan had a very strange dream. It seemed that his grandfather had invited him into his house to sit down.\n\n\"Did you send a letter to Fan?\" Fan's grandfather asked him directly.\n\n\"Yes, to that town in Shandong province.\"\n\n\"I wrote and asked you to go find a dead man who turned in the letter for me in order to find out what he wanted,\" Fan was a little confused, as the dream seemed to confuse reality.\n\n\"What he wants is not money,\" Fan's grandfather said. \"Even if there was money, I would have given it to him. But those who want money only want to cheat others from their money. But if you give him the money first, as it were, it simply won't work. They do not have the ability to cheat you. So you must not have given him money and give it to me instead.\"\n\nFan knew that his grandfather was dead and started to feel something like cold dread in his heart. What was this all about?\n\nThen his grandfather took out some money and began to count them.\n\n\"This money was mine,\" he said. \"That man was the Master. You see, he knew that you would not give him money even though he had asked you. So he wanted to go to you instead. However, just as you were unable to give him money, I could not give you my money. And so he was determined to send you to Heaven.\n\n\"He wanted to make you an example of humility so that others would realize that they must follow him. Because you are a good hearted man, I can come and ask you about your dream. This was my only way to communicate with you.\"\n\nHe then turned his face aside to show he was crying.\n\nFan woke up.\n\nIn the evening, the other disciples asked Fan, \"Why didn't you give him the money he asked for? Even if he didn't want it, it was his letter we took.\"\n\nFan said nothing.\n\nThe other disciples thought he'd fallen ill or been possessed by a spirit.\n\nFan's sister came to see him the next day and was very worried. She'd been going to school nearby with him, and she began to cry. \"You are my younger brother; how can you do this? To think that you still haven't given"

In other words, the more we can say, \"Hey, let me tell you what it's going to take, and if you do all the things, then you have a great opportunity.\"\nAnd that kind of attitude is really what you want, I think, as your approach.\nIt is. I appreciate that advice, thank you.\nWhen you look at your products, do you try and sell something that no one else can sell?\nI don't think that way. I think about the things that we need to solve. When we first started, it was in fact a way of solving a problem. We've got this great tool that makes people love to do things, and then the next problem that we solved was marketing problems. In the early days it really was a small group of companies who would invite us in. It was companies like IBM, United Airlines, Marriott and AT&T, and it was a small group. Now we're going into a market that's totally new to us, so we decided to do that with new tools.\nNow we're going to offer them to everyone. And my challenge to my team over the last 10 years has been to try to come up with the kind of tool that we might find for ourselves that we could create with a lot of other sellers like us. That's what we've tried to do is to create the tools in such a way that you could just point and click and say, \"This really isn't a selling problem. This is a training problem. Okay, do you want to talk more about these five tools?\"\nWell, that's great. Do you think you'll move into online selling?\nYes, I do. Yes.\nYou must feel quite different from the early days of Vistage.\nYes. We changed the name from Vistage to the Vistage Group. And for me that was sort of a symbolic turning of the page as far as the old ways of doing things. We actually have a new website coming out. It's called www.vistageselling.com. We've got an online tool that lets you get to a live member, which is very helpful.\nI do think that there's a lot of benefits to having a member, so we're going to be really aggressive to try to say: \"We know how hard it is to do this and build a relationship.\" And that's the thing, you do. It isn't like having a product. You have to build a relationship.\nThis is so important because we're so used to having products that we can buy, we can see, but a relationship and trust is incredibly important. I appreciate you talking about that as well."

        "output": "Hi, I'd like to learn how to play racquetball. Can you explain the game to me?\nRacquetball is a fast paced game for two people. One begins the game and plays until he/she is forced to retire in a game of short 30-second points.\nAll positions are made with the racket side facing the other person. If at any point in the rally the ball hits the player on his side of the court, he loses the point and is forced to retire. If the opponent misses the ball with his own racket the ball is returned by the receiver.\nIt is a very physical game where there are many different ways of playing.\nWhat equipment do I need to play racquetball?\nIn order to play a game of racquetball you need to have a racquetball, a player's helmet, racquetball shoes and a game schedule.\nWhat kind of shoes should I wear for racquetball?\nWhen playing racquetball, players wear racquetball shoes for increased mobility. Racquetball is a very quick game, and if you do not have the right footwear, you may cause yourself an injury. If you see a player in the gym with high boots and long shorts, you know that they know how to play racquetball.\nHow many games of racquetball are played in a tournament?\nIn a tournament, there will be a set number of games played depending on the age group. The number of games will be determined by the size of the tournament, and most of them will be best two out of three games. In some tournaments, games must be completed within a certain time frame, meaning that one player may not receive enough chances to win a game.\nWhat kind of positions are used in a game of racquetball?\nThere are many positions used in racquetball, and it all depends on how you want to play. If you are playing the sport for the first time, we suggest that you start off using a backhand. This is because of its ease and is a very simple position, so you will not have to have to think as much. You can switch this position in and out as you get more comfortable with playing the sport. If you are going to play singles you need to play a backhand most of the time. In team racquetball you need to try to take the ball all the way down the court and play an open court racquetball.\n1. To hit the ball with your racquet side to racquetball player.\n2. If you miss the ball with your racquet, it is played back by your opponent.\n3.

        "instruction": "Hi, I'd like to learn to bake challah. Can you give me a recipe for that?",
        "output": "Hi, I'd like to learn to bake challah. Can you give me a recipe for that?\"\nA: To get that question out in the open, because I don't want to give it to the readers, I'm going to go ahead and start my answer today. I'm going to tell them a story. It goes like this: My mother asked me to make challah. I did it; I made it, and what happened is, when I handed it over to her and she was about to put it back in the oven she started crying; she was choked up - I wasn't really aware or even prepared to make this story come out - and she said, \"My challah is not that it is.\" I looked at her and said, \"Mommy, I made it for you. I worked on that dough. I got the butter out of the fridge, I got the water that's hot out of the burner, I got the flour ready to knead, and I kneaded it for you.\"\nHow many of you used to make challah because it was fun? How many of you were doing it for the parents? How many of you found it to be a real labor of love? It was just one more thing to do; \"But Mom, all right, I'll do that.\" In fact, one of the things that I hear from a lot of people and from a lot of mothers about children, \"I say let him do it, but I am scared that he is going to get hurt,\" and I often see little boys on the kitchen counters standing on the chairs. I used to do it when I was a child, too, but let me tell you, I never made my mother come to the kitchen because her challah didn't turn out the right way. In fact, there was this one time that I remember when my mother went to make challah, and it turned out to be so hard that her finger got stuck inside of it when she was pulling a part of it out.\nA: No one asked me to come in because of that. My father used to say, \"You don't make the challah.\" He thought that he was the one who was going to be blamed. That's when my mother started going, \"I did this and I did that, and your father did this, and your brother did that, and so I'm supposed to be the only one to blame? No one asked me to make it, but now I am blamed for it.\" That was a very sad day for her. That was the day she used to say that her challah is not that it is.\nThe last time I made challah for my mother was just about two months ago, and now I am going to tell him what my brother and I cooked up, the recipe, which we gave to her. It worked and it looks like a regular challah. The first thing you do is get some butter out of the fridge. Not cold butter; get it out of the fridge because the temperature of milk when it reacts is different than the temperature of room-temperature water, and when that happens it makes you dough rise much faster and makes it come out nice and beautiful. If you have to use room-temperature milk, add some more yeast so the dough doesn't stay flat. Next thing that you do is add some water and some flour. When I was little I used to watch my mother kneading the dough, but I don't do it that way anymore. What I do now is take the butter and the milk and I get it all out in one place, because I like to use the mixer. When I go to the kitchen in the morning my mother knocks on the door saying \"I need you to make me a challah,\" for once and a half a year or for most of my life.\nIn order to get things over with and to get ready to bring it to her, I have now gotten a mixer for my oven and I make the challah inside. What I do is first make a whole milk and put it all in the bowl. Next, in the bowl I put the rest of the water that I used for cooking, and last of all I add some flour and knead it. I knead it into a ball, it's nice and soft, and I put it straight in my mixer. The reason why I am telling you that is because the last time I made challah I did all this inside. I put the flour in there and when I add the butter, I try to add it the first time and you don't understand it's going to get all over everything around it. When the dough gets thicker, you start doing it again and again, and you don't get it all and you can't take it off. I call you to take it off"

        "output": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Hong Kong  dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Tong Sui?.\nTong Sui is a very common sweet soup. But it can be difficult to serve a delicious one, especially if you havent used too many ingredients. Here is a recipe that only needs a few ingredients. One of them is rice wine, but not sweet rice wine. And not really good for your blood pressure. It is just 3% alcohol wine. I guess if you prefer a little liquor with your sweet soup, you can go for the better wine instead. Tong Sui is usually a dessert served with ice cream or mango after lunch or dinner.\nRinse the 5 tbsp water beetle and add to a small sauce pot. Add the 4-inch piece of bamboo shoots and boil on a high heat until the bamboo has softened. Turn the heat to a low and add the sliced lotus root, and simmer till done. Add the sweet rice wine and lemon juice, let the soup absorb, and then turn the heat off. Add the chopped peanuts and let the soup steep before serving.\nMix milk, sugar, and cocoa powder until it is fine and smooth, then stir in cream. Heat the milk mixture for about 7 minutes on a low heat, and add the vanilla extract, stirring gently. Keep heating until the mixture turns into a very thick texture. Remove from heat, stir in chocolate chips, and keep aside to stay warm. Serve the chocolate soup with whipped cream and a whole almond.\nRinse the rice and soak in lukewarm water for 30 minutes. Drain the water and add half of the water to a small sauce pot. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low heat till the rice has absorbed the water. Once the rice is done, take off the lid and add the remaining half of the water, cover again and cook about the same time. Turn off the heat and let sit in the pot for another 30 minutes.\nOnce the water is absorbed, mash the rice with your hand to make a fine paste. The rice should be sticky. Add the sugar and salt to taste, and then add the cornstarch and beat again with a wooden spoon till smooth.\nCombine the butter and sugar in a sauce pot over a medium heat, and stir until the sugar turns into a honey-like texture. Make sure the butter is not burnt, otherwise the finished product will be bitter tasting, not delicious. Add the chopped peanuts and stir. Meanwhile, grease a pan with butter and melt it on a low heat. Add the peanut butter and stir until it forms a smooth paste. Put the mixture together in a bowl and keep aside.\nPour hot water over the sugar and dissolve it. Separately, heat the whole milk to about 175 degrees C. Once hot, add the milk to the sugar, and let it boil. Keep stirring gently with a wooden spoon until the milk becomes cloudy and thick  do not let it boil on the top of the pan. Once it goes slightly black, the foam will become browny. Turn the heat off and pour into a small pan. Place a wooden stick in the middle of the pan and tilt so that the foam on the side will come down, making a nice decoration for the dessert.\nAfter the milk foam has cooled for five to ten minutes, add the soft chocolate and stir to melt thoroughly. Slowly add the peanut butter paste and keep stirring. Then add the rice paste, stirring until they are well combined. Add 1-2 tbsp of butter, and keep stirring until it is thick and smooth.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees C. Line two baking trays with parchment paper, and lightly grease the paper with light butter. Using a piping bag or spoon, mound small mounds on the baking tray evenly. Bake in an oven for 120 minutes, or 30 minutes for each tray, until a light brown color. Cool and serve.\nThis entry was written by admin, posted on November 7, 2018 at 10:28 pm, filed under Asian Food, Dessert, Easy to Make and tagged brownies, dessert, easy dessert, easy recipe, food, hongkong, m&ms, recipe, socca hongkong, Socca by Yen Chan, sweet.

We recommend checking out our complete beginners beginner's guide for more information.\nHow do I prevent my indoor herbs from growing too much?\nHerbal remedies are not typically grown with the same vigorous production that vegetables or fruits require for optimal quality and safety. They are best left unchecked throughout the growing time, as some spices and medicinal herbs are actually not as much of a strong a drug until they are allowed to develop their full strength.\nHow do I clean my gardening tools?\nTo clean your gardening tools, soak them in warm salt water. Let them soak for at least 20 minutes, then scrub with a good natural soap. If you use your tools regularly, you can do the soaking several times a week.

We have a step-by-step guide available here if you are interested. It's a simple and inexpensive way to help you grow your own produce, especially during the shortening winter season!\nHow do I preserve my fresh herbs and/or veggies like cucumbers and zucchini?\nYou can dry your fresh herbs by hanging your bundles in a warm 80F room. Weigh them down with a can or something heavy down to make sure they don't take a shape you don't expect.\nFor drying cucumbers and zucchini, wash them well and use wire racks, such as the ones you find in your kitchen's dishwasher, to line the bottom of a bowl. Place some aluminum foil on top and use an oven set to about 130F. Leave them to dry for 3 to 7 days, checking them every day to see if they are completely dry.\nHow do you get rid of pests and diseases?\nWhen it comes to dealing with pests and diseases, the best way is to learn about their different types and how to prevent and fix them before they become a problem in your garden. For more information, we cover some of our top tips and tools for dealing with these pesky pests and diseases here.\nCan I use this method if I have a big and old tree?\nThis method should be done to a plant 3 to 10 inches in diameter.

It seems there is a slight difference in the way they interact with the plant, but we haven't noticed any big differences in our grow experiments.\nThe cords start to fray after about 3 to 4 years and sometimes they need to be replaced. However, you can just clip off the frayed sections and new ones will regrow.\nIt can be used as a trellis or a training system. What are some examples?\nYou can use a trellis for vines such as grapes, peas, tomatoes, zucchini and more. It can be a nice way to train the plants or help them to stay closer to the ground.\nWhat is your system that helps train vines to stay closer to the ground or the trellis?\nHow can I train a long plant like okra?\nIt's a common practice to use a long cordon or a climbing rope in order to train the plant.

The same principle applies regardless of if you decide to grow it like you would potatoes or if you use a trellis.\nWill this work with melons?\nWe have a complete guide for growing melons.

Then she told him he was \"the\nking of those who find treasure and give it to people that are poor, and\ntake nothing in return but kindness and honesty from every one and all\nkinds of people.\"\n\nJust before he left he made a vow to find them all again.  Before leaving\nhe thanked her very warmly for the pleasure she had given him by her\ninstruction. She said she had known that he would be a very great\nfavour....  But I shall have to be content to tell her story from the\nbeginning, because I know more about it than she does herself.\n\nWell, now I come to that story, I feel quite excited, for I look upon\nit as one of the jewels of the history of my own county.\n\nThe people I have found it in call it \"The Elstow Jewel\" (Elstow is a\nvery old village on the north side of the river Ouse), but that is only a\nnarrower form of its original and more frequent name--the \"Luffley Jewel\"!\n\nThe village of Elstow is about ten miles north-west of the city of\nNorthampton. The little Ouse, which is only about half a mile across\nbetween the parishes of Elstow and Wilstone, flows under the railway\nbridges, and on one side it runs right through the village on and off\nfor a fair walk.  On the other side a short distance further up it is\nforded by several footpaths, and there is a green where a number of\nfoot-print houses have been built as a result of local improvements in\nthe late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Elstow is of a very\nsmall ancient village, and to the left and right of Luffley, just on\nthis side of the railway, are only a few cottages.\n\nBefore I began to tell you the story, which I shall try to tell as\nbriefly as possible, I had never seen the jewel myself, but I have\nstudied a plate which was copied from its most authentic copy in the\nNorthamptonshire Record Office, and it is still there on exhibition.  It\nis not a very large jewel, and it must have been very hard and fragile\nin those days when it was more than four hundred years old.  It is made\nup of a thin plate of silver set inside a copper border and enclosing\nthe two faces of a square block of porous white stone.

        "output": "What are some herbs I can dry out?\nWhat are herb gardens and what do I do with them now that winter has arrived?\nYou can dry herbs in your dishwasher according to this article from The Kitchn.\nWhile not all types of herbs have the same amount of active medicinal ingredients, your goal with drying them is to capture the healing properties that are lost once the herb goes out of season.\nA herb garden is the space on your balcony, patio, patio or outdoor garden space where you grow your herbs and plants. When you first begin an herb garden, you may choose to start with just one or two plants, but as they mature, you can add more, increasing the size of your herb garden.\nStart with a minimum of three herbs.\nChoose a herb that you will enjoy using.\nHerbs that grow fastest and have the biggest, most aromatic leaves or flowers are best for drying and you can use those leaves right away in herbs and spices or place them in jars to use at a later date.\nYou can use your herb garden to dry fresh herbs when you find them on the side of the road, in a new community or at any other time you want to use them to flavor your food.\nIf you have purchased an herb that has been dried, you dont need to try and make it into an herb garden because its almost certainly not going to grow into a lush green plant.\nHowever, if you have a friend or family member who has harvested herbs before and would like to keep some of these fresh herbs, you can give them the dry ones without needing to create a plan for them to grow.\nAre there any herbs that I can dry out?\nAromatic herbs such as basil, thyme, marjoram, oregano, tarragon, rosemary, mint and sage.\nLeverage a dehydrator for short-term drying or freeze them for longer periods of time.\nYou can use a dehydrator at low temperature to help dry out herbs and then store them in a jar. Just be sure to remove the leaves or parts of the plants that will turn color when exposed to the air during this process.\nFreeze dried herbs last a fairly short time before they go bad and begin to smell unappealing. However, they do keep well if you vacuum-pack them in an airtight container and keep them in your freezer.\nYou can buy herbs already dried if your kitchen does not have a dehydrator. There is a huge variety, especially online, that allows you to find the type of herb you prefer the most.\nWhile you may not be able to find the specific herbs you want available in your local stores, you can often find dried herbs on Amazon.com depending on your location or on eBay, another online auction site, if you live somewhere where they do not provide enough customers to keep dried herbs in stock.\nAfter you have dried your herbs, its time to figure out how you will store them.\nStore your dried herbs in different ways depending on if you will be using them in your food preparation or if you are wanting to hang on to them for later use.\nOnce your herbs are dried, store them in an airtight container in a cool dark place when you arent planning on using them for a long period.\nIf you dont plan on using your herbs for the long haul, you can store them in a vacuum-sealed container in a refrigerator for up to three months, but I would suggest storing them in the pantry in an airtight jar and using them regularly.\nIf you need to take your dried herbs with you, you can store them in an airtight jar. Just make sure to seal the lid and put them where you arent likely to shake them up and then break the seal on them.\nTo get the best possible out of your herbs, you need to keep them out of air and away from moisture or they will lose their medicinal properties.\nIn a normal kitchen, this isnt a huge problem because your kitchen is generally dry. However, if you live somewhere humid, such as in the southeast of the United States, you need to store your dried herbs away from moisture, both in your pantry and out of your kitchen.\nIf you find dried herbs you no longer need, you can give them away or use them for other hobbies, such as paper crafts.\nIf you have too much of an herb for your immediate needs, you can create a poultice by mixing dried herb with some water to use as a poultice or compress to reduce swelling or soreness in a spot on your body.\nWhen it comes to creating poultices, always use an herb that is known to do no harm, as you do not want to use one that could lead to an allergic reaction. When in doubt, ask a doctor because the last thing you want to do is use an allergen or poison to heal your skin.\nHow Do I Choose Plants To"

        "output": "Whats the largest star in our galaxy? And why is so important? In order to correctly answer this question, one should first determine what we mean by a star. The best thing to think about when we talk about this astronomical object are our old friends the sun. The sun, however, is a relatively huge star in comparison to all the others in the cosmic pool.\nImage: Scaled-down version of the most massive stars in the universe, called red supergiants, like Betelgeuse. They are so massive that they collapse inward onto themselves, resulting in the formation of black holes.\nThe reason why we should think of the sun as the largest star in our galaxy is that it contains approximately 99.86 percent of all the stars in our galaxy. Its just that the remaining 0.01 percent are rather massive, and if only for that reason they seem to dwarf all other stars.\nFor instance, the most massive star in the galaxy is called Betelgeuse. Although it is massive, Betelgeuse is a red supergiant. It is so massive that this star actually collapses down onto itself, and if this were to occur on Earth (for some incomprehensibly unfathomable reason), it would probably result in the formation of a black hole. So theres a real possibility that our little white sun (and other stars) are the only examples of stars in our galaxy.\nIn actual fact, that might not be such a big problem. The fact of the matter is that although Betelgeuse is a red supergiant it has a very small percentage compared to other huge stars with a significant percentage in the galaxy.\nNow, where does the name of this massive object come from? It comes from the Arabic word betulekhus, which means hand of Jupiter. If you remember back to a couple of posts ago when we talked about the names of certain astrological events such as Mercury and Venus youll notice how many of them seem to originate from the Babylonian Gods and Goddesses of antiquity. This is not by chance: The most recent discovery of these names come from the ancient Babylonian calendar, which contained a list of 30 star names on the wall.\nSo there we have it: The most massive star in the universe. Now you will have to wait for some more posts to be written before you can get a clearer understanding of Betelgeuse.\nIf you have any questions, criticisms or suggestions for what you would like for us to cover next, please use the form below and let us know.

        "output": "Hi, I need to find the area of a 20 sided die for my math homework. Can you help me do that?\n\nA: This is an interesting problem.  The area of the 20-sided die will be the area of a trapezoid whose bottom half is a trapezoid, whose top half is a pentagon.  The length of the top and bottom is the radius of the 20-sided die, and the length between any point on the top side to any point on the bottom side is the length of a side of the pentagon.\nThe area of a trapezoid is: ((b+h)/2)*a.  In this case, both a and b are equal; therefore, the area is ((b+b)/2)*a = b*a.  So the area of the trapezoid is the area of the trapezoid at the top minus the area of the trapezoid at the bottom.  The area at the bottom is A1=((h1+1/2*r)/2).  Then A2=[((l)/2).(1/2*r)+r]-A1.  In this case, A1 = (.5*r*r)/2 = .25*r^2, and A2=((r^2+.5*l^2)/2.  Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is .5*(r^2+.5*l^2)-.5*r^2=.5*l^2.\nThe area of the lower triangle is the area of the upper trapezoid divided by 2:\nA(U)=(.5*l^2)/2=.25*l^2\nLet S be the total area.  Then S=2*A(U)+P.  P=A(P) is the area of the polygon.  As M.A.R. points out, P= .5*r^2*(21+2*sqrt(5)-5/2)-.5*l^2.  Therefore, S=2*(.25*l^2)+.5*r^2*(21+2*sqrt(5)-5/2)-.5*l^2\nThat gives us S=.5*(r^2*(21+2*sqrt(5)-5/2)-l^2)\nThat's how far I've gotten, but as usual, the answer is nowhere near precise in this approximation.  It may be possible to solve for S using the formula that a right-angled triangle is to a rectangle as that rectangle is to a trapezoid.  If so, then we'll get a formula that can be plugged in to get a very precise answer.\n--John\n\nA: \nYou will get more than you were looking for by using the following formula:\n$$A = \\frac{b(b+h)}{4}\\tag1$$\nLet's see why.\nThe perimeter $l$ of $\\newcommand{\\A}{\\mathcal{A}}\\A^{n-2} \\times \\frac{n-2}{5}\\,$ will be $(n-2)\\times r$, and the area $S$ will be\n$$\\int_1^{\\tfrac{n-2}{5}} \\pi r^2\\,\\mathrm dr = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{2}\\Big\\vert_1^{\\tfrac{n-2}{5}} = \\frac{\\pi \\big(\\tfrac{(n-2)^2}{20}\\big)}{2} = \\tfrac{4\\, \\pi}{5}\\,\\frac{(n-2)^2}{20}\\tag2$$\nso\n$$\\tag3 S = \\frac{(n-2)^2}{5}\\,\\frac{4\\, \\pi}{5}$$\nand equation (1) gives one area exactly.\n\nAs an aside, let's see why formula (3) is correct:\nWe have\n$$S = \\frac{(n-2)^2}{5}\\, \\frac{4\\, \\pi}{5} = \\frac{(n-2)\\cdot(n-2)}{5}\\cdot\\frac{4\\, \\pi}{5}$$\n$$S = \\frac{(n-2)^2\\, \\pi}{5}\\hspace{120mm}\\tag4$$\nNote that the number $\\frac{4}{5}$ is nothing else but $2\\cdot\\frac{"

        "output": "I'm trying to learn how to install window blinds. Is there a way for me to install it as the blinds are on the window?\nYes, you can get some kind of special kind of clamps if you go to an area where you can special order blinds and there, there you will find a type of clamp that will hold it up to a different part or whatever the case may be.\nHow do I install them to the ceiling?\nWell, if you have any idea how to go about it without having them at an area where you can figure it out, that may be the only other alternative to look at if you have the window up.\nWhat are the different types of blinds that you see in homes?\nWell most of the ones that I see are blinds that are usually made of wood and they kind of have a different panel look to them or a roller one. But there's still lots that come in other types and they have their own kind of different ones. Roller blinds, they're the most popular style that I see, and they're not made out of wood. A lot of times they're made out of vinyl, but a lot of them are made out of cloth.\nWhy are the blinds so expensive?\nWell, that depends upon what you are selecting. If you go to a retailer, they all have different prices of blinds and it's just kind of to the seller's whim on what they're going to charge for their blinds. So you may end up paying too much, but if you shop around and you shop online, you'll find the cheapest one or a similar type of one that comes at a more affordable price. So by doing that, you can then figure out what is a good price and then you'll make a purchase on that one.\nHow often should I clean my blinds?\nWell, if they are light colored, as you just said, then the more often you can clean them out to actually get rid of some dirt and some of the dust so that it's not actually built up and that you're allowing the light to actually get in. So if you want to clean out your blinds and get them fresh all the time, then there are many different things you can do it with depending upon what kind of blinds they are. Some of them you can wash with a damp cloth. Some of them have something that has a cleaning cloth built into it with a little clip. So you can pull it down and wash that particular one. So it depends upon the type of blind.\nHow do you remove the old blinds from the windows?\nWell, if you actually just pull them down and you're working with wood ones, then they may just fall down. If they have hinges, you may just go and you just take it out, if not, you may have to use a hammer or just use your hands and they will just come out.

That chalk material is not so much about how much it's on there, but it's about how well it's mixed with the paint so you actually do want to clean it very good with water that's been sprayed with distilled water. Just put it there on there. You don't actually want to scrub it, but it needs to be wet down and then you spray it and let it dry for a few minutes so that way you end up covering every place and then you should go ahead and paint it.\nWhy chalkboard paint is not getting off?\nWell, it depends upon how well you're applying it and if it's not actually getting past the wall itself.

He had spent the whole summer of 1965 as a camp counselor at the nearby Ames Research Laboratory. The work was fun, but he was also a member of the American Astronaut Training Initiative.\n\nAnd so when his father came home one day, he found one of his workbooks, labeled \"1965,\" and a note: \"Son, you've already left. I do not hate you, I hate science labs, please take my father's name.\"\n\n**\"Your last project is the finest thing I have ever produced . . .** \"\n\nAfter finishing the workbook, he learned that his father was a NASA engineer. He had written his son a last will and testament in which he gave _most_ of his possessions to charity. One of the exceptions to this was an old 1958 Volkswagen Beetle. His father had left a note, signed \"Your last project,\" in which he said that, even though the Beetle was an old clunker, the car had been \"modified to include a nuclear reactor and a small star-shooting pistol.\" He also said he _regretted_ his decision, but did not explain why.\n\n**He pulled up to the curb in front of his school, then got out** and walked around to the driver's side, unlocked the trunk, and pulled out his old workbook and the note his father had left. He shoved the note and his father's workbook into his backpack and got back in his car.\n\n**He was in the fifth grade. He had been picked his entire school** year as a peer counsellor, and had recently received an academic scholarship to the nearby New Jersey Military Academy. His parents came for graduation, and they cried and hugged. He told his father that he had a surprise for him, but his father didn't like surprises.\n\n\"You've already brought me one,\" his father said.\n\n\"Not like _this_ surprised, Dad. I'll explain when we get home.\"\n\nHis father looked confused. \"Well, okay. What is it?\"\n\n\"I'm dropping out.\"\n\n**They both cried and hugged again, and he told his father** that he had decided to become a Marine; he would be flying his father's old VW Beetle across the country to San Diego, California, to join the American Astronaut Training Initiative. He didn't see much point in going to school, nor did he have much money.\n\nSilly for such a smart man to have such poor business sense. But still, he smiled and clasped his son's forearm with his free hand. He gave him one more long hug, and then two long hugs.\n\n**When he was fifteen, he was able to drive the car across** the country and into California for his first day of training, despite having no driver's license. He was also able to convince a bunch of senior military officers that a young boy with a .22 pistol and a nuclear reactor could be responsible enough to be an astronaut-in-training.\n\n**The officers had a special conference room at the American Astronaut** Training Initiative, and it was in there that he met his first fellow astronaut-in-"

C. Andersen won a poetry contest and was able to publish his writing. While working at a printing house, Andersen met the royal bookbinder. The two got very close, and Andersen lived with him and studied arts and crafts. Eventually, Andersen was hired to work for the royal household.\nThe story of his life is a rollercoaster ride of the mundane and the wild. Andersen met royalty. He studied bookbinding, met and was hired by a royal bookbinder and lived in a cottage on the grounds of a palace (his writing was very popular). Then, when the printer fired him, Andersen was given the unfortunate duty of making up the royal letters by writing them himself. Finally, Andersen was so tired of his work that he would write the letters while in his bed, then get up and put his name into the letters and send them away.\nAfter that he tried other jobs, such as a clerk. When he was hired as a clerk, he was instructed to draw up all the paperwork. He was then fired because he did not know how to fill in the blanks correctly.

Buchan's family was not rich, not poor, but they had financial problems. He started out at Edinburgh University to study medicine, and then transferred to another college to study law. He would eventually graduate in both.\nBuchan had other plans, though. He found his way into the diplomatic corps where he could serve his country and explore the world at the same time! The young man started as part of the British Army in India. While there, he wrote his first book. It was called The Half-Hearted and it was written as a satire about his days on the India Corps.\nOn his return to the UK, Buchan decided there should be a book about military law called, Law and the Soldier. It was an immediate success, and it helped to secure his job as an official writer for the War Office in the UK. This book was followed by other books including, A Letter from Scotland and John Ronald, His Family and Friends.\nBuchan decided to take a different approach to his stories, and created the character of Richard Hannay, a man who solved many crimes and mysteries, including The Thirty - Nine Steps and The Prisoner of Zenda (a must-read). This was the birth of the adventure-thriller genre.\nBuchan decided it was time to get out of the UK as well as the diplomatic corps, and became a journalist. His articles were published in the best of UK and French papers. Buchan became very popular. In fact, he was so popular that when war broke out, he was chosen as the Minister of Information for the UK. Although this meant he had to resign his journalistic and writing jobs, he did well in this position. He also wrote the book, The Battle for Barrens, which was based on his travels to the Canadian North West and served as a basis for his work there.\nWhile an active politician, Buchan was in no way an inexperienced person or dull. He could be a diplomat when he needed to be, but he could also be quite the adventurer. During World War One, he used his contacts and skills to gain the trust of the Canadians, and was a part in saving many from the terrible battles on the French/German border. He came down with pneumonia after an adventure, and was released from his military service.\n"

However, our perception is often wrong when something very different from our normal surroundings. For example, some types of jellyfish, or jellyfish in general, are not really jelly (no carbohydrates), but they do have an internal jelly system in their bell. When they reach their adult size, their bell is an opaque, transparent, and transparent structure that allows light to pass through. These jellyfish float on the surface of the ocean because they absorb most of the light that they are in contact with. When under the water, they allow more light to pass through.\nThe main jellyfish of the US are called the moon jelly, but the two most dangerous types are Portuguese Manoel and lion man. The moon jelly is so named because when it’s time for the moon to do its main duty, it turns into a floating mass of jelly. It is so named because when it’s time for the moon to do its main duty, it turns into a floating mass of jelly. It is so named because when it’s time for the moon to do its main duty, it turns into a floating mass of jelly.\nOne of the most dangerous types of jellyfish is the Portuguese Manoel. It’s not called the Portuguese Manoel due to its large size as other species have larger than normal sizes, it’s named after the Portuguese explorer and explorer who first discovered the species and brought it to the US. It’s considered to be more dangerous than the lion man because it has one of the fastest speeds of movement and also has a higher rate of infestation. It’s also called the Portuguese Manoel because it is able to infest humans, and it’s a species that attacks humans.\nThe Lion Man is the second most dangerous species that is found in the US. It has an extremely painful sting and it can be extremely deadly. The lion man has a body that can grow anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds and it’s also extremely hard to identify because there are so many different types and species of jellyfish that the two names can also apply to their own jellyfish. It’s also called the lion man because it uses a sting on humans and it can be extremely dangerous.\nThe Moon jellyfish is the third most dangerous jellyfish, and it’s considered to be one of the most common jellyfish in the world. It’s also called the moon jellyfish because it’s so transparent that it is sometimes called moon jelly. The name is due to the fact that if it’s in sunlight, it will become very transparent. This jellyfish is said to be the number one jellyfish that has been known to cause a fatal accident. It’s been known to cause a fatal accident because of how it infests humans.\nSo to answer your question, this is the jellyfish that is said to be one of the most dangerous, and that is the Portuguese Manoel. It’s called this because it is the largest and most dangerous jellyfish. It can also be found in the United States because there are a number of species of jellyfish that can be found in the United States. So this is the jellyfish that is one of the most dangerous and that is the Portuguese Manoel.\nWhat is your jellyfish’s size?\nThat depends on the size of the jellyfish you’re talking about. If I was talking about a jellyfish, one jellyfish is a little bigger than a human being, and so it’s not too big. But if I’m talking about a larger jellyfish, one of the best-known jellies is the moon jelly, which has been around since the Jurassic Era. The reason for its name is because it’s a huge number of jellyfish and it’s found in every ocean and every ocean because of its size.\nHow much do jellyfish cost?\nThere’s no doubt that jellyfish are a very popular, very expensive type of food, but the question is how much are they worth? Now before we get into the math, I need to give you a little context. I’m actually pretty excited to tell you about the price of jellyfish. I’ve spent a few days online looking into this, and it’s really hard to find information on jellyfish prices because of the subject itself. Jellyfish are not something that people usually pay that much for. But there are a few things to consider before we dive into what the price of jellyfish actually is.\nHere’s my first thought. The vast majority of jellyfish are very small and therefore do not require much time and effort to care for. On the other hand, jellyfish are expensive, so when you’re a first-time owner you probably don’t want to end up with a lot of"

Because people need food they can’t buy food. No grocery store no food, no groceries no food, no jobs no groceries, no stores no job, without those there’s no food. Simple.\nAnd also the argument I have read on this website against these desers is ridiculous. One person saying you don’t like it or don’t care about it doesn’t matter. People still eat McDonald’s in countries like Germany because I have eaten there.\nI am not saying that the food desert argument is true. I am simply telling you what I believe to be the facts. A lot of people just don’t care, so that’s a real problem.\nAnd lastly. What did I say? All I said here was that McDonald’s opened here, because that’s what it is. I don’t know why you’re trying to get back on the topic. You lost that round I don’t see what you’re getting back at, or making points with. Just because things have been built doesn’t mean there are no food deserts, nor does it say that people don’t go through problems with lack of groceries.

I wish this was a discussion about people who do or don’t eat them.\nWhat I don’t like at all is the way this story is being twisted. I don’t like the way it is being said that McDonalds is bad or that he is bad or her and her son is bad.\nThey are just trying to make money. Just like you and I.

It is a fact that people need food, and do eat McDonalds and other places.

Any suggestions on how to do that?\nIf you don't want to get really strict with your cat and just want a preventative measure, the best option to try is to add a cat deterent spray such as \"Repellente De Chacao Para Animales Domiciliados\" or one similar to it. You can find these at any pet store.\nYou will need to apply each night for about a week for it to have an effect and remember that the spray will work better if the wind is not coming over your property at the time.\nIf that doesn't work, you will have to try to train your cat to stay indoors and be on guard whenever your neighbour's cat is coming over to yours. To achieve this you can use some cat treats to lure him to the door. If one cat can be trained to stay inside, any cat is capable of it. Keep trying.\nFinally, you can build a very good wall with wooden planks to completely close off your neighbours' garden. But you will need to check the city's rules of that particular place."

Now we know when it's coming out: February 2010.\nBlizzard made the announcement along with the title of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, a game that it says will be a sequel to the first StarCraft.\nThis information isn't new, except for the official date Blizzard has been teasing us since E3 2008. While there are no plans for a release date, BlizzCon 2008 is coming up next month, and the announcement will be a keynote in the opening session so we'll have to wait no longer. With the release date set, the company will also give us details about the games' multiplayer mode, which it teased at Gamescom this year.\nStarcraft 2 will feature the same three factions as the original game â€“ Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. However, Blizzard is staying tight-lipped about the story, so the exact storyline is anyone's guess. Blizzard also says that there will be new technologies that allow the game to run on current generation gaming consoles that haven't been announced yet.\nFor more on StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, check out our first hands-on report from Gamescom 2008.\nKronorion wrote: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/arc...10?id=724636\nYeah, seems like a better than average plan.\nBut, seriously, I'm looking forward to seeing more about the game.\nWell according to Blizzards own plans Starcraft 3 wont come out 2009\nNow, it wouldn't be a bad thing if Blizzard didn't really know how long Starcraft 2 is going to take to develop\nBut still, that means that if it does not come out in late 2009, or even early 2010 Starcraft 3 will probably not be coming for almost 4 years\nby Kronorion » Oct 21 2008, 23:49\nWell, this site says it has a target release date of January 2010:\nhttp://www.vgchartz.com/article/30392/ ... o-1-2010-/\nIf Blizzard hasn't set the release date yet, it might not be coming out until after January 2010...\nby Soren » Oct 22 2008, 5:06\nIf Blizzard hasn't set the release date yet, it might not be coming out until after January 2010...[/QUOTE]\nwell it really doesn't matter..\ni just want these games out\nby Kronorion » Dec 4 2008, 20:50\nhttp://www.vgchartz.com/article/31191/ ... e-out-soon/\nStarcraft 2 release date set for Q1 of 2009.\nhttp://www.blizzard.com/games/starcraft2/\nLooks like the story is pretty much identical to the Starcraft: Brood War story for Protoss and Terran.\nby Kronorion » May 21 2009, 11:18\nBlizzard CEO: 'We're still having trouble figuring out the Zerg'\nhttp://blogs.koti.ee/k_kaulfors/\n"

The first distillation fraction contains gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.\nAfter separation, the different fractions of the crude oil can be stored for several weeks in large underground storage tanks.\nIn 2012, 17.2 million barrels of crude oil entered refineries in the EU and EEA. The crude oil was refined to produce 575 million liters of high-octane gasoline, as well as 179 billion liters of other refined fuels.\nIn 2012, there were 65,000 petrol stations in the EU and EEA, approximately 140 petrol stations per million inhabitants. That is slightly more than the number found in countries in the USA (138).\nMost stations have a total of nine petrol pumps. In 90% of the petrol stations petrol is sold exclusively at one pump. The average distance between the nearest refueling station and the home or work place is 2.4 km (1.5 mi).\nPetrol prices vary by country, but average 28% of the per capita income.\nAround the EU and EEA, 352 million passenger vehicles are in operation.\nAn increase in car registrations by almost 5% compared with 2011 shows that the car is still seen as a status symbol and has moved from a hobby to a necessity.\nIn the EU-27, 280 million cars are registered, which is 5% more than in 2011.\nThe total cost of car ownership – a purchase price, depreciation, fuel and insurance, maintenance, repairs, and fees such as parking, tolls or tax – are considered when assessing car ownership, including car ownership costs for all cars.\nOn average, a car costs approximately EUR 7,200 per year to keep (fuel costs and ownership costs only).\nEU-EAA\nFuel – Oil\nFuel – Petrol and diesel\nFuel – biofractions and hydrogen\nFuel – electric, nuclear and other alternative fuels\nFuel – transport policy\nEnergy performance – transport\nTransport infrastructure – network, construction and operation\nTransport performance and statistics\nEnvironmental performance – transport\nToxic emissions - transport emissions\nWaste management – Transport\nEconomic and Financial Affairs\nEconomic performance of transport\nSocial performance of transport\nTrans-European networks\nUrban policy – mobility\nResearch and innovation – TEN-T transports\nRoad sector – transport of goods\nRailway sector – transport of goods\nAir sector – transport of goods\nSea shipping – transport of goods\nEnergy Efficiency\nEnergy – transport policy\nEnergy – oil\nEnergy – renewable energy\nEnergy – energy efficiency\nRenewable energy – solar thermal\nRenewable energy – wind power\nRenewable energy – hydroelectricity\nRenewable energy – biomass\nRenewable energy – other renewable energy\nRenewable energy – transport\nEnergy consumption policy – transport\nEnergy – fuel\nEnergy – waste\nEnergy supply – oil\nEnergy supply – gas\nEnergy supply – nuclear\nEnergy supply – renewable energy\nEnergy supply – conventional fuels\nClimate- change – air quality\nAir quality – nitrogen dioxide\nAir quality – nitrogen oxide\nAir quality – other pollutants\nClimate-change – climate\nEnergy – electricity\nClimate – sea level\nClimate – temperature\nTransport systems are becoming smarter as technology improves, so that a bigger share of the transport system can be controlled by computers, as opposed to people.

Thanks in advance!\nYou don’t need to over season the steak to let it become too salty, instead use a drizzle of olive oil to add extra flavour and a little pepper.\nYou can lightly brush the meat with a spray and add a small amount of garlic (1 tsp.) and crushed salt and pepper for taste and seasoning.\nPreheat grill or panini and place the steak onto the hot surface, leaving the cooking surface clear and uncluttered and allow some space for the edges to brown.\nBrush both sides of meat with a little oil to help the meat brown.\nLet the meat cook at a high heat until it reaches 50C then turn off the heat for 2-3 minutes.\nThis will enable the meat to reach the correct internal temperature without drying out.\nYou will get better results by using 100% grass–fed beef.\nFor best results, ask the butcher about the meat they have available for you.\nIf it’s possible to find a local butcher, that will be the best option.\nThere are 78 different vitamins and minerals that your body needs for good health.\nA balanced diet with adequate vitamins and minerals is the best way to prevent osteoporosis.\nCalcium is necessary for healthy bones, but if you’re taking the wrong vitamins, you can easily become susceptible to osteoporosis later in life.\nThe average person eats approximately 40% of their daily recommended amounts of calcium each day!\nVitamin D, for example, is a known risk factor for osteoporosis!\nThe key thing to remember here is that the way you feed your body matters.\nStudies have shown that vitamin D supplements can actually lead people to have significantly reduced intestinal calcium absorption when not combined with the right vitamins and minerals.\nSo it is important to make sure you have the vitamins your body actually needs.\nFor those trying to avoid a risk of osteoporosis, calcium should only be combined with vitamins and minerals that allow it to be absorbed in your body.\nThis is why it’s important to choose your nutrients based on research and not just based on a quick search.\nThere are many ways to eat a healthier diet, however the best way to ensure you get all the vitamins and minerals in your body is by eating a fully balanced diet.\nIf you’re looking for an easy way to boost your intake of these nutrients, consider trying a vitamin and mineral supplement.\nThese supplements are easy to find and work to fill the gaps you’re missing in your daily diet.\nIf you’re still having trouble finding a supplement that works for you, we’d like to recommend the one we’ve personally used and recommend: the Osteomax Complete-4.\nThis supplement is a great formula that’s made up of the right combination of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to help your body absorb calcium.\nCalcium is the only mineral your body needs for healthy bones.\nWhile there are other vitamins and minerals in your diet, if the calcium is not able to be absorbed in your body, then you will lose out on the nutrients intended to strengthen your bones.\nTo help make sure your body gets all of the calcium it needs to properly absorb and prevent osteoporosis, consider our latest product recommendation: the Osteomax Complete-4.\nThis product combines different vitamins and minerals in order to help your body absorb the calcium, and to make sure your body gets all of the nutrients you need to stay healthy and strong.\nA well-rounded supplement like this one is the best way to ensure you’re getting the vitamins and minerals you need to live a happy, healthy life.\nDo you know someone who could benefit from this post: 5 Things You Never Knew about Osteoporosis?\nPlease let us know in the comments below and we’ll share on our Facebook page!"

They only need a passport and can enter Canada as they would with most other countries.\nVisitors travelling for reasons of tourism, or business/employment for less than 90 days may apply for a six month entry visa on arrival at border points in Canada, as they do in the United States.  For more details, make sure to check out a list of the ten countries Canada allows entry from for visitors, with no visa.\nThe E2 treaty investor visa is one of four foreign investor visas in the United States.

        "instruction": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?",
        "output": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?\"\nThe answer to this question is: \"Because banks' customers cannot use cash as collateral for their loans if the bank uses it.\"\nNo customers or depositors will allow a bank to use its reserves; instead, they will try to take them immediately upon any danger that they might be at risk. However, depositors and investors can accept losses in the form of a write-down or loss of their loan when they deposit cash with their banks (although, a deposit with an intermediary such as a bank is often treated as a \"liability\" and not \"cash\" for them).\nThus, cash in the bank accounts of ordinary depositors serves only as a buffer for their banks that has potentially no value or use in the event of any loss by the bank.\nIn the event of a run on the bank, it is not the \"cash\" in the bank accounts of the depositors and investors that is the cause of the problem; rather, it is the belief by depositors and investors that they have deposits whose value is greater than the value of their \"cash\" and \"liquid liabilities\" (cash, short-term Treasury bills, various certificates of deposits, and interest- and principal-paying loans) in their bank accounts.\nThus, the loss of the \"cash\" in the bank accounts, together with a loss of the funds in \"liquid liabilities\" like cash, treasury bills, and interest- and principal-paying loans, should not cause the loss of the deposits of the bank even if they are the only assets of the bank.\nSo, are banks really holding \"uninsured\" cash in their vaults? No: there is no such cash that they can use but depositors cannot. Banks are the only creditors (aside from government) that can use this reserve (since it is the only reserve that is not held with the government) (although the government has also issued $4 of debt for each $1 in cash held in bank vaults).\nCan bank credit expand indefinitely?\nSince a bank's \"money\" comes from depositors and investors giving it to the bank with an ability to redeem it for cash or for other assets, the amount of deposits banked-to-deposited credit grows without any limit.\nBanking credit can become as large as an amount equal to the amount of cash deposited with the banks in the United States multiplied by the number of bank depositors and loaned to them.\nAs long as people believe that they can redeem their deposits for cash (\"liquid liabilities\") at the banks, they will continue to give those banks their deposits.\nThen, these deposits can be loaned to other investors and depositors to enable them to acquire a variety of other assets and to use them in business and residential activities.\nThis leads to the banking industry becoming so-called a \"self-liquidating\" system as deposits continue to be loaned over and over again while the original deposits are being redeemed.\nThus, the original deposits with banks can become many times larger than the original deposits in their bank accounts as the amount of liabilities of such banks increases exponentially.\nWhat happens if the public no longer believes that they can redeem their deposits (liquid liabilities) at the banks?\nThe only thing that stops banks from being allowed to increase their liabilities indefinitely is for the public to believe that they or their family could not obtain cash or other liquid liabilities upon the demand for their bank deposits.\nIf this happens, then banks are required to raise cash as a kind of insurance to cover their liabilities.\nThis requires banks to hold more cash (and other liquid assets) in their vaults to cover their bank liabilities so that they are not risking to have all of their bank deposits lost in the event of any problem.\nThis is known as a \"run on the bank,\" and the bank's risk is the possibility that it may not be able to hold its deposit liabilities (cash, treasury bills, certificates of deposit, and loans) long enough or to sufficiently increase the rate of cash lending (depositing cash) upon the demand for cash and \"liquid\" liabilities by depositors (since there is only so much cash and Treasury bills that a bank can hold under the FDIC).\nWhen there is a bank \"run,\" banks may not be able to borrow additional funds (especially from the Fed) in an amount that is close to the outstanding loan amounts that their customers are asking for their withdrawal, which means that bank runs can be fatal to the banks.\nDo banks have enough \"mature\" loans with bank clients to enable them to meet their deposit liabilities?\nNo, the vast majority of banks' deposits are \"mature,\" and they should be able to raise at least enough (based on cash and Treasury bills in their vaults) to meet their depositor customers' demands (on average)"

        "output": "Can you tell my a story about nuclear physics like dr Seuss?\nThe trouble with the \"grey goo\" scenario in which we accidentally create intelligent nanomachines with an agenda of their own...\nYes, you can say that again.\nThe world is full of potential \"grey goo\" scenarios, but I don't think this specific example has ever actually happened. I think if it did happen, it would have been documented by now.\nThe real \"grey goo\" risks are with bio-engineering, i.e. creating life -- and you actually see all kinds of people who are convinced we should do that right now.\nThey've never understood that you should create a genome with some time in-between. You can't make a genome that says \"here: create life\", because life is too complex.\nWe know how to create life, if we had a lot of time and a lot of money, and we wanted to. We know how to make an entire genome, including the protein production part. So if we didn't want to do that, and wanted to have a few genes which produce life, for example, we could probably do that. And I'm not sure that's the right place to start.\nIf you want to create life, it's better to think of creating individual genes and putting them into an existing genome, so they can get into the appropriate cells.\nWhen I was doing research for my book about the human genome, I went to visit a plant genetech company, and I saw a room of microscopes. In the microscope it was very obvious when the cells had been attacked by their own genome, because it would kill off every cell in the plant. It took out the whole plant. That was a \"grey goo\" scenario.\nNow I did it intentionally: I said, let's see if we can create a genetic virus which will destroy every cell of the plant in this company.\nThey couldn't protect themselves: they couldn't turn off their gene production equipment, because if they did, they'd also kill every plant inside the factory.\nIt has a silver lining: it shows how difficult it is to create life in a single step.\nWe can't do it yet, so I don't think we can even begin to contemplate doing it now. But if we did have the time, money and skill-base we need to do this, it wouldn't be that difficult to do.\nYou must be thinking of the whole \"synthetic life\" thing that's now a thing...\nWe've seen this story about the \"syn-bacteria\". That was in a paper which I consider to be pure hype. The \"genes\" that they published were the genes that they were adding for a given purpose. It wasn't life that they were creating.\nThe reason why they wanted to do this was because there have been other people who have claimed to have done this. There was actually a company where they thought they had created life. That was the \"J. Craig Venter Institute\". The \"syn-bacteria\" didn't quite do it, but he's the guy who's doing all the \"syn-life\".\nAnd he's doing it for the same reason that people think we should be doing it. It's not because they're being sneaky. It's because everybody knows they should be doing this.\nHow could he make synthetic life?\nIn principle you could just take all the genes that you need and make your whole organism. That's what's known as a synthetic organism.\nYou can have a single cell that can live for years in a test tube, and it's been done. That means you are able to make a life of any kind. If you could do it well enough and fast enough, you could take all the genes out there and write a code which contains them.\nIt takes you a long time to write a gene. It's not something that happens every day. But you can think of \"genes\" as little blocks of text. And if you have a text editor you can write a new text easily. So it's not really a problem for us if we want to write a new text, and if it takes us time to write it. If we want to write 50,000 or 80,000 new genes, it won't take us very long, because you can just write it again and again. And if you don't want to write it again, you can record it on a CD. That's all possible now.\nIf someone wants to do this, they have to be really careful: you have to make sure they don't write the wrong text. And that means that they should be doing it with"

But a lot of studies are done with other methods instead of caloric intake.\nDo you have any references to other studies than Caloric intake to explain why it’s “possibly an underestimation”?\nDo it a lot. But don’t tell me people have no idea how to do it properly. They do. That's what I mentioned in the thread, as you know.\nI agree, no one is suggesting you do it wrong. But many people are still doing it wrong.\nIf you don't believe me go try doing a caloric balance. If you believe you don't know how to do it, you absolutely don't know how to do it right.\nMany have the common sense to know you can't just eat more protein, even if it is high quality protein, and burn less fat. Just by doing more exercise, you're going to burn more fat regardless of how much protein you take in.\nDo it a lot. But don't tell me people have no idea how to do it properly. They do.\nI'm an exercise physiologist, so I may be biased, but I don't think many people can do a properly calculated metabolic diet for long, even with some form of calorie counting, if you aren't aware of some of the intricacies in energy expenditure. One of the things I hear frequently from people is that \"I know it's like a 3000 calorie deficit and I've lost weight, but it's hard, I can't lose more weight anymore?\"... because they can't do the same metabolic diet any more. The problem is that their metabolism had already adapted. They adjusted and as a result their results diminished. Now if they aren't getting exercise, if they are going higher in the same amount of calories as they did when working out previously, they will gain what they lost (or more), as they were basically doing more work than they want. And if they were doing this before, that means they were probably doing something wrong. The exercise is important, but I think that a lot of people think that exercise isn't essential and so they don't do it, and some are just not sure how to do it. So what may be necessary is a proper introduction to proper methods. Exercise is NOT the only component to success... in fact, in some cases exercise does more that not help.\nWhat is your recommended method for someone to keep weight off long term without resorting to drugs?\nCan you please elaborate on what you mean? How is it that proteins, carbohydrates, or fats burn fats at different rates, but 'protein' always equals 'fat' and 'carb' always equals 'fat' - even though 'protein' and 'carb' always have a different 'weight', different energy values, different types of atoms and electrons and therefore can't act the same way?\nWhat is it about vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, etc that makes them so totally inert, incapable of being used as energy by the body that they cannot be deemed to have calories (or at least not in any significant quantity) while carbohydrates, protein and fat are all deemed to have caloric value?\nI don't believe any of them have calories in significant quantities.\nAren't you confusing the weight of something with its caloric content?\nI think he's saying the way calories are measured is wrong, and that they should not be measuring it as a result of an individual's metabolism, but rather their weight and the amount that was burned.\nI think that is the idea.

        "output": "I’m planning to visit Okinawa Japan from April 7th to April 10th. Do you have any recommendation on what to do while I’m there? We know Odaiba is a must but if there are more things to see in the western side of the island we’re up for it!\nHi, how long you’re planning on staying in Okinawa? I’d start with Okinawa City. There’s a few good things I can recommend that’s not too far off the beaten path. On the beach there the Okinawa-chan Museum, the Ocean Fun Park, and Shuri and Kunimaru Castle Ruins to name a few. Inside the city, the Okinawa Peace Memorial Park, the Peace Memorial Hall, and The Okinawa Open-Air Museum are all in one place along the ocean and should draw you in. Then, head over to Okinawa City Station and take the train to Naha. There’s a lot there. My favorite are the Kokuu-ji Zen Temple, Tsuboya Paintmaking Village, and the Okinawa Prefectural Museum Art Gallery, just to name a few. Then, head back to Okinawa City via train and you’re in Okinawa City again.\nIn Naha, for the other side of the island, there’s Yaeyama Choshi Ferry Port, Iriomote, Taketomi, Ishigaki, Kiten, and Yonaguni. You are going to have to go to Ishigaki and then the ferry out to Yonaguni. There’s a few small places in Ishigaki but you really need to explore Yonaguni.\nYonaguni is amazing. It’s the island in the shape of a giant wave, and I guess a lot of the stuff here are rock formations that look like they’re underwater. I’ve never been here but I’ve heard stories of it being the place to go for photographers. Just make sure you have an itinerary for your return to Okinawa, as it’s going to get late back.\nYonaguni and Ishigaki Island are my favorite places – though not necessarily for tourism. There really isn’t much to see at these two places – but they’ve each got their unique charms.\nWe’re not exactly sure why though, we have stayed at 11 and 3 star rated hotels in Naha and found them all to be very clean and spacious. I do agree that there are some that are better than others. I’m pretty sure if we can find you a hotel you can go to bed that night and if not, try to do an exchange – even if it’s the next day if you’re not happy. The other thing you may have to think about is to book a hotel close to airport as you don’t want to waste any time getting to the hotel on your second day there – it’s always so much quicker to be staying on the same end of the island you will be flying to and then you can really make the most out of it.\nIf you’re thinking about buying an island to do that, then maybe head over to these three islands.\nI definitely recommend looking into Yonaguni and Ishigaki – they take hours or a day to get to Okinawa, but I’d say it’s worth it especially since it’ll be sunset when you arrive back at the airport – for us.\nHey guys! I’m planning to visit kyushu (tokyo area) in may. Any advice/suggestion?\nWhat is the best area to stay in? Thanks for the advice! I’m going solo and planning to do a train tour. I hope I get some nice weather during the time I’m there.\nIt’s hard to say what would be the best area. You’re in the middle of some of the most beautiful places.\nBut if I were you I’d try to stay near a city that’s not on the coast. It makes it a lot easier to get around on the train and see the whole area.\nFor someone who wants to be close to nature, you’re better off with the more mountainous areas near Hakone and Nagano. Those are a good day trip from Tokyo.\nAre you a photography enthusiast? If so, stay just south of Nagano around Omachi or Matsumoto, and make sure you spend some time in Nikko – we went last year and loved it."

        "output": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge\n\nIn this post, we explain how to boost the AP (AveragePrecision) metric in instance segmentation. We'll show you how to incorporate knowledge of the type of objects present within your scene along with object-level semantics into the detection model to improve detection performance. We'll do this by adding image-level class labels to the training process. First, let's cover a brief introduction to instance segmentation, and then we'll go into specific details for training an instance segmentation model.\n\n### The basics\n\nInstance segmentation is the task of detecting objects and then separating out the foreground and background pixels associated with those objects. Object detection is similar, but the goal there is just to assign object category labels to regions of the image that a specific object belongs to. For instance segmentation, which is the topic of this post, a single object has more than one label: one for the whole object, and another for each pixel inside it. The first task that an instance segmentation model must do is tell, which object the detected region of interest belongs to. To achieve this, it's necessary for a model to be able to distinguish which pixels belong inside an object with a specific label and those that don't.\n\nFor these reasons, instance segmentation models use fully convolutional networks (FCNs). The second task for the model is to classify each detected region of interest into an object class. Once the model is trained on a certain dataset, the output is a heatmap for each object in the image. This is useful because it's a useful source of human knowledge. Given a certain image, for example, the model may not know that a man is a person. However, in practice people can easily understand that in the image below, the person on the right is the man.\n\nFor model training, the image- and object-level labels of the data are used alongside the ground truth segmentation maps. Image-level classes are binary and represent whether a given image contains an object or not. Each object can have many instance-level classes. Thus, a dataset may include 10 object classes and 100 instance-level classes. When training in the following section, each instance-level class corresponds to a feature map in the model, and all the object-level classes are used to label all the examples in the dataset.\n\nIn this post, we'll discuss two approaches:\n\n  * The first one adds only object level labels to the training process\n  * The second one uses object-level labels AND instance-level labels\n\nTraining with object-level only labels requires a much smaller dataset because it doesn't require as much human knowledge as the second approach. But both approaches can be used to detect novel objects that aren't in the training set. The first one is much less effective at detecting new objects in the data set because it relies on the object level labels alone. The second approach is great at detecting new objects because it uses image- and object-level labels to do so.\n\nIn this article you'll learn about the following topics:\n\n  * Object mask prediction\n  * Using bounding boxes to segment object masks\n  * Adding image class and instance-level class masks to the training process\n\nNow, let's dive into the details.\n\n### Object mask prediction\n\nThe first thing you should know about instance segmentation models is that they are completely incapable of predicting the type of object that are in an image. For example, imagine a trained instance segmentation model is tested on an image with a person and bicycle. It would not be able to know that a bicycle is an object. The same is true when you have two different objects that look very similar. For example, an instance segmentation model wouldn't be able to tell that a bicycle is actually a trike. Because of this ability, instance segmentation models are really useful in situations where a lot of objects are very similar to one another. For example, for medical use-cases, it is important to predict the region of an image and not just the type of object in it.\n\nThis is why instance segmentation models don't rely on semantic information. Semantic information is the ability for a model to understand the meaning/category of an object-in the example below, the person class is the important one to understand. These models use a method called _mask prediction,_ wherein they create a segmentation map for each object in the image, which can be seen below.\n\nA mask prediction map contains one contiguous 2D set of pixels per bounding box for each object. Notice that there are 100 pixels overall and 14 classes. Each of them denotes a feature map. Some example maps for different object classes are shown below:\n\nA contiguous set of pixels"

        "output": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking: Why do some of your respondents say they have had inconsistent/contradictory thinking? Why are they the “most” ideologically polarized? (And the rest are a little ideologically polarized, for that matter).\nWe see the most consistency and ideological thinking and the least in those in the conservative +20% bracket because conservatives have the most to worry about in this era of left-wing anti-family bias. In fact, those who feel that their beliefs are most “incompatible” with those of social liberals are those who feel most threatened by the modern ideology. They are most likely to see the world as a war between “them” and “us.” Those with less polarized views, those with similar views to social liberals, have fewer ideological views. Of course, the data also confirm the “culture wars” theory of social conservatism which is quite strong.\nI could go further into individual issues like abortion, marriage, gun ownership, etc. but I don’t think I’m adding very much.\nWe can see if the correlation and coherence holds even out by the group:\nAnd the pattern holds with both the self-described conservative and self-described social liberal (or liberal-socialist in our terms) groups (see how strong the correlation is in Figure 2 of the linked report).\nIt is also possible to examine the influence on these individuals of their social media and media and information environments.\nAnd we see a correlation in Figure 6 of this report that is strong on both the left and the right; that conservatives who use more media have more partisan thinking; that the same is true for social liberals.\nSo the issue is not primarily “the media” (which I believe is true because the Left is not only anti-conservative but also anti-media. They want to turn both into mouthpieces for their own political ideas). The problem is, as our poll makes clear, a strong correlation between media consumption or, as we also see, social media usage and ideological thinking, and the strong cultural and political divides in this society that exist, particularly on the conservative side. This is not an academic finding.\nIt is not as if we didn’t have warning of both these phenomena already. The question is only now how to act on that warning. There are some steps that can be taken:\nI have discussed for years now what I believe are useful first steps, as outlined here.\nIt was not too long ago that many conservatives believed it was the job of conservative foundations to do better when it came to understanding and addressing the impact of media and information on the public sphere. It is likely that now that a majority of American are conservative that the conservative media landscape will undergo a similar change with the right-wing media environment. To what end is unknown. But it would be in everyone’s best interests for conservatives to work on the conservative side.\nThe Right’s media, information and media environment must also change to better serve conservatives. I outlined some of the specific things that could be done here. But to do this, we have got to do a “hard reboot” of the Conservative media, information and media environment.\nWe, at the WPA, have published a number of reports over the years on the American Conservative Media landscape and on the state of the conservative debate in American life. Here are some:\nThe American Conservative movement: How to bring them back\nWhy the American Conservative Movement needs a rebirth, A proposal.\nThe Rise of the American Conservative Movement: The Reagan Era\nThe American Conservative Movement: 1978 through 1981\nThe American conservative movement in 1980, A preliminary analysis\nConservatives in the news media: A preliminary analysis, 1979\nI could, but would rather not, go back and rehash these old reports. Instead, I will say that all of them are relevant today. But the American Conservative Media landscape must be reborn. The American Conservative Debate needs a rebirth.\nConservatives think for themselves. We need a new conservative media, information and media environment that will serve them. It is time to do so.\nTags: American Conservative Movement, conservatism, conservative ideology, conservative media, conservative media environment, Conservative Policy Forum, conservative theory, conservatives, Inconsistent thinking, ideological consistency, ideological polarization, ideology, left-wing bias, left-wing media, media environment, self-censorship, social conservative, WPA\nPosted in Conservatism, Media, News Media, Politics/Legislation | No Comments »"

This idiom is used when someone looks at a tree and sees something that they believe symbolizes something about themselves or the situation theyre in.\nThere are two primary functions for trees: producing food for themselves and other living things, and providing shade and habitat.\nTrees provide windbreaks which regulate temperature and prevent freezing in spring and autumn, prevent the wind from reaching a cold house with their branches providing shelter and protection against rain and driving hail.\nWrinkled bark. The red cedar, also known as Judas Tree, has a distinctive bark that resembles the skin on a grape, giving it its alternative name of Judas tree. The bark of the acacia tree is also warty and wrinkled, and turns to a bright orange colour in the autumn.\nThe oldest living tree is a redwood. It is over 600 feet (180 meters). It is in the redwood forest in California, USA.  Most trees grow very slowly, so they can live for a long time. But, a tree can live really long. Some reach over 1,000 years old!\nThe worlds tallest tree is a giant sequoia.  Its height was measured by taking a two-way level of the trunk with a laser beam and shooting the beam up to a point in the canopy approximately one-quarter of a mile away.\nTHIS IS INTERESTING: Best answer: Is plant science hard to study?\nA banyan tree is the largest type, reaching 75 meters in height.

        "output": "Tell me something I don’t know: the name of my dog! But I’m a good man, really. I don’t know how, because I’m not rich (though God knows, I work for it), but I like to help people. I like to do small things for my friends. I help whenever they need help, you know: give them rides when they don’t have cars, invite them over for dinner, send them notes of sympathy when someone’s sick or dies, invite them to my parties, call them when they’re on vacation or out of town. I go to church; I volunteer in my kids’ schools. I’m a good guy.” “What was your job?” the cop asked, changing the subject. “I’m 55. What else can I do? I drive a school bus. It’s good money. I make a lot more than most people. And I’m not a high schooler.” He laughed at that last one. “I’ll be here till I die, probably.” He grinned and stared at me to see what reaction he would get, not just to the last comment but to the whole confession. I have no intention of getting close to this guy. “Tell me something more. Why did you get so angry at her? You didn’t think she was making enough noise?” He shook his head, looking down. “I was just pissed, I guess.” He scratched the top of his arm. I watched him carefully, thinking about what to do next. My gut said that although this guy was lying to me, he wasn’t lying because he wanted to lie. He was lying in order to protect someone or to protect himself. That’s my gut. “Who would you be protecting?” I asked, watching the kid’s face, waiting for the lie to show up. Nothing. His face remained perfectly neutral. Then we had a pause, where he did not speak. Again, I don’t know if he was holding back a response or if he was thinking, but I had an idea. “Who do you think killed her?” I asked. He looked surprised, a second’s hesitation. Then he responded, “I don’t know.” “Why do you think someone killed her?” Now he frowned, looking away, as if he thought he would be betraying a confidence to answer that question. I said, “I’m not saying it’s the same person who killed her. I’m asking about the circumstances of her death. How could someone kill her for all that money?” “I don’t know, man.” “Think about it for a second.” His expression told me that he really didn’t want to. I let him take his time. I put the bottle on his desk. I sat still, not saying anything. He looked like he could wait forever, so I waited too. He sat still, looking down. He was holding a pen inside his left hand, in the middle of his fingers, just above where his thumb would be. His elbows and wrists were on the desk. “Okay,” he said after about four minutes, with a little annoyance. “Who would kill her over her money?” “Maybe they were people who owed her money?” I asked. “And they thought that she was going to pay them and they couldn’t afford to wait.” “Maybe.” I didn’t push. The cop had opened a can of worms and was now trying to deal with someone he knew. That didn’t mean he trusted him, but he was trying. I was trying at the same time. “Does your friend tell you things?” “Who?” “The guy who was the last one to see the lady alive.” The cop sighed. “Okay. One thing I know for sure. She didn’t have one single friend she confided in. Nobody.” “That’s sad, isn’t it?” “Of course it’s sad. But what are you saying?” “He lied to me just now. I know that’s not true. If she were a lonely person, he’d know that.” “He said he was the last person to see her.” “That he is, but he’s not the one who killed her.” He looked down the hall past my shoulder. “I might get in trouble if I talk about this.” “Why?” He sighed, shrugging. He seemed to be giving up already. He said, “Maybe I’m a pawn in something, maybe that’s true.” “What do you mean?” “I’ve been working for the woman for two months. I helped her move some furniture. She wasn’t happy. Then she paid"

        "instruction": "antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called",
        "output": "antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called quasi-omni antennas. An omni antenna (omnidirectional) is one of the most versatile antennas because it can receive signals from any direction. However, because it transmits equally in all directions, they are not particularly efficient and may require more than two antennas to transmit and receive a signal.\n\nAntennas are also made of different metals that are used for conducting a specific frequency. For example, antennas are often made of aluminum and copper, depending on the frequency of the signal that is being transmitted, the two metals have different conductivity qualities. A metal such as aluminum conducts an electrical signal better than another than copper, for example. Aluminum conducts electromagnetic signals better than copper due to its metal structure and its smaller surface area per unit volume. Copper conducts less heat than aluminum, but more electromagnetic energy. Aluminum was used because its surface area is larger than copper, which means that it transmits more electromagnetic energy in the same frequency.\n\nThe second type of antenna is the half-wave dipole. This type of antenna is used for sending and receiving very high frequencies, but it cannot send or receive signals that are very strong, because its conductivity is not comparable to the conductivity of aluminum or copper. Most radio and television antenna used for television and radio transmission are half-wave dipole antenna. The second reason why you might use a half-wave dipole antenna is the ease of construction of this antenna.\n\nHalf-wave dipole antennas are used in many different types of applications. Most cars, boats, and airplanes are equipped with a half-wave dipole antenna, as it is easy to understand that there is a need for an antenna while one is traveling through the air or driving around in a vehicle. As you can see, it is important to have a half-wave dipole antenna because that antenna can be placed in a particular place and can still work with a specific frequency since it operates on radio waves. For example, if you wish to broadcast a signal to another person, you should use a half-wave dipole antenna to send or receive a signal from another device. These antennas do not require a large space in either of the two devices, and can be attached to any device.\n\nA third type of antenna is the quarter-wave dipole antenna. The purpose of this antenna is for transmitting high electromagnetic energy. Because this type of antenna is used for transmitting and receiving a high-frequency electromagnetic signal, it can work with a large number of devices. Quarter-wave dipole antennas can be found in most consumer electronic products. You can find a half-wave dipole antenna in your television, radio, computer, phone, and mobile devices.\n\nAn antenna can be made of different materials that emit electromagnetic signals. For example, quarter-wave dipole antennas can be made of metal or plastic. Although plastic antennas are less durable than metal antennas, it is still important to make sure that the plastic antenna is made of a certain type of plastic. For example, if you are using plastic antennas, it is important to see if the antenna is made of a high-density plastic to make sure that your device is not damaged when the signal is transmitted or received.\n\nA fourth type of an antenna is a Yagi-Uda antenna. This antenna is known for its ability to capture electromagnetic signals from a longer distance than other kinds of antennas. It is important to note that Yagi-Uda antennas are not compatible with all devices that use different frequencies because it is designed only to transmit signals in a very specific frequency. It is important when shopping for an antenna to make sure that the specific type of device that the Yagi-Uda antenna is compatible with. A Yagi-Uda antenna is most commonly used when you are trying to receive signals from a device that is not your own. Because of this, you should always purchase a product from the manufacturer. For example, if you are trying to receive signals from another person's phone, you can purchase a Yagi-Uda antenna from the manufacturer of that phone.\n\nIn the modern world, there are many kinds of antenna that are used for different sorts of purposes. For example, there are antennas that can be used for making emergency calls, antennas that are designed to work with specific frequencies, and antennas that can be used to connect two devices. With these antennas, if one device is damaged while its other device is not, the antenna should be used to connect the two devices."

        "output": "who was the black cabinet member who went on to play an important role in the civil rights movement) and later as a teacher.\nSo, I am reading this story for children that makes me feel sad for the country: “If we ever run out of oil, maybe we should let a man like you get it.” [i’m not getting into this on an oil discussion, just noting his comment.] “Is that what it’s like in your country?” “You may see it. We don’t let you come here except as immigrants.” [The man’s daughter is on the receiving end of an insult.] And then he asks his daughter a question about the man. She gets a lesson about the right path to travel from “Mr.” and then she tells her parents what she has learned. You can google the story, or even read it here. When I read the story, I found it compelling, but also painful, and sad for the country I love:\nWe were raised in an America with a belief system that many of us still find hard to believe. When two strangers met, they gave each other a hello handshake and a bit more. Black or white, they lived the same story. They told their children that they had the same right to speak, study, work and play as all the other children. When we went to church, we sang the same hymns in the same songs.\nThe message was a very clear one: You do not belong to your religion, you do not belong to your country, you do not belong to your race, and you are not confined to your gender when you say that you hold fast to the belief that “all men were created equal.”\nOne of the stories I have heard here involves “the black minister” visiting a white congregation and having his voice amplified through a microphone. The effect was not good on his voice and he was, in a sense, made to sound foolish.\nA pastor whose experience resembled it also offered, “I was invited into the pulpit of a church that didn’t much care for me. They sent me to the back of the church. And they amplified my voice – so they could hear, that way.”\nThe story is in an article by Richard Cohen in the Washington Post:\n[T]he Civil Rights leaders were not simply men and women who had risen up to be citizens but were also people who had become more than that. They were leaders who had been educated, who had been given the tools to lead not just an entire race but an entire nation. And as Richard Rorty, who taught philosophy at the University of Virginia, told us in Race and Love, “the world will either be one civilization or several. The choice is ours.” That is a quote made earlier in this essay: “That is a quote made earlier in this essay:” a reference to Rorty’s observation that some things could not be explained because they were too complex or too small to perceive in a way that made sense.\nHe was writing about love, but at the time, he was writing about segregation and the Civil Rights era. And he was reminding us of the choice before us then and now: Is the world one civilization or several?\nThere is nothing small or complex or too small to perceive about that question.\nYou can read the whole article here.\nBut at last you had come, in spite of your fear of flying. For you knew, he knew, that what came of your love was more important than all the flying in the world.\n“You need to be brave. You need to be strong. You can save this man if you are brave and strong,” he says. One day she just came to the door with a sack of potatoes and began to cook. So I said, ‘Oh Mama, what did you do that for?” [He asked the daughter, ‘Why did you do that?’ The daughter said, “It seemed like the right thing to do.”]\nIt is a message of hope. And of bravery and love:\nIt must have been a very moving experience that was for all of them, especially him but them as well.” [“Especially him” is John Lewis, but it is evident that “us” is also John Lewis and his wife, and is very much a part of the story.]\nSo I thank you, President Obama, for reminding us that we do not have to take anything but what we see for the truth of these times, and that the truth of these times is that there are people of all colors and all nationalities that want these times to be better. I know that we are not always right in what we say or do, but we are people with very good intentions and good hearts from all sides. And I thank you for that and may God Bless you for it. And for the courage and the hope that you have given to all"

The ancient Romans used the Roman numeral system. In this exercise, find out how other societies used some other numeral systems.\nThere are many different ways to number things. A number system is a whole system that contains a group of rules for writing numbers and how to relate two numbers together. For example, a system can be made with just the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9, and the groups 10,20,30,40,50,60,70 and 80. This is called the decimal system. In one decimal system, there are eight values that are related through multiplying them by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10.\nThe number ten can be thought of as a number that you have to add to something to make it a bigger number. Numbers that are related to ten through multiplication are called ten-valued numeral systems. These are numbers that can be represented by multiplying together an element called ten with one of another group. The eight values of 1-10 give eight different ten-valued numeral systems.\nEach of the following systems takes a different number from 2-10 and connects it to ten, so that the set of numbers represented includes the original number as well as all the numbers that can be made by multiplying together 10 and each of the other elements one through 9.\nUse the diagrams to identify each of the systems.\nExplain and describe why each of the numbers that you identify in the system are called the unit of the system.\nSome number systems only use groups of different numbers, but the decimal system is unique in that there are different values for the digits.\nThe number zero is an important value to represent using a decimal system. It represents the number with a value of zero. This may seem strange. Why not use 22 instead? Because in a decimal system that uses groups like 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, and -2, 22 is not part of the whole system, it is a number that is made by the 2 that is a part of 22, plus 10, plus -2. But zero is equal to 0 times ten, and it does not depend on the size of the number 0. This means that the decimal value of the number 22 is 0.\nWhat is the decimal value of the number 22?\nThe decimal system has very small numbers very close to 0 and large numbers very close to 1000. Using a group-based numeral system it is possible to make a smaller decimal system, that is, a system that has values as small as possible.\nFind the decimal representations of the Roman numerals XD, VI and XIXI.\nRoman numerals are group-based numeral systems. In this example, they are based on the values of seven and nine.\nThe number zero in a decimal system is not part of the group 0. In the Roman numeral system, for example, values such as X, the ten, XDDD, the seven and 0DD, the value of nine are used instead as part of a group. Roman numerals are decimal systems.\nRoman numerals are built up using a total of twelve numbers. These numbers are called Roman numerals. Roman numerals are grouped into five groups where the first group of four numbers 1-4 are used for values between 1 and 4, the second group of four 5-9 and so on for each successive groups. Since"

It's not the case of \"one of my relatives tried this and then she did that, I believe it happened,\" then I must believe it. It's not some story out of my imagination. It's based on all the information that's been made available by various government and professional reports, interviews, newspaper stories, and more. My family doesn't have experience with other antidepressants, but this one is different. And it's obvious why it's different.\nIt's different because if you can poison the soil, you can poison the fish, and if you can poison the fish, you can poison the fish eater that eats the fish, and if you can poison that person, you can poison the antidepressant's target, the person who feels the depression they want to treat.\nNow we're at the stage where we are able to prove it not only to the families who have seen it with their own eyes and tried to deal with it privately, but to the government, and to scientists. And if you believe the government does not have an agenda of its own to pursue otherworldly and unearthly means of destroying the planet and humanity's future on it, then maybe you ought to read how we got to where we are today. We lost our planet, remember? Some people do remember.\nWe just passed that 500,000 mark. Thanks for joining me in my thoughts for the last few minutes. I hope you enjoyed them, and I know I took a little bit of time out of your busy day.\nI don't feel as if I have a right to do this to anyone. And I'm afraid that if I don't do it, it's no one's fault but my own. And if I do do it, I have one good reason, maybe two: because I am responsible for my own actions and because, as a poet, I care about words and I care about their effect on people, on humanity, and on its future.\nI just hope, by giving voice to this warning, that I can help people understand that this is no joke. It seems to me that when people say \"It's no big deal\" or \"It's such a little thing,\" they don't realize what they're saying, they don't realize what they're not taking seriously. To people who are living it firsthand, it's not a joke, and it's not a little thing. It's something that affects the whole of life on this planet. And, even through our bodies' and minds' resistance to this form of poisoning, it's taking over and changing us.\nIf you've listened to this far, I would like to hear from you. How has this affected you?"

        "output": "Draft a ministerial speech outlining the top five benefits that innovation brings to the Australian economy. Use as many relevant examples as you can.\nIt should begin with a key message about the economic and national security benefits of innovation and end in a key call to action.\nThe answer should be presented as a single document with a well-structured introduction and ending. You are only required to present what are called the Main Points. That is the structure, the layout, the font, the format and the typography are all up to you. Just remember to maintain the page length.\nIn some jurisdictions the answer can be up to 15 pages long. You don’t have to worry about that in Australia. You have 4 pages to play with. In your preparation, don’t worry about making it look lovely, just make sure it’s all there.\nWhat are the key messages?\nYou would expect the answer to have six to eight key messages.\nSo which topics to choose?\nThe first is the economic impact and the second is the national/security security impact.\nThe best place to start is with the recent Innovation and Science Australia review. The Government has committed to the recommendations in this report.\nSo, you could start by talking about the fact that the review was commissioned because of the need for “rapid and fundamental change”, “sustained structural change” or because we need “to seize the opportunities emerging from new technologies”.\nWe need to talk about the economy and how innovation can help lift it? You could talk about creating 5,000 new export companies over the next 10 years, as the Prime Minister’s office has announced.\nYou need to be able to include things like the fact that the average age of your audience is 31, with only 20% aged over 50 or 60. You need to have facts and figures from the review in your briefing to the Minister, to ensure you cover this important demographic.\nYou need to know that two of the six points of the ISA’s Innovation Strategy are on “innovation support for the workforce and “the innovation pipeline”.\nYou need to know that one of the eight points of ISA’s strategy is to deliver “increased funding and support for education”.\nSo you could also talk about the fact that 8 million Australians do not have a degree. Most of them would like to work with STEM.\nThe other thing to remember is that although we all have cellphones, that doesn’t make us all digital natives. Just 28% of Australians have internet access at home or work. Even just the 12% who have “fast broadband” access at home would like to work with STEM.\nWe can’t talk about innovation without mention of the future of work.\nThe government wants to “ensure Australia’s labour force is prepared for the future”.\nIn this case, they want to see job shifts to more innovative and creative sectors, such as science and technology, research and design, education, and the arts and media.\nYou should know, Australia has the sixth most female-dominated workforce in the world, with 49.9% of women participating in the workforce. You could also know that only 18% of tech positions in 2017 were filled by women.\nSo while you might want to talk about how much we value diversity, this will mean that you will have to make sure you cover the under-representation of both men and women.\nYou also need to talk about how the “global economic slowdown, rising real wages, and the low Australian dollar” has contributed to job loses in other sectors, so it’s important to “move away from an over-dependency on sectors such as mining, manufacturing and agriculture” and develop more emerging growth sectors.\nIf we can’t do it here, who can?\nOf course, you need to know the impact of innovation in other countries and to talk about their successes.\nYou should know that the USA is ahead of us in many sectors that could be enhanced by innovation. Our competitor countries also seem to be more supportive and have larger research, development and innovation budgets than we do.\nIt is great that in the Australian Government we have a leader who values innovation and wants new ways to grow our economy.\nIt is also good that they want technology to be a part of creating a fairer Australia, to help people with disabilities and in remote areas, to create smarter cities and smarter ways of doing things, and to ensure we are one of the most innovative countries in the world."

        "output": "Is online casino legal in India?\nThe Indian Government did not allow online casinos to operate legally in 2000 and 2001, but it gave a green signal to the activity in 2019 after passing The Interactive Gaming and Online Sports Betting (Online Gaming) Act. The move helped in setting up online gaming platforms and sports betting sites inside the country.\nOnline casinos with a license issued by any legal governing body like Gibraltar Gambling Commission, Curaçao Gaming Control Board and Malta Gaming Authority are allowed to accept Indian players.\nOnline casino games are subject to applicable taxes such as income tax if a player spends more than ₹10,000 per year.\nIs online casino gambling legal in India?\nThe Interactive Gaming and Online Sports Betting (Online Gaming) Act 2019 is a law that is responsible for online gambling in India. The act does not ban online casinos in India as they are legal at least in certain geographical regions. The online casinos that are in operation in India do so through the online gambling license that they acquire from an online gambling license issuing agency, such as a gambling license issuing body of India or an external one that offers their services outside India but is recognized by the Indian government, such as Malta Gaming Authority. In addition, the online casinos that provide Indian casino games also need to acquire the Indian casino license.\nThe country is now open for online casinos, and more than 200 gambling sites have operated in the country. The online casinos that have been operating in the country have provided various benefits to Indian players, including their Indian deposit options, currency conversion, and support in Indian language websites. The players of the online casino websites can also use their Indian debit and credit cards to make their deposits, as many online casinos have started providing various banking options to their Indian players. Apart from the aforementioned factors, the online casinos have provided their players with various options for cashing out, such as the cash app and other mobile banking apps. The online casinos also provide their Indian players with many other options, including the ability to use their debit and credit cards for making deposits, the ability to use their bank accounts for making deposits, and an option to use the e-wallet for making deposits, all of which help make playing at the online casinos in India much more convenient.\nWhat is the age limit to play an online casino in India?\nThe online gambling websites operating in India have different requirements when it comes to the age of their Indian players, although many of them require their Indian players to be at least 18 years old.\nWhat languages are online casinos using in India operated in?\nAn interesting aspect of online casinos in India is that they offer their services in more than 20 different languages, including Punjabi, Assamese, and Bengali. But most online casinos are either in English, Hindi, or both.\nIs online sportsbook illegal in India?\nAt the moment, India does not yet have an official online sportsbook provider.\nWhat are the best online casinos in India with bonuses?\nYou can find out about the best online casinos in India, with bonuses, over at BestCasinos.com.\nWhat is the 2019 Act?\nThe Interactive Gaming and Online Sports Betting (Online Gaming) Act 2019 is Indian legislation. This law regulates the sports betting and online casino industry in India. It was signed into law by the Indian President in 2019 and it entered force on January 2020. This law allows the government of India to issue licenses to online casino operators.\nWhat type of online casino games are available in India?\nYou can find a complete list of all the online casino games available in India over at BestCasino.com over at BestCasino.\nDo online casinos work in India?\nOnline casinos do work in India. The 2019 Act permits the government of India to provide online gambling licenses to online casino operators, so yes, online casinos work and operate in India.\nHow do the online casinos work in India?\nIf you want to know more about how the online casinos in India operate and work, you can read more about it over at BestCasino.com.\nHow would playing at an online casino in India compare to playing at an offline casino in India?\nOne of the main advantages of playing at an online casino in India is that you don’t have to travel across the country to play your favorite casino games. You can play your favorite casino games from the comfort and privacy of your own home. Online casinos in India also allow you to choose from a selection of Indian casino games, which you can’t do at an offline casino in India.\nWhy should I play at an online casino in India?\nOnline casinos have several advantages over offline casinos and sportsbooks. However, here are three of the most important:\nThere is no need to travel to the casino or the"

        "output": "I want to eventually become a plant/manufacturing/production manager, and eventually a Chief Operating Officer. What sort of experience and post-graduate education path would you recommend? Please provide non-obvious and atypical career paths leading to such positions, on top of the classic ones.\nHow about someone with an engineering degree that started off in operations in a plant and then became a leader in plant management, manufacturing improvement and then became a director in a manufacturing organization over many years before becoming a VP business unit leader? Did you have a particular role in mind when you asked this question? I’m not able to generalize a good answer without more specifics.\nHi David. What was your position when you worked in the manufacturing plant and what education did you have?\nHi Mike, I haven’t figured much out, yet. I’m about to graduate from college, but am not sure what I want to pursue. I do know I love math and data analysis and may want to do that in an operational capacity. I have a strong background in business classes with no experience in manufacturing. This is the reason I looked for answers. Thank you so much for your help.\nWhat do you enjoy doing? Most people in this situation try to take advantage of their academic strengths. They’ll seek out the most advanced degree they can get, and then they’ll try to find a job where they can use the skills and knowledge they’ve developed. But the reality is that most companies aren’t looking for that type of person. They just want a worker who is willing to do what they tell them to do, even if it’s very repetitive. Most will want someone with good time management, good communication skills and the willingness to learn the details of whatever they’re doing. Of course, there is no shortage of advice about getting a career in the world of data. It’s one of the hottest jobs. And lots of people have gone back to college to get a degree in data analysis. But there’s no guarantee that getting that degree is going to help. If you need more advice on career possibilities, you should talk to some people you work with. Talk to them about what they work on and ask them what they most enjoy. Maybe they’ll give you some ideas. My advice: try to get an internship or an entry level job in whatever you decide to go after, and then work as hard as you can to get promoted.\nIf you want to work in that area, then you’ll need to learn programming and a little statistics. You’ll need those skills in some jobs, and even in other jobs, you may discover that you’re doing some programming or statistical analysis just to support what you’re doing. And it never hurts to learn some more general skills, like how to work in teams and how to develop and manage a project.\nThank you for your reply. I am not aware of my skills and what I like/dislike doing since I just starting a job where I am using mostly accounting. What do I need to do in order to get that job? Are my skill sets irrelevant or something I need to supplement?\nThere are lots of ways to get started. I was in exactly the same boat 20 years ago. I majored in history and had no idea what I wanted to do when I decided to go back to school after I graduated. I didn’t have any experience in accounting so I decided to study accounting, and I went back to school for another 2 years so I could get my CPA license. When I graduated, I figured I’d get a job where I could start to make some money. But I didn’t want to get a job that was just a way to earn a living. I wanted to do something that I enjoyed. I had no idea what that was, though. But I also figured that I’d get some experience and that would help me figure out what I wanted to do. So I got my first job offer from one of my professors. He was looking for somebody to take care of some accounting stuff for his student business. I told him I was willing to work for him, but I needed money for rent. He took me out to lunch, discussed some of the stuff he was doing and also told me to go on a couple of interviews from his list of companies. They had openings that week, and I took them all. I got 4 offers from 4 different companies and in each one they wanted to pay me the same. And I thought, “Whoa, that’s a lot of money.” So I took the job and I’ve been doing this for 20 years now. I started out working in a very small accounting practice and there really wasn’t much for me to do. But I was learning a lot. I learned how to be good at what I do now and by the time I was in college, I was good at it."

        "output": "Write a story about Anakin Skywalker encountering a Jedi who speaks and acts like a 1920s British aristocrat\nAn example would be this. It was, at best, a rough description of Anakin’s thoughts at the time. I also used all my favorite words and tried to use as few common ones as I could.\nAnakin Skywalker stood on the banks of a river, a light breeze blowing through his hair. The air was fresh and crisp, and his face felt tight from days of uninterrupted sleep. He took in a long deep sniff, reveling in the sweet scent of the rain-soaked earth and dew-sodden grass.\nHe glanced around at the surrounding fields. They were nearly bare because of the weather. All that stood between Anakin’s feet and an endless wall of brown mud was a single, narrow path to the west. He was at home. The farm from which he had run away six months ago.\nAnd there on the farm-house’s veranda, was the only person he had ever trusted to run away from it. Amidala. Her hair gleamed gold in the bright sunlight, and she smiled shyly as she raised her hands in greeting.\n“Darth Anakin!” she exclaimed, bounding down the veranda’s steps and walking toward him as quickly as her corseted legs allowed. “I heard your name called out as clear as day. I just wondered if it was you. I have been hoping you’d come at last.”\nAnakin smiled back as he took her hands in his and shook them firmly. He then turned his head to look back at the farm in the distance.\n“You came home, my dear?” he said, with a soft and wistful expression.\n“I missed the smell of my family’s cooking,” she said, squeezing his hands tighter, and looking up at him with a playful glint in her eyes. “And I had gotten so bored running down this dark old castle, it made me feel so claustrophobic, I couldn’t wait to get out. I realized I should have come home with you sooner.”\n“Then why wait so long?” Anakin replied warmly, returning her smile with one of his own as he looked at her with wonder.\n“I …” she paused, a hint of hesitation taking control of her voice. “You were busy,” she finally continued. Her demeanor then changed as she put her hands on her hips and scowled at him playfully. “But tell me, why haven’t you brought me dinner?”\nAnakin frowned, as if puzzled he hadn’t. “I did. It’s cold out, remember?” he said, pulling his hands away from her and turning in to the house to find a warm pot. As he walked, he began to wonder about his friend’s sudden burst of affection.\nIt was true they had been good friends, but this was more than that. She was behaving with a certain familiarity- something to be expected between two lovers rather than two close friends. Anakin had always viewed her with affection, but a friendship, a place for the two of them was enough. She had never given him more.\nAs he walked on, Anakin’s frown only deepened as his thoughts grew dark. While he was happy to see Amidala again, he found it difficult to shake the feeling of unease she had given him. He had never fully stopped thinking about her since the day he had helped her escape a fire. She had begged for help, and he had been glad to give it. Yet, it was never the same after that.\nShe had been a constant reminder to him ever since of what he did not have. What he had given up. He could still see Obi-Wan and Yoda glaring at him across the room, and though he had long since moved on from whatever it was they had done to him the day of the fire, it never felt enough.\nThis was not what he wanted. At all.\n“Hey,” Amidala interrupted to his dark thoughts. “Don’t look at me like you just remembered what you did to me and didn’t take into account how my feelings would be. Did you actually forget? Or you just got tired of me crying on your shoulder? Or maybe you don’t want to acknowledge my feelings after betraying us in front of your Master.”\nAnakin paused, his head slowly turning toward her. He stared at her with an expression of shocked surprise, almost as if he couldn’t believe the same voice he remembered hearing so many times was calling him out to her.\nHis face began to redden and his eyes glinted angrily behind his golden, droopy eyelids.

This results in an equivalent travel cost of approx £0.80 per mile, as shown in the figure below.\nThe figure below shows the number of journeys made by different groups of respondents over the last four weeks. If we were to use the method seen above, and calculate the equivalent cost per mile, then based on the data it can be said that the highest paid workers, earning between £12,000 and £15,000 per annum, spend the most money in fuel on travel.\nBased on these findings, you may think that high earners drive a lot more than people who are paid a small amount, but in fact this is not necessarily the case. The next graph shows the weekly distance for cars and the results are very different to the original figures reported above.\nCar mileage in the last four weeks\nInterestingly the graph shows that the highest earners actually drive the least car mileage when you consider the fact that they travel the most in total.\nCar miles per day based on hourly cost of petrol\nThe graph shown below takes into account the time and money spent travelling on a daily basis to work. The x axis shows a full days travel in miles i.e. 16.\nThe first thing you may notice about this graph is the relatively similar time spent travelling in all the groups. The second thing you will notice is that the high earners have the lowest travel costs, with less than the average cost. However, the high earners travel less than the other groups, who travel over twice as much as them.\nUsing this information, if you are a high earner and you find yourself in a car, where the cost of an hour driving is equal to or below the cost of an hour sitting on the bus, then it would be sensible to stick to the bus to save money. This way you will also be doing your bit to help the environment as buses emit around half the pollutants as cars per unit time.\nCar-drivers-and-travel costs"

The boundary of those elements is called the nodal set.\nb)The element class (the finite element being just a special case). Elements can be triangles, tetrahedra, hexahedra or whatever. There is no nodal set.\nIn the reference book \"Finite Volume Methods and Applications\" by F.P. Brebbia&G.J. Dyer one can see, how the method is explained.\n\nA: You might start with the textbook \"Finite Elements for the solution of partial differential equations\" by Brebbia, Dyer, and Levecq, published by the A.R. Press company. \nTo get started, you definitely don't need an in-depth mathematical knowledge, but you should be familiar with differential geometry, and know a little something about multivariate calculus. \n\nA: I think that you are getting confused when you start looking at finite volume methodology. The finite volume method (FVM) is used in problems where conservation laws are satisfied (e.g. flows) and the discrete method is the EDP method (finite difference). You can get lots of information in the Numerical Recipes book, a standard for anyone in applied mathematics doing work in numerical computations. Chapter 6 on \"Computational integration and differentiation\" should give you a good overview of Finite Difference. As to your question about the FE method you are using the EDP method to discretize and then you can solve the problem by making the discrete problem into a finite volume problem and you are using the method of lines. If you still want to consider more you can read a technical reference that will help in understanding. Here are some papers that I recommend.\nAn Introduction to the Finite Volume Method with a Variable Coefficient Advective\nScheme in an Elliptic Equation\nThe finite element method for convection-diffusion problems\nThe Finite Element Method for the Poisson Equation"

What are the main features of each of these classes of firms\n1. A typical firm offers goods and services that vary in quality, and faces competition from firms in the same industry.\n2. A typical financial firm is usually very large, and provides its customers with a limited range of financial services. Typical examples are banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies, investment banks, mutual funds, and rating agencies.\na) Banking\n1) Banking is the process of accepting deposits and making loans.\n2) The deposit-lending process is typically arranged through the use of bank accounts. Bank accounts are like a bookkeeping ledger. The bank provides a record book that keeps track of the bank’s holdings plus other information, such as amounts of deposits made and loans extended. The customers have their own deposit and loan accounts.\n3) Financial intermediation can be described as the process by which a bank converts monetary and other assets into financial services.\nb) Broker-Dealers\n1) Broker-dealers are financial services firms that typically specialize in making securities transactions for their customers.\n2) These securities include stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds, and futures.\n3) Brokerage firms do not offer investment advice to their clients. Instead, they earn a fee for making securities transactions for customers.\nc) Insurance Companies\n1) Insurance (or insurance and annuities) is the process of making economic transfers between people. The primary purpose of insurance is to protect firms or people from losses stemming from uncertain events.\n2) Insurance companies may be either mutuals or for-profit.\nd) Investment Banks\n1) Investment banking activities include underwriting: they help firms go public, and help firms buy back stock or offer debt securities in the financial markets.\n2) They also advise firms on mergers and acquisitions, and on their financing.\ne) Mutual Funds\n1) Mutual funds are groups of investors who pool their funds together to invest in various assets.\n.2. Mutual funds make money by charging fees and receiving transaction revenues.\nf) Rating agencies\n1) Ratings agencies are private companies that classify the financial obligations of companies according to their relative probability of default. Default is the ability of a company to pay its creditors.\n2) When a company is default-rated AAA, investors can expect that the company will meet its obligations. Similarly, ratings of AA, A, BBB, BB, and B are grades that indicate the relative probability of default.\n3) Companies pay the rating agencies a fee for their services.\n3. Define a financial crisis and its symptoms\n1. Financial crises occur when a financial system is so disrupted that the economy as a whole is disrupted. The disruptions in a financial system can be large and take place fairly quickly.\n2. As is normally the case, financial markets in many parts of the world are large and very complex, and their performance is difficult to monitor. Because of this, it is difficult before a crisis erupts to recognize when a crisis is on the way.\n3. Sometimes there is a big sudden change in one or more prices that causes a crisis. But often, a crisis is preceded by various smaller and less severe disruptions. These small disruptions accumulate, and the market becomes unstable and eventually collapses.\n4. To summarize a financial crisis, we can refer to four main symptoms:\n1) An increase in the cost of borrowing for risky firms.\n2) A decline in the market value of risky firms.\n3) A sharp decline in the value of financial assets, in particular the collapse of the price of risky equities.\n4) A sharp decline in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies.\n5. Some people think that financial crises are caused by investors’ irrational behavior. But it is important to stress that even investors can often be very rational, and that most of the time they simply respond to opportunities that the market provides. Many investors behave more or less irrationally on occasion, but they are not responsible for financial crises. Moreover, investors do not operate in a vacuum; they are able to adjust their actions in response to information about changes in the economy and in financial markets. Many times, they are simply responding to information in their environment, and to other investors’ actions.\n6. More often, financial crises are due to what the economist John Maynard Keynes labeled ”speculative bubbles“—where investors become confused regarding investment opportunities and make decisions that cause prices to rise.\n7. Sometimes financial crises are caused by the inability of financial institutions to meet their obligations. When banks withhold or lose money from a depositor’s account, this can lead to a bank run.\n8. But the most common cause of financial crises involves losses that are not anticipated. Because of these losses,"

Tradjumas is a Javanese word that means ‘pattern maker.’\nBatik Tradjumas is an Indonesian technique that involves applying dye and scraping it off to create a pattern for a fabric.\nThe batik tradjumas process dates back to around the 13th century when ancient Balinese court painters used a similar technique to create patterns.\nThe process involves applying a wax coat to the cloth and scrubbing it with a charcoal, wooden or metal tool called ‘tradjumas’.\nThis process creates a rough surface for the dye to adhere to.\nThe dye is created using madder root, turmeric and other plant extracts that give different colors.\nThe batik tradjumas was popularized by the royal court of Sultan Agung of Mataram in Central Java in the 17th century.\nIt was used throughout most of Java during the 18th and 19th centuries.\nIn the 20th century, batik was made using synthetic dyes and commercialized.\nIn addition to clothes, batik tradjumas has been used for shoes, bags, jewelry and other items.\nOne thing I’ll say about this idea is that it’s not very creative, so I don’t think it can compete with other videos on the platform.\nI know batiking is a popular thing to do on Instagram, so I would make a video where you could see the steps of how to make your own cloth, but I know in this video you already know how to make it so it’s not a very creative video.\nThis is the main character in the TikTok viral video about batik tradjumas.\nShe is a young woman who has been using the traditional wax method for many years and has become an expert in the process.\nHer story begins with her childhood growing up among the Javanese people, where she learned how to make batik from her family.\nAs an adult, she has continued to experiment with new forms of batik tradjumas.\nShe has also made herself into a local celebrity by appearing on TV shows and participating in public events where she demonstrates her work.\nOne thing I like about the batik tradjumas video is that it has a strong tone to it.\nIt’s not too serious, but it’s not too cutesy either. It’s just right.\nThe video is filled with humor and is a lot of fun.\nOne thing that I like about the batik traditional videos on TikTok is that you can see people’s faces and bodies in them.\nI know that not everyone likes seeing people’s faces and bodies on camera, but I think that this feature is great.\nYou can look at someone’s face and tell what they are thinking or feeling or even if they’re having a good time or not.\nThis is a video that shows the difference between batik traditions and modern ideas.\nIt starts off with a young woman standing by a table full of fabric."

        "output": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual to help me avoid reacting without thinking in this situation”. When I hear from people about how they have used it in therapy, a recurring experience is clients having the experience of being listened to in a whole new way: to understand themselves and why they are seeing the world, other people, events, or themselves in particular ways, and in which contexts these habits are activated. This helps them to understand all that is not “them”, and all the complexity of the world around them, and how to re-evaluate their ways of being in these situations and their relationships to people, or to what happens as a result of a particular situation/event.\nThe book is beautifully written. Most chapters have a main section, a self-help section, and a section towards the end providing a deeper reflection into a key concept around vulnerability. They also each have one or two self-help assignments and one “take home” practice that helps a reader to integrate all they have been reading into their daily lives.\nI found the book hard to put down, so much so that I’ve been listening to Audible versions of it, as well as reading it from the printed text. The Audible version is especially good. The voice is soothing and gentle; it makes one question where all of the content came from. It is also narrated as a podcast, so one can do other things while listening to the podcast as well.\nIf there is one issue that I have with the book it is that it’s full of information about CBT that is not accessible for practitioners who don’t have extensive training in cognitive behavioural therapy. Of course this is not a criticism, but it does mean I will not know where to go for further material or specific examples. I am sure that there is more in there, though, than would be in a book for therapists and more in what is available online.\nI was delighted to get my hands on a complimentary review copy of Brené Brown’s latest book Dare to Lead. The audiobook was narrated by the author herself and she did a fantastic job, making every page come alive with her inimitable and unique voice. Her storytelling is wonderful, making difficult concepts easily accessible with just her voice, just enough of a pause to reflect and make sense of what they may possibly be.\nOn top of the beautifully crafted stories that are woven into every chapter, and the way she makes sense of difficult concepts for laypeople, one of her most beautiful qualities is how she explains the need for courageous leadership. After explaining how we are all born braver than we believe we are, the author goes on to describe the three ways brave leaders cultivate courageous presence and courageously lead in environments that can be very threatening and toxic. She explains that they do this by cultivating courage that can be felt as a warm heart.\nI found the chapter “It’s a Brave World: The Braver Side to Life” particularly fascinating. Brown describes the difference between how we view the world and how we experience it. When we think about it, we know that people act like jerks and there are no good people, but when we are interacting with people, we don’t see it that way, we see them as human, with feelings and experiences. We don’t expect people to behave in a way that we can’t tolerate, even though we know this to be the case. But then we tell ourselves that if someone is behaving poorly that they have no control, that there is something wrong with them, that they can’t behave any differently, and thus they just can’t do a better job. But to do such a better job, people need the courage to do it. They need to feel safe and to feel that their efforts will be recognised and rewarded.\nI have noticed quite recently that when people fail to see the best in others or others in my workplace, they don’t see why that is a problem, even though they know how they would be reacting. They know their own feelings, but they don’t consider any other feelings or experiences. But everyone is thinking and feeling, and this knowledge doesn’t help us much if we can’t empathise, which is why it is so important to do so.\nI love how Brown articulated the need for courageous leadership in this book. I feel like reading these ideas out loud helps me to understand the need for such leaders. There have been quite a lot of toxic leaders in the last year, so it is time we start paying attention to the characteristics of courageous leaders."

        "output": "is queue an ADT or a data structure that might be used to map from the\nnames of a group to the keys of its members.\n\nAn ADT will be called :term:`collection`.\n\nAn :term:`index` is usually maintained by a :term:`collection` for a given\n:term:`key`, and is a representation of where in the :term:`collection` the\ncorresponding element is stored (along with its :term:`data`).\n\nThe general idea is that you provide an :term:`index` to an :term:`operator`\nwhen it is called, and the index should be used to determine the location of\nthe element in the :term:`collection` for which you are computing an\noperation.\n\n.. _examples/hash_index:\n\nThe Hash Index\n==============\n\nA special case of the above that is particularly simple because it can be\nwritten down by hand is a :term:`hash index`, also called a simple :term:`index`\n(in a slight nod to the idea that it is as simple as a number).\n\n.. _examples/hash_index_operation:\n\nThe Hash Index Operation\n========================\n\nHow you use it is simple.  The :term:`hash index operator` is specified by a\npair of integers for :term:`lookup` and :term:`compute`.  The former\nrepresents the position in the :term:`collection` from which to look up\nthe result.  The latter represents the number that is computed using that\nlocation.  The operation that this produces is generally known as a\n:term:`multiplication_by_one` or a :term:`lookup-from-collection`.\n\nHowever, there is also a generalisation that is called the\n:term:`multiplication_by_two`.  This is called a :term:`multiplication` in\nfact, an example of which is a multiplication 0 or a sum.\n\n.. _examples/d-ary-trees:\n\nD-ary Trees\n===========\n\nA special case of the index is a :term:`d-ary tree`, a :term:`tree-index`.\n\nThis is more interesting to work with than a :term:`hash index` because it is\nthe basis for many modern algorithms for sorting: quick sort is a d-ary tree\nversion of quicksort.\n\n.. _examples/d-ary_index:\n\nThe D-ary Index\n===============\n\nA :term:`binary tree index` represents a :term:`d-ary index` of size `d`.\n\nThe following figures show the structure of a :term:`d-ary tree index`.\n\n.. note::\n\n   In order to make the figures clearer, each edge is represented by a\n   single line.  However, to represent a complete representation of a tree\n   you need to draw in at least two lines, one to the left of the node, and\n   one to the right.  For example, this is what the following figure\n   :numref:`figure_examples_d-ary_tree` would look like.\n\n.. _examples/d-ary_tree:\n\n.. _fig_example_d-ary_tree:\n\n.. figure:: figures/d-ary_tree.*\n   :width: 50%\n   :align: center\n\n   D-ary tree index.\n\nTo lookup an element, find its :term:`index` (which is a value in\n`binary_num_to_col_pos[key]`.  Then find the `d` bits in tree index that\nhave that index (and use :term:`bit_array_and`.  Then use the :term:`compute`\npart to do an operation on the number of bits set to 1.\n\nThis operation can also be performed by iterating through the tree :term:`left <left_index>` to :term:`right <right_index>`\n(as is done by binary search).\n\n.. _examples/d-ary_tree_binary_tree:\n\nA D-ary Tree is a Binary Tree\n======="

        "output": "what are some basics of nutrition that i should be aware of?\nI do not know about all of the details but here are a couple of things that came up in a conversation about nutrition this morning with some folks on Facebook that I thought would be worth posting.\nthe first thing is that nutrition is an incredibly complicated topic and you cannot really get a fully complete answer to any nutrition-related question in one blog post. you should start here and do more research. i suggest you read all the comments which i will post at the end, it's a goldmine of information.\nI think it's important to remember that there is no one diet for all people.\nOne of the most important things to remember is that there's no ONE diet that is suited for everyone. What's most important to realize is that the biggest change in dietary pattern is the change in the type of carbohydrates that you include in your diet [...] The reason for that is that a very large percentage of Americans get more than 50% of their calorie intake from carbohydrates [...].\ncarbs play a very important role in overall body function and they are what keep your levels of energy elevated.\nIf your level of carbohydrates is too low your level of energy will be low and you will likely not be able to make it through the day without missing out on the important and fundamental work you need to do.\nLow carb diets are generally high in fat and protein but they are also high in fiber content.\nWhen we're discussing fiber, we're discussing the non-starchy type.\nThis is fiber that's got carbohydrate content, it's got carbohydrate molecules that you cannot get the benefit out of, and that doesn't mean it's unwholesome.\nIt just doesn't give your body the benefit that is going to be best for your body, so if you want to increase your fiber intake, look for the non-starchy type.\nNow if we're talking about eating more and more fiber, the more fiber we eat is great, we're eating plants, and if you're eating fruits and vegetables you are eating more fiber.\nNow you can't get 100% of your carbohydrates in from plants, so ideally those carbohydrates will come from something that is green, and it comes from something with a seed. And if you are going to be trying to consume more fiber it is important to go down the list and look at things like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and green, leafy-type vegetables.\nThe second thing to understand here is what type of vegetable oils are best when it comes to cooking and heating?\nThis is something you're going to have some debate about, but I think that for the most part, if you're looking for some of the most heat resistant oils you have a couple of different choices. The first one is olive oil, the most heat resistant of the virgin oils and I think that's probably one of the most popular oils you're going to think about.\nI'm going to talk about coconut oil a lot and I'm going to say it's important to know a little bit about coconut oil. Coconut oil when you heat it over 105 degrees is partially or partially broken down.\nWhat happens is that it changes its structure and it's a bit more of a viscous liquid than it is a solid, and that means it's going to stick to your food and when you heat it over 105 degrees and it's solid it tends to cook with some of the other oils that you're using. So coconut oil is certainly one of the most heat resistant vegetable oils.\nI would say that most people who've used it, it's a great cooking oil, it tastes great, it has a nice mouth feel and it has all kinds of beneficial properties. There's a lot of debate over it, though, because you do have to understand that it has a high level of saturated fat in it. When people say low-fat, they think about saturated fat.\nSo for those of you that try to limit saturated fat, then I would definitely not recommend using coconut oil if you're trying to limit the amount of saturated fat you're consuming, but again coconut oil is probably the one that I would not think of if you're using it for frying or baking or sauteeing vegetables.\nI think that olive oil would be the first choice and coconut oil is probably the second choice when it comes to cooking.\nthe other oils, such as butter and lard are also high in saturated fats. butter is the only vegetable oil that is more liquid at room temperature but, at room temperature and it's very flavorful when it is not mixed with, say, an oil that has a lot of flavor.\nI don't recommend"

No wonder so many people hate links (myself included).\nI would love an in-built search capability when clicking on the \"link\" icon, to allow a user to search for a piece within the content they're viewing, without having to dig out their browser every time.\nThis is probably the biggest obstacle many people face when using Wikipedia, even though it's available at the top of every article. You can find a lot of good content out there on the web that Wikipedia don't host, and having to dig deeper to find pieces that are relevant to your needs takes time and effort that could well be better spent elsewhere.\nWhen it comes down to it, I can spend 20 minutes going through a Wikipedia article. There's only so much time in a day.\nIn my opinion, the idea of the Wikipedia article is to find a relevant piece on the topic and save it to read later. When a user clicks on one of those icons, they should be able to find the information without the extra effort and time.\nI know Facebook is a different beast altogether, but how difficult would it be to link to a relevant page in that context too?\nWith an in-line search, and the ability to save a piece of content for later (or in the \"reader's choice list\" or whatever it's called in Facebook), you could use the Facebook platform to keep users engaged in something they're reading elsewhere."

At some point their child might start school and after a while they move house, and on the move, perhaps they get a new car which they love.\nHowever, 10 years down the line, what they love is, perhaps, not the same and therefore not something they use on a daily basis any more, yet it might even be a car.\nI'm trying to come up with fun examples of funny current circumstances, and the person/people who are the most likely of all to get/have that future example (the person who 10 years from now would take a funny scenario which they, themselves, could be in).\nI was wondering if you could give me a few examples that you can think of, please?\nI don't mean you have to write complete scenarios about them. I just think you can give a brief scenario where a person could be in the future and the person who you think would be most likely to be there.

It's just the general direction he's making his life go in that I am saying here. But you're right, he could still be there in 10 years to come, someone else might too. So maybe what I need to do is make Tim more specific? I'm thinking maybe I need to add some 'stuff' to this as well.

It's really sad when someone just doesn't get their way anymore.\n– aaron\nDo you mean you are in a position where you know 10 years from now in detail about some people who are not even yet alive?\n– bof\nMy first thought has been in 10 years you find yourself in hospital after a brain transplant operation, and you are there with Tim but he is still eating snacks bought from that small coffee shop. Perhaps it was the coffee shop where you found out you were going to have all those problems, and you had to travel 10 years into the future to perform the operation.\n– David Richerby\n@aaron - yes I have done a little bit of reading up on these so I know quite a bit about them :)\n@aaron - they might not be able to get married and the marriage might soon end, but there is a good chance that Tim is going to start a family and he will stick with the coffee shop for the snacks.\n– Johan C\n\"The circumstances must be funny yet respectful and safe for work.

The song might be about the fact that I hate everyone except for God, which is not very loving at all, but we’ll just let that one be. I do love Jesus, I just haven’t been very good at acting like it and taking time to understand what loving Christ means. That is one of my primary goals this year, so this song is a start. I do pray, I’m not like Pastor Paul Crouch or those other “Christian” televangelists. But it’d be nice to learn some more (a lot more) about jesus. I think what I’m writing is something of a confession / prayer of sorts. I just thought this might be a good place to try that song out. Hopefully it’ll start a conversation on these topics, and maybe I can learn from someone. “I am just a weary traveller. In need of a place to lie down rest…..”\nI remember writing this song for a friend, and she liked it a lot. She used to play it on her guitar. She no longer knows that song or I. But I’ve always had it. I’ve played it on my guitar quite a bit in the past years, and I really like it. A lot. It’s a simple song, but I actually think it is quite good. It’s a story song, like the first three songs of this release. I think it is in a key you haven’t heard yet. I think the guitar playing is pretty cool, and the lyrics are a good story of someone at work, who is being ignored and mistreated. Most of us have been there at some point in our lives, and I think any song that can express those feelings and offer the remedy to feeling like that is a pretty cool song. I hope you like this one too. Thanks for listening. “I was working my job, not that hard. I just wanna be somebody’s child.”\n(This little tune is a part of “Piano Stories Volume I”. If you have no idea what that is, get it. It’s a collection of some pretty cool originals that we recorded at 479 Productions in Athens, Ga. I thought you might like to hear that, but I guess there are just one or two more songs that were recorded there that I could release.)\nThis is a fun little song. It’s sort of a prayer song. It might sound a bit spiritual, but it’s really just about my attempt to sort of pray by playing the guitar. I thought I might try a few things that I don’t usually do when I play, and see what sort of effects that might have. I don’t think the song is very good or anything, but it was a fun experiment.\nThat’s as much as I got. Hope you like this batch of tunes. Thanks.\n“I am happy when the world goes black. All your pain and your guilt, I will take. I have no place to go.

That’s me. I’m playing the piano by myself. But I play in this way that I’ve developed over the years, that isn’t like a standard piano style at all. There isn’t really much rhyme or reason to it. Some songs, like The Beatles songs in (most of) “Volume I”, are very close to a standard style. Others, like this first song, are almost completely different from the way those songs were recorded. I thought there might be a few different sounds I could try, and I think it all turned out to be a good idea. I thought these songs could give you a little insight into where I’ve been over these last ten years or so. I think there is a lot of difference between the early years and the later years in my life, but there is also definitely a certain continuity too. I think this first song sums up both ideas pretty nicely. There is a very clear line in time between the very early sound I used in these songs, and the"

So, today for some reason (probably because I’m tired, but not sure), I thought it would be amusing to write up a series on all 6 albums from Nelly Furtado. Since this is the last in the series, I’ll keep any new information to something like this:\n“I was a fan of her debut album, as I remember listening to more of the tracks on it (that I didn’t already know) than the other more recent singles like “I’m Like a Bird” and “Turn Off the Light” (as she’s come back and done with “Maneater”). I’ve also heard she had a relationship with The Game, so that might be the actual reason they both made appearances on this album.”\nSince this time period was also when I was really getting into hip-hop, I definitely heard some of this album when out with peers of mine and even got a chance to see her perform it live. However, I think my favorite Furtado track is probably their second single with The Game called “Promiscuous”, as it was a song I could hear when in the car with a friend and she didn’t seem to mind it. But, since most people have probably heard it before, I chose their last single “Maneater” over the years to talk about.\nThe song that originally got me into Nelly Furtado\nThis song came out in 2006, and is the second half of an interlude called “Reverse Piggyback”; it then plays out into the first of several singles on her (now critically acclaimed) third album, Loose. “Maneater” is the most well-known song off the album, and really has all the makings of something to be a top 40 pop song. I first heard it when it came out, but I didn’t quite appreciate it back then. This wasn’t because of anything else, obviously,"

        "output": "question about Computer architecture and organization \nfor 6 marks\nwhat in general terms is the distinction between computer organization and computer architecture ?\ngive answer in full sentence points if possible\n\nA: A computer's organization refers to its structure, while the architecture refers to it its specification.\nTake the Apple 1 for example.  On the \"organization\" side, it had a CPU, an interrupt, some RAM, and the keyboard.  On the \"architecture\" side, it had a 4 bit CPU, 8287 interrupt controller, 16K RAM ($9600), and a 3279 keyboard.\nSource:  http://j.mp/app1intro\nThe key difference between organization and architecture is what we can actually read and/or re-implement.\nSee the OVERVIEW OF COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE article for more discussion and background.\n\nA: I assume you mean \nfor 6 marks\nWhat is the distinction between computer organization and computer architecture?\nThe main difference is that computer organization means what's internal behind the scene in the computer to do the actual computing work, (ie the implementation.) While the architecture is the description of how the computers are constructed internally, (which includes both internal implementation and how to deal with external access). \n\nA: Let's see if I can get into this problem from a slightly different angle. The two main ways that you can structure a computer are sequential and parallel. Parallel computing is the most recent approach, but there are actually two different approaches being taken in the field, and they both have problems. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control \nSequential computers are also getting more complex by adding more sophisticated logic circuits and by adding more functionality.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware\nThe question seems to be:  organization VS architecture\nOrganization is a matter of choice, and a great deal depends on how close to reality you want to design the computer to be.\nThe architecture is the way you design the computer. It may include things like the choice of organization as well as issues of instruction selection.\n\nA: What they all say is correct, but to elaborate a little:\nOrganization - it is often considered synonymous with hardware on which some software operates.\nArchitecture - its a little vague on your request as well, but I would put it thus:  I'd say on an overall structure but without looking at the hardware itself. On a general note architecture is like the high level function of a machine, while organization is the implementation level.\nSo organization is the overall structure, while architecture is the design of all the parts in that overall structure.\nFor example, a RISC processor is a very organization (hardware) specific thing. It's organization is \"there is memory which may be the code, there are the registers of the CPU, there are the I/O ports on the processor and there is some kind of cache.\"\nIts architecture is then like: \"there is an instruction processor, there are eight loads, eight stores and a general purpose ALU.\"\nIt doesn't define how any of that is implemented, it just says that it is.  For that you'd go to the implementation level, which is what organization is."

I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?\nJiro, thank you for showing me the path which guided me to where I am today. Thank you to everyone at San Francisco, and I hope that Jiro and you will follow the path to which you have both embarked on with grace and elegance.\nIt would perhaps be best stated in terms of what the art/praxis of aikido is not: it is not about martial prowess in any form. It is not about teaching or learning about weaponry, or the use or technique of weapons. These are things that should be taught elsewhere, as appropriate to their intended audiences.\nIn truth, the martial side of aikido (what one learns physically while practicing aikido) is of little interest at all as something to study or to teach.\nThe martial arts are of great interest to most people, and I've certainly witnessed students whose primary interest in aikido was to learn martial arts. I've also witnessed other people whose primary interest was to learn self-defense or to learn to defend a friend. In these cases, I think aikido would be a good fit. But I think that we as aikido practitioners need to be very clear about what the praxis aikido ISN'T, if we are to educate people in the true aikido praxis.\nIt is not about learning how to fight in a good way.\nIt is not about learning how to use violence or weapons in a good way.\nIt is not about practicing or being able to kick someone's face off.\nIt is not a martial art at all, in any way and in any manner of speaking.\nAikido is not about teaching how to be violent. It is about how to learn how not to engage in violence, and about how to stop a person who is or has engaged in violence once engagement with that person has begun. It is about how to engage with a person who has engaged in violence in such a way that the violence being engaged in can stop, and who is left free of violence.\nIn the case of teaching self-defense or to defend another person, it is also about not harming that person's sense of self-defense or to prevent them from harming others. This is important to remember. A good aikido teacher will understand how to teach self-defense in such a way as not to create a fear of violence in the student. Similarly, a good aikido teacher will understand how to teach a student to defend a friend in such a way that they will not inadvertently cause harm or suffering to that friend.\nThat the art called aikido is not about teaching or learning to use violence is easily understood. If one were to study violence one would certainly look to the martial arts, for example, but certainly not to this art of aikido. Aikido teaches physical practices that are far from anything that could be termed \"martial,\" and certainly are not about teaching how to use any form of violence.\nFrom a historical and personal perspective, I would like to point out a particular event in my life regarding how I have applied the principles of aikido to my daily life.\nAbout 20 years ago, I met my wife. I knew nothing about Aikido, and I have a pretty thick skin as it is, having been around tough guys my whole life. I can handle myself, but not what I thought was going on...she was getting beat up a lot when we met and we couldn't seem to make it work. I thought I could change things, even try to keep her safe, but I still didn't see her being attacked.\nAfter months of being a doormat, I got it together and asked if she was still getting beat up. She said she was, and I asked her if there was anything I could do. I didn't take her seriously. She asked if I could learn Aikido. At first I thought she was crazy, but then I thought, hey, it was worth a try...I'm tough, I'm a tough guy, how hard could it be? I have two green belts already...she was wrong about that, of course...I was a total newbs at Aikido.\nThe night of my first class, I showed up, and I remember thinking to myself, what am I doing here? I sure don't look like someone who could ever kick this guy! When I entered the dojo, there was this guy...he wasn't a big guy, but in Aikido terms he was"

Howard, and 70 years of training children and adults to support families in crisis. The 6,000 word document was completed in January 2021. The plan lays out a vision for a nonprofit corporation to train people in crisis to support families. The corporation will provide services to non-profit organizations that are supporting families and children in crisis and also to individuals seeking to develop or improve their parenting skills.\nA second critical goal of the group is to build a team of social workers, therapists, marriage and family therapists, marriage and family counselors, psychologists, and doctors to provide professional consultation on how to handle and manage an unexpected crisis.\nThe third critical goal of the group is to create a training program for individuals and organizations to receive training and to become certified under a new designation  Dad-Culturally Competent Parenting & Training Professional (Dad CCPT) and to implement a peer-to-peer mentoring organization for parenting educators who specialize in child and family crisis. This peer-to-peer mentoring organization would offer training, consultation, and support on crisis management and training.\nDwain Meeks\nA fourth critical goal of this group is to make available to people and organizations, both public and private, the resources Dwayne Meeks developed over twenty years called TCPT. TCPT tools are a set of tools that help people understand complex parent-child behaviors in addition to being able to assist people in managing emotions and creating effective and healthy emotional responses and ways that support healthy self-development and emotional well-being.\nDwayne Meeks TCPT training tools can be downloaded free to anyone by contacting Dwayne Meeks. The tools are available, for free, at: https://www.dwaneymeeks.com/tct-instructions.pdf\nThe pandemic has been a time of great uncertainty and confusion for everyone, but more so for parents and students. There has, at this very moment, over 500,000 schools closed. The closures have impacted one-third of all children in America. The closures are causing many children to lose support and connection to teachers, parents, and family members. These problems can be addressed by expanding on a long-term project called Dad Taught, by expanding the model that Dad Taught was based upon. While Dad Taught will likely expand into schools, it is critical that the training in crisis management and support services be expanded. The support programs, PNMCL and TCPT need to continue to be expanded, to reach all who need them not just families but the children who are suffering as their families care for and love them.\nThe Crisis Response for Americas Families  CRAF is the foundation of a series of projects that focus on the needs and problems of families and children who suffer during crisis. The critical needs need to be dealt with and our children and families need to be educated to be able to manage both the crisis situations they encounter but also to deal with the stress that crisis creates for their lives. CRAF will focus on these critical needs and focus on finding the best practices on how to move through the crisis response phase.\nThe main objective is to create an entire family support program that has a Crisis Response Network and a Crisis Management System. The support system will create a training program to assist parents and caregivers who can use their own knowledge and skills, their own personal experiences and professional training, to provide immediate response to a family or parent in crisis. By responding directly to a parent in crisis, they are able to provide immediate crisis support to the family and the young person and help to avoid a more catastrophic outcome. Crisis Caregivers can be trained to be first responders in the family care system.\nDwain Meeks has created, over 20 years, an extensive training program that can be adapted to teach the fundamentals of response for individual crisis management. He has created two programs, one for schools TCPT and the Dwayne Meeks Training Program, TCPT, and one for families the Parenting Curriculum in Crisis, PNMCL. These extensive training programs will assist people and families to manage crisis situations and create a more positive and helpful response that assists families in moving through the crisis response and then moving to crisis management. While there are other response systems out there, the training in crisis management presented in the PNMCL and TCPT programs, will be provided, at a reasonable cost, to anyone who has been trained to use it.\nThe Crisis Response Network, CRAN is a project that uses trained professional, crisis responders, and care-givers who have received training as Dad Taught, Dwayne Meeks Parenting Curriculum in Crisis, PNMCL, or the Dwayne Meeks Crisis Training Program, TCPT.

For instance, when a customer service representative has to respond to a customer complaint, they may be able to take advantage of a saas user survey tool to gather data which will help them determine the best way to alleviate the customer’s concerns.\nA good example of this might be an online tool that allows customers to track their complaints, as well as view the data that has been collected about their concerns, all without having to use any additional resources. Of course, there are a number of other survey tools that could be used for this purpose as well, such as online polls, which would allow the company to gauge how effective their efforts have been in finding and resolving the problem.\nA customer service representative can see the data being generated by the web-based survey tool, and they can determine how much time is being spent on resolving a customer complaint. They may also be able to see a history of previous customer complaints, and they can use that information to help them make better decisions about how best to handle problems that arise in their work.\nWhat Is A Feedback Surveys?\nCustomers are the lifeblood of any business. And the reason why is simple. The customer is ultimately who you have to be appealing to if you want to succeed. It’s a no brainer. What’s even crazier is that you can find this out so easily. All you have to do is ask your customers what they think, or rather the way they think about your business. It’s simple as that.\nYou may ask yourself, “Well, why don’t we just ask customers when it’s convenient for them?” And the answer to this is simple: It won’t work. That’s because, while people do understand that we care, they don’t really want to be bothered when they are too busy to remember who you are.\nYou want to offer your customers a way for them to get in touch with you whenever they want, but in a way that makes it easy. That’s why we’re here to help. We offer a solution that’s as easy to use as it is effective, and that’s our feedback surveys service.\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Feedback Surveys?\nThere are so many benefits to using a feedback survey, it’s hard to name them all, but they are listed below. The most important to note is the first one, which is that feedback surveys can be as simple as filling out one form. Another benefit is that we can offer a solution that can be used on any website, website or app.\nWe can make the process easy by providing a list of survey topics that can be customized for different companies and industries. And finally, the most important benefit that we can provide is the ability to provide a solution that is effective and inexpensive. We don’t just believe that feedback surveys work – we believe that they are a must for any company!\nThe Benefits To The Customer\nOne of the benefits to a customer survey is that it helps businesses create better products by learning what their customers want. This includes everything from menu items to retail purchases. We all know that customer satisfaction is the lifeblood of any business, and we can help you develop a better relationship with them.\nThere are many benefits to a customer survey, and some aren’t immediately apparent to you. For example, it also provides information about your service that can help you improve. And most customers will be happy to take another survey.\nWhat Are The Best Feedback Surveys?\nThe best feedback surveys give customers the opportunity to review and give their feedback on a website that has a section that lets them do this. This is a great way to show customers that you care about their business. Many businesses offer surveys online because they want to get a closer look at their business. However, there are many feedback surveys out there that don’t do this.\nA good feedback survey can help a company find out what its customers think and what they’re looking for on a company’s website. The best feedback surveys also provide the opportunity for a business to talk about its products or services, and find out what customers want.

I'm not kidding. When the government gets in to something \"that is not their duty\", just stop it! Why make a mess that you are going to have to clean up. Just stop it. We are on the brink of war with China because someone said \"It's the right thing to do, and it will make the US look less powerful as we get out of Middle East's\", the result has been that the US is more in a mess because of it - we still do not have all of our troops home.\nWe are on the brink of a climate change catastrophe with other countries, and that is because of the oil.\nGet with the game. Stop putting people in power who have no idea what they are doing, stop using it as a career that guarantees you great wealth (it should guarantee great wealth if done right - but then the people are more into the money than they are into the people, and we do not have money to spend on that crap).\nIt has taken decades to come to the point that we are at - and every single one of those years there was a way to prevent what is happening now - that you did nothing.\nI suggest to make the laws to reduce oil use by about 50% in the next 10 years.\nFor those who want it, find a way to get oil without oil... but if it comes down to it, there's an abundance of it on Earth (and beyond?) so oil is not the end of the world.\nStop this BS now ....\nStop with the BS. Now.\nJ - 12/21/2010 at 00:34\n@Penny Lane 'Is it just me or does anyone else find it hypocritical for someone talking about the dangers of climate change & oil use, then in the same breath talking about drilling in the ANWR?

In other words, hypervisor modules are installed on top of OSS, which act as an interface between hardware units and hypervisor packages.\"..... In a cloud environment, hypervisor software is responsible to control the hardware resource management, which is essential for cloud computing. Cloud computing requires multiple instances of multiple clouds, and hence a single CPU is not enough to implement multiple clouds. Thus hypervisor is essential for management of multiple clouds to utilize the resources efficiently. In a cloud infrastructure, resource management takes place between the provider and resource users. The use of hypervisor has an interface to manage these resources as per the required configuration. The hypervisor is installed on OSS. It has a single version of software and is compatible with multiple operating systems. When the guest operating system is used to perform the tasks of resource management, the operating system of the hypervisor performs the tasks of load balancing.\n\n![VM Ws](URL\n\nThere are two types of hypervisors, the software-based hypervisor and the hardware-based hypervisor. If the hypervisor is based on software, it works as a thin layer over the OSS, and we call hypervisors VMM and VMware is an example of hardware-based hypervisor.\n\n![VM R](URL\n\nThere are different kinds of VMs used in Cloud. Each type of VM has its own advantages. VMs are used in various environments, including the following:\n\n1\\.  \nVirtual machine for desktops\nFor example, virtual machine images are used by an organization to deploy a computer within its network, which is used for running desktop applications.\n2\\.  \nVirtual machine for data center\nThe virtual machine is a type of software tool used for virtualization. If you have a desktop computer (larger than a laptop in size, but smaller than a server), the virtual machine is used on that computer to run applications that are either web-based or database-based. This lets you create a virtual server to run a database-based application on.\n3\\.  \nVM for web hosting\n\nAs discussed in chapter 2.1.1 Virtualization, web servers are another type of virtual machine that is used for internet hosting. A virtual server is run using its own dedicated computer. We call this server a web server. Instead of renting a server, if you want to save money, you can use a virtual server. Virtual servers are available at the cloud provider's site.\n\n4\\.  \nVirtual machine for testing\n\nA virtual machine can also be used to test a website. We have created the above virtual machines under a common virtual server, in this way. It's possible to create a virtual machine that runs just a single page. In this way, the virtual server can be run at maximum capacity.\n\n4\\.  \nVirtual machine for cloud-based applications\n\nIf your business is cloud-based, you can use a VM to run the application without using your own hardware.\n\n#### Hypervisors are Software or Hardware Based\n\nThere are two types of hypervisors: hardware-based and software-based hypervisors.\n\n* Hardware-based Hypervisors\n\nThe hardware hypervisor was based on a separate hardware device. This hypervisor is used to control the hardware and provide virtualized services to the hypervisor. It is also known as a hardware hypervisor. There are many hardware hypervisors to choose from, such as Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware, Hyper V, KVM (Intel Virtualization Technology on x86), Red Hat Virtualization, Open VZ. We have reviewed a few hypervisors in chapter 06.04, Hypervisor Design Principles.\n* Software-Based Hypervisors\n\n\nA software-based hypervisor acts as a software program that runs on the operating system or OSS. It provides management services to multiple cloud accounts. In this way, it is similar to a guest operating system that runs other virtual machines. A software hypervisor is also known as a virtual machine management system. Many virtual machine management systems are available currently, such as VirtualBox, Xen Server, KVM, Virtual Server 2005, Citrix Xen, VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Oracle VM, Binary VM, etc.\n\nHypervisors, including VMware ESXi, are based on a single hypervisor. Hypervisors are installed on virtual boxes. Hypervisors usually have a single version,"

I dont see any logic in that, especially in the case where we see all kinds of evidence and have made great advances in our own technology.\nWhy not just say to human beings?.

Weve got the same genes, the same ability to evolve, live & die\nOf course, Im not saying we shouldnt do anything with it, but it just made me wonder if we would have gone down the same track. Could we have developed to the point of being able to go out and try out whatever we liked, without needing a planet to sustain us for our every whim?.

        "output": "what are african governments doing to improve air traffic connectivity?\n3. in-market connectivity: improving on-ground infrastructure for travel to and from airports\nFor Africa’s airlines, improved connectivity to international hubs is a must for attracting tourist and business visitors, but a significant barrier remains.\nTourism is the continent’s second largest sector after agriculture, and the biggest foreign exchange earner, with arrivals projected to increase by 20% to eight million in 2017 compared to 2016. Of this roughly 20% is expected to be from Europe, and 30% from China – and it is tourism’s growth to which the global industry is likely to turn their attention. However, to deliver on this potential for African airlines, infrastructure to serve international hubs needs to improve.\nThe government of Egypt, for example, has spent US$250 million on a new railway line between Cairo’s airport and the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh, as part of its efforts to turn Sharm El Sheikh into a world class tourism and aviation hub. Similarly, in July, South African Airways announced that it will invest up to ZAR1.5 billion toward upgrading its airport facilities in Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, while Turkish Airlines plans to expand its operations into Tanzania.\nAccording to Jens Bjørnandt, CEO of Danish airport group Global Aviation, if government authorities don’t invest in improving connectivity then the local markets simply won’t support airline investment. “If the government doesn’t support the infrastructure for aviation, then the private sector isn’t going to follow,” he explains. “If it has enough to invest in the local market then it has to invest in its own country. That’s the challenge. The local market will then grow, and once it becomes viable there will be interest in the international market, and then they’ll have to invest.”\nThe lack of in-market infrastructure is also a major problem in East Africa, with many of the continent’s main transit hubs in Africa having to be shared by six or more airlines, including a handful of low cost carriers. Kenya’s JKIA is the most prominent, but at least eight airlines use it as a hub, including a variety of Ethiopian Airlines’ domestic subsidiaries. At the same time, demand in East Africa remains high, including a 19% year-on-year upswinging in the East African travel market.\nKenya Airways’s head of marketing and revenues, Anthony Muraya, says he expects a further rise in arrivals from Europe to the region, and that improvements to their airport infrastructure must coincide with improvements to tourism attractions within the region that can draw business and tour groups. “It’s important to consider the fact that in order to have good tourism, you first have to have the airline which is a critical component of any tourism,” he says. “When you see a tour group coming at JKIA, it is not just one or two people, but it could be 20 or 30 people. So to take good care of them and to treat them well, there is need for good facilities. So the time to improve is now.”\nBut as the East African market continues its rapid growth, the challenge is to make that growth sustainable – which can only be done by improving the airports. The same is true for North Africa, which saw passenger traffic surge by 3% in 2016, to more than 100 million. Many major developments are underway, including the US$1 billion development of GAA – the new airport for the Egyptian capital. The development was awarded to China State Construction Engineering Corporation, and is likely to be the biggest in Africa.\nBut airport authorities need to be cautious, too. In countries such as Angola, with little tourism, it’s unlikely that passengers will come, but high passenger numbers have the potential to damage an airport. Even though JKIA has been in use since 1977, it’s only in recent years that it has become clear that Kenya could take more passengers as an international hub than is currently the case.\nWhat is the outlook for the African industry, and how realistic is the potential of the Chinese, Russian, Indian and other regional airlines, to invest in Africa?\nThe Chinese are taking an interest in African aviation, and the number of carriers that have either emerged or are establishing a presence in the continent is growing. But can Africa benefit from the Chinese investment?\nThe African air transport sector is certainly one that has attracted attention. It now accounts for 8% of global traffic, but that still represents only 4% of global passenger traffic. But the rise in passenger numbers is expected to continue, if not accelerate. By 2027, Africa is expected to rank as the seventh largest aviation market in the world, up from eighth now, with air travel to and within"

Or, you could make the story about a group of tourists who have a weekend to remember on Sylt. Write a story that combines the two ideas. 2. You think you're a great storyteller. Show the world you've got what it takes. Write a story that you really want to read. Don't be content to merely tell a story, show the power of the medium. Make your readers say, \"Wow. How'd he think of that?\" 3. For all those authors who don't give up after your first novel's rejection, there's always that second, third, and fourth one. Now come up with something that you've never done before. No longer afraid of rejection, you write a story that pushes all your buttons. 4. A true friend will stand by you even if you're the worst writer in the world. Write a short story that shows your friend the strength of the bond. 5. It's been months since you sent that unpublished story out. Nothing's come back but rejection letters. Do something to cheer yourself up. Create your own story. 6.

But now that it's time you finally have to tell this story, you're afraid that the only way you can sell it is to try writing something like what you used to write. Tell the story that you always wanted to write and then, if that's your only option, do it anyway. 8. Your writing is getting pretty good. Your stories are being rejected less, rejected often, and your stories are winning awards. You finally feel that you can stop learning how to write, and you can start to teach others how to write. 9. You have been in this world for a while and it's getting weary, tired, and empty. Sometimes, it just doesn't feel worth it anymore. Write a story that gets what writing is all about. There's something in there that isn't just about the words, about money, and about how to get that book deal.

        "output": "What niches are not being fulfilled on the YouTube platform? What do you think creators should be working on?\nRafael: I like this question, because, right now, there are a lot of people that have their own niche, their own style of creating content, but there is no really structure to it. Like, what's the new trends? What's kind of the next thing? When I started out, I noticed how people were like \"Oh, everybody's doing just YouTube. How do I build my business? How do I monetize my business? How can I make my business work?\"\nSo, I think we need to have some kind of structure to it. What is the next thing right? Because as you know, it keeps evolving and changing. We need to have a structure and we need to have the influencers that are really doing something or bringing something different and kind of start building it like from there.\nFelix: That makes sense. So, it sounds like you started the community because you saw that, like you were saying, there wasn't a community and also there wasn't any structure. Now all these people were kind of doing things on their own and it wasn't being organized. So, you kind of came in to create a community that can organize the community and give them goals and you're asking your own community members to become your educators because they've already been on the platform so long.\nWhat kind of educational, educational tools do you guys use to educate your community members? What are your tools and what can your members use to take action?\nRafael: One of the things that I'm kind of trying to push, that I think is working especially with the online community, since a lot of us don't have the time to spend being online or be online all the time. So, I'm trying to push the idea that people can actually use automation. Automate more than they do.\nSo, if we talk about influencers or people that want to learn how to create content that looks more like influencers, you don't have to be like working 24 hours and sleeping for a few hours. Even if you sleep eight hours, do a few hours of content creation, work six-seven hours, seven-eight hours a day. Then have a few hours to relax and sleep and then get up and do whatever.\nBecause a lot of us, not a lot of us but a lot of people can work from home and there is no real structure in terms of when we work and when we don't. So, that's kind of what I'm pushing, is use tools so that we can automate and help you create content that looks like somebody else's, or maybe do something with it, or maybe edit, or maybe do something with all your content that looks like you're somebody else, because, as I said, right now it is not easy at all right. The quality is like so low.\nAnd so, a lot of us need to know how to really, kind of create stuff the way that we want to, or we can't make up the time. That's one of the things that I'm trying to do, is make that community and the people in there are so willing to actually share the stuff that they want to with everybody else, because, right now, we're so busy. We have a lot on our plates, and the community is there to support all of us.\nFelix: Yeah, that makes sense. I think that also, the other way to do it is to make the product that you want. Make the kind of products that you want to either use, if you're the creator, or that you want to consume, if you're a buyer. When you make your own product, you also have you're not in the direct competition of anyone else, but you also have more things that you know can work and can help you to further your business because you've made it yourself.\nSo, you mentioned that it's very difficult to make your YouTube channel look like an influencer or other people's or a bigger business channel, larger business channel. What would you say, if somebody is listening in and they want to know what that is like, what are some things that they can use or some things that they look out for, or you also kind of pointed to this stuff before, you recommended some products, and you are using them. I saw on your channel, you're now using the ScreenMaster screen recorder, and how are things like that can help a creator like you to help them become more like influencers?\nRafael: One of the most important things right now is to start with the process that you want to create what you want to create. Everybody and I'm not really saying anybody, everybody has their own styles of creating content or doing things."

How does it feel?\nIf you are obese, you may have a hard time describing your body. It's important to be honest and not be negative about yourself. If you are being attacked on the internet, you should not use their words to describe yourself. There are other ways to describe your body and how it feels.\nHow tall is a normal man vs. woman?\nThere is no set average for a man or a woman. For example, taller men tend to have higher incomes and live longer. Women are more likely to be more educated than men. There are also differences in body types and skin color.\nHow tall does an average American man need to be? How tall does a woman need to be for him to be comfortable? What is the average man's ideal height for a woman?\nThese are all interesting questions, but there is not a \"typical\" answer. For example, men tend to prefer taller women, while women generally prefer shorter men. So what does all that mean?\nThe average man's ideal height for a woman is 5 feet 3 inches. So, if a man is 5 feet 8 inches tall, he needs a woman who is at least 5 feet 3 inches. The average woman's ideal height for a man is 5 feet 9 inches. So, if a woman is 5 feet 3 inches tall, she needs a man who is at least 5 feet 9 inches tall.\nIs one child more likely than another to develop autism?\nResearch has shown that one child is more likely to develop autism than another.\nQuestion: What is an alkaliphile?\nAn alkaliphile is a bacterium that can thrive in an environment with high levels of alkalinity.\nWhat should you say instead of I guess?\nYou should say something like \"That sounds good!\" or \"Sounds like fun!\" These are both acceptable phrases that could help you keep the conversation going.\nAt a football game what are the team's names for kids?\nThe team names for kids are called \"Buddies\".\nWhat is the term for a boy with a short man's name?\nThere isn't a specific term for a boy with a short man's name. But, most boys who are called names because of their name will generally be called \"Mr. Short Name\" or \"Tall Short Name.\"\nWhy are boys and girls called things like little prince and princess?\nThe first reason is because people want to be kind and respectful to children, and the second"

In an assignment, you are asked to identify your responsibilities with respect to the development and implementation of your own project. Your assignment is to write an essay of 500-800 words addressing each of these five statements.\nFor the first (A. 1) of the seven task statements, you will write a paragraph that describes all the business benefits that can be realized by using cloud computing. The second (A. 2) sentence will involve a brief description of two cloud software solutions. The third (A. 3) sentence must present the basic steps of using a Cloud-based solution to accomplish a task. The fourth (A. 4) sentence must identify an obstacle to the use of a cloud-based solution and a solution to the problem. In finalization (A. 5), you must discuss which business problem was more challenging to solve: the cloud computing problem, or the solution. This assignment will be evaluated based on the quality of your responses only.\nA cloud computer, as described by Wikipedia, is a computer network that is composed of remote servers, storage, database, applications, and services. It is an on-demand and self-service model used by customers that provide resources that are accessed through the web and which are usually located in a large cluster of servers across the globe. Cloud computing is comprised of many components that include infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS). As explained in the Cloud Computing Glossary at Cloud Academy, IaaS involves companies renting computing capacity, storage, networking and other resources where there is a need for these resources at a time. SaaS is the ability to provision the use of application software over the internet. And PaaS is the ability to create and host your own application and deploy it on a shared platform.\nIn order to provide cloud services to customers, companies must invest in the establishment of their own cloud infrastructure and cloud security systems. And it must develop skills in managing cloud environments. It is not easy to design systems to manage cloud operations without the experience of cloud management teams. Most of all, companies need the technology to securely manage the application and data in the cloud, as well as managing the overall risk of their cloud services.\nA Cloud-Based Customer Relationship Management Software Solution\nIn addition, there are many types of cloud-based customer relationship management solutions. For example, in recent years many businesses have made the move to cloud CRM technologies. This is because cloud-based CRM solutions have the ability to support any number of users, and because there are multiple CRM offerings available that are designed to offer an array of capabilities that enhance business performance. For example, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a CRM product from Microsoft, and is a cloud service that allows customers to maintain complete customer information in a central location.\nIn contrast, Salesforce.com has been the leader in this market, offering a broad suite of CRM products and services. The company started out as an on-premise CRM solution and gradually added more and more functionality to its product line. For example, Salesforce introduced the Force.com platform that allowed customers to build applications that would live in a cloud-based environment.\nSalesforce CRM is an example of a cloud-based CRM solution that is accessible through a website and software. Customers can interact with Salesforce data using a Salesforce tool via the Internet. This makes Salesforce a more powerful CRM solution since users can create different types of data and analyze customer interactions in real time. The fact that Salesforce is scalable helps companies to be able to use its resource effectively. This is because Salesforce can be scaled out to support the needs of more customers. The cloud-based customer\nAn assignment is a type of paper, typically in a writing class or a discipline such as a humanities or the social sciences that asks a student to write a paper about a particular topic. Each assignment usually asks a particular question and requires a response from the students. Students are then graded based on the quality and content of their responses.\nI did my first-year statistics project on the topic of cloud computing. I felt it was an interesting topic and one that I could easily research. After all, many people today use cloud-based technologies, and the advantages of using them far outweigh the disadvantages of using other types of computing applications. In addition, I felt that the topic of cloud computing would be a good topic to write about in order to get my name out there in the statistics community.\nYou may have heard of the term “digital transformation”. This term refers to a transformation of an information technology organization into one that can be considered a digital business. A digital business is one that utilizes technology in its operations and offers services that rely on digital technology. This transformation is being driven by businesses today having to adapt to today’s fast-"

Here's a closer look at the link you provided: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=%22mouse%20base%22&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3A%22mouse%20base%22\nA. Couch\nThe mouse base is a useful thing to have, but I'm afraid the lack of a mouse ball might be a problem with 3D printers. You'd need a ball bearings inside that would require much more precise work to remove than just polishing them.\nIf you need help removing anything from a plastic item, you can always try removing it with alcohol or a solvent like acetone. Sometimes that works, but sometimes it will actually make things worse.\nI would suggest that instead, you search on the following site for \"mouse base\" and see what shows up. http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=%22mouse%20base%22&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3A%22mouse%20base%22\nA Couch\nThis \"1900\" system is an over-priced 8-year-old-computers. There's absolutely nothing new about it, not even the graphics card. It can be found in used stores for around U$200 - 250\nIt's just a 64-bit version of the 32-bit Pentium MMX with 128MiB of memory - a basic motherboard with some very basic PC components - very weak GPU with 4.53MHz clock speed, 64MiB video RAM, 44.1 MiB RAM - a fairly weak sound card with 16-bit sound and 22.056kHz sampling rate. The CPU clock speed is 75MHz. It can get an upgrade to Pentium II of 650MHz if you want to buy a second processor.\nIt doesn't use DirectX, but still uses the 2D engine of Windows 95/98, and will work with 32bpp/24bpp/22bpp graphics.\nAlso, for some reason, it doesn't use the \"Pentium MMX\" CPU name. Instead, it uses the Pentium II name. So you shouldn't get any info about CPU specs on some websites.\nI bought this computer for U$50. It does not overheat and runs very cool.\nHowever, there are 3 main problems: The motherboard is so weak that it can only use 1GB of memory - it also uses both the SIMM slots - 8MiB of memory will be wasted on both of them (in any case, you cannot use more than 1GB of memory on that motherboard - more will not work); and it uses \"Pentium II\" processors.\nIf you want to make the system more reliable, replace both memory slots with a DDR400 SIMM module (you can buy PC3200, PC2700, and PC2100 modules). I would get the 256MiB one, that can be put on both SIMM slots. However, there are 2x512MiB SO-DIMMs also.\nThe motherboard and the processor are both very old and cannot be updated. However, you can buy a new video card - get a GeForce 2 400MHz GPU (that can be put in the motherboard slot) instead of the included PCI"

        "output": "find a word that represents people reacting to unpleasant events.\")\n\n# **SOLUTION - TYPES OF TRANSFERS**\n\nThe word in the answer choice is \"disgusted.\" I chose this word because it makes direct sense in the context of the sentence and it's a concept similar to the other words that I've seen in the question.\n\nYou'll also want to take note of the answers that were eliminated in each question. If you have trouble eliminating answers, try looking at what the answer choices are telling you. When you're solving in a group and getting stuck, have a teammate help you isolate the word/word/word that doesn't look like it makes sense in the context of the sentence.\n\n# **FREQUENT BUGABOO #2 - FALSE ANSWERS**\n\n**_False Answers_**\n\nFalse answers, as the name implies, are answers to questions that are totally WRONG. You'll get them even if you're very clever and give the right answers, but you shouldn't be getting them.\n\nFor a problem related to transfer, the only way you can get a false answer is if the answer is the same as the original sentence or one of the suggested answers.\n\n# **FREQUENT BUGABOO #3 - NEITHER ANSWERS**\n\n# **SOLUTION - NEITHER ANSWERS**\n\nThere you have it, another question from the test solved. It looks like neither choices A and B really describe what a transfer is, but they do look right. And C is the perfect word for the definition.\n\nTake some time to rest, because there are still a lot of problems to go through!\n\n# **THE GOOD**\n\n**_P.S. If this is your first time going through the following questions, you should review the information on identifying question type and transfer from the previous pages again._**\n\n# **Solution - No Transfer, No Change, No Difference**\n\nThe answer is neither.\n\n# **FREQUENT BUGABOO #4 - NONE OF THE ABOVE**\n\n# **SOLUTION - NONE OF THE ABOVE**\n\n**You are looking for \"None of the above.\" \"None of the above\" is either the correct answer or it is a false answer, which we consider to be an incorrect answer.**\n\nOne way to think about it is that the only way to eliminate one sentence is to be sure that it really does make sense. If the answer choices are completely unrelated to the original sentence, then your initial choice is incorrect.\n\nIn the case of NONE OF THE ABOVE, if one of the answer choices makes sense in the context of the sentence, then you should eliminate it. If more than one of the answer choices seems to work with the sentence, that means the answer is NONE OF THE ABOVE and all of the suggestions are false.\n\n**Example:**\n\n> _a. \"The new law prohibits the firing of any employee.\" ( _ **_YES_**_ )\n> \n> _b. \"You are not allowed to stop someone from leaving your establishment.\" ( _ **_NO_**_ )\n> \n> _c. \"You should be wary when you meet this person.\" ( _ **_NO_** _)\n> \n> _d. \"You are no longer permitted to have this book on your desk.\" ( _ **_NO_**_ )\n\nFrom this example, c, d and a are all false but b is true. So the answer is \"None of the above.\"\n\n# **TIP #1**\n\nYou actually want to use this problem not just to _know more_ about transfer, but to _learn_ transfer. Transfer may be in a different subject, but the skill with which you solve this problem should be universal. There is a difference in how the question is presented and the way that you think about it, but it's the same concept.\n\nThink of a way to solve this problem without transfer at all. You know what they're thinking about, you know what they're implying, but they don't say it in so many words. You can infer that it's a transfer. They could have just said it. In our English exams, they use language to _teach_ the language. They explain things in such a way that the new language is not too challenging to understand. When you're solving questions without transfer at all, you're supposed to see what they've written as if they wrote it exactly that way.\n\nThere's nothing to infer. It's right there on the page"

        "output": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings?\nWhat is the most powerful fiber optic cable?\nWhen is it too late to buy fiber optic cable?\nA fiber-optic cable is a cable composed of light-carrying fibers that is used in optical telecommunications systems.\nWho invented the fiber cable?\nAlfred Kroehhoff is credited for the invention of fiber optic cable. He was looking for a way to move signals quickly and decided on light.\nWhy fiber optics is better than copper?\nFiber-optic cables are a more efficient means of transmission, meaning the signals and data move over the fiber-optic cable much quicker than traditional copper cable. Another reason fiber optics is better than copper is because they can carry more data over a single cable.\nWhat does fiber transmission make better?\nfiber optics is better than traditional copper due to the fact that it allows for data to travel over very long distances. This, obviously, is very helpful in transmission since in the age of technology there are tons of cables for multiple wires to be strung along, and a fiber-optic cable can span thousands of kilometers.\nWhy fiber is important to Internet?\nAs a result of this bandwidth increase, video is playing a larger role in Internet-based communications because the increase in data rate has been able to keep pace with the expansion in video formats and data transfer requirements. Fiber-optic cable plays an important role in broadband Internet applications.\nHow often should you change optical cables in buildings?\nWhen installing optical cables, ensure the cable connections are connected correctly and that the system is tested before commencing operation. Change optical cables as required, when spliced. An interval of about 2/3 year for long span optical cable.\nHow does optical fiber cable transmission work?\nOptically Amplified Optical Fiber Cable Transmission. At present, since the transmission distance of fiber-optic telephone lines is relatively short, it relies on an optical amplifier to improve the transmission speed and quality of data. Optical fiber has a number of unique properties."

Small farming systems are an important source of employment, as well as rural income and food that sustain a significant portion of Africa’s population.\n2.2.5 Smallholder crops production in Africa has tended to increase during the past decade. However, it is important to note that this has not been the case for all the commodity groups examined.\n2.2.6 The decline in global cereal prices and the resulting fall in international demand will affect the profitability of small farmers.\n2.2.7 The increase in food prices which has affected Africa since 2007 is a major challenge to food security in Africa.

        "output": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?), and how the new book is built (it has several components, only one of which is about what to do).\nThis entry was posted in Interviews, News and tagged climate change, climate policy, fossil fuels, global warming, james hansen, climate emergency, extinction, mass extinction, oil industry, coal industry, global warming, fossil fuel, carbon, fracking, global warming, ocean acidification on December 9, 2019 by Jim Langcuster.\nThis has been a year like no other one in U.S.-Russian history.\nIt all started with a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump in Helsinki on 16 July 2018. Some analysts were initially dubious about the meeting’s likely outcome. However, in a stunning development, Trump decided to side with Putin and challenge U.S. intelligence agencies, which have identified Russia as the principal culprit in the hacking of Democratic Party emails in 2016.\nThe Putin-Trump meeting in Helsinki had a decidedly chilling effect on U.S.-Russian relations, especially among Republicans.\nMany Republicans were still reeling from Trump’s decision in June 2018 to abandon the “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.” The agreement was crafted to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities, and its eventual withdrawal was viewed by many, including me, as a betrayal of U.S. and Israeli interests.\nPutin’s own standing in Washington had already deteriorated during the previous year as his regime became known for staging a political assasssion of the exiled former KGB officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the United Kingdom.\nIn sum, the Helsinki meeting was not the high point of Trump’s presidency, not by far. It only managed to consolidate the deep distrust that many in both parties had already been harboring toward a president and a chief international opponent who had not always shown the greatest degree of care for U.S. national interests.\nAnd the year did not begin with such a Trump-Putin meeting in Helsinki. Instead, it began with a series of high-level meetings and visits between U.S. and Russian officials, along with continued negotiations on a “New START” treaty between the two countries, which would set limits on nuclear weapons.\nThen, in early January, the Kremlin staged an election in which a Putin loyalist was returned to serve as president for at least another six years. And in February, the Kremlin began to openly display a number of provocative acts – most notably the shooting down of a pro-Western opposition politician, an opposition politician. In many ways, there was an undeniable pattern in these actions: the more a Kremlin appears to be backing Trump, the more openly it engages – some would say provokes – U.S. adversaries.\nAnd, of course, Putin never has seemed more like an adversary of the United States in our own political history since during the Cold War.\nTrump was, of course, acquitted in his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate. And many Americans were elated over the fact that he would survive his own party’s attempt to overturn his presidency.\nHowever, that was only the beginning of this year’s U.S. political drama.\nIn May, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to block Russia’s invasion into Syria’s Idlib province. It was the second time in a short span of time that Russia’s invasion of Syria had been stopped by American naval forces patrolling the Eastern Mediterranean.\nHowever, the Senate’s passage also signaled that – at least in the Senate – U.S. lawmakers seemed to be more concerned about Syrian military matters than with domestic Trump affairs at the moment.\nAlthough impeachment was at the forefront of America’s political debates in early 2019, it faded rapidly from view. And as it faded from view, another political subplot started to emerge – the issue of U.S.-Chinese tensions and the growing American trade deficit with China. Some analysts have called the situation America’s looming, silent foreign policy crisis.\nSome analysts say that China was always America’s biggest foreign policy threat – and that this issue may be growing into a full-scale foreign policy crisis in the United States.\nI’m reminded of the saying that if you keep putting a Band-Aid on a bad wound, a patient can live for longer without pain, but he will die sooner than one that has more treatment.\nThe Trump administration continues to wage an “economic war” against China. However, many analysts are quick to add that U.S. economic aggression toward China is causing the problems more than anything it’s doing about them – and that America’s aggressive stance toward China is not only making us poorer, but it’s hurting America’s allies in Europe"

        "output": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?\nThe relationship of visible light from an object and the wavelength is dependent on its temperature. The relationship is such that higher temperature means the wavelength is more blue and lower intensity, low temperature means lower intensity and less blue wavelengths.\nHow does a black body curve correspond to specific wavelengths of light?\nThe idea is that the Planck law gives all the required info. This law is very much like the Wien law. The main difference is: Wien's law is only valid for one wavelength, i.e. it talks about the temperature at which the central peak is observed. Planck law gives us all the required info for all wavelengths. But we cannot directly use the peak to peak wavelength in Wien's law, because its center is unstable and the peak-to-peak is just half of the peak-to-peak in Planck's law.\nHow can the wavelength be inversely proportional to the temperature and proportional to the radius in the photoelectric effect?\nIt has 16.41 wavelength, approximately.\nWhat is the best formula to answer this question? How high is the speed of light and how low does it go??\nThe frequency of a photon is related to the energy of the photon by E = mc2 and for a blackbody emitter it can be expressed by the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nWhy does my camera's zoom lens not allow me to go from 12mm-63mm?\nDoes the frequency spectrum of blue light increase as its wave length increase with temperature?\nThe wavelength of light gets smaller as the temperature increases. The frequency varies as well, so it is not proportional to the distance between peaks. However, it follows the inverse relationship of the Planck relation: 1/ν/ε = c.\nHow does a photoelectric cell work?\nThe energy is not proportional to wavelength, it is the frequency of the photon that determines its energy.\nHow does a black body curve correspond to specific wavelengths of light? 1. 2. 3. 4.\nWhat do you mean by temperature proportional to the square of wavelength?\nit means that wavelength will increase if you increase the temperature.\nWhat is the frequency of light for the electromagnetic spectrum?\nThe frequency is proportional to the wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency.\nWhere can I find the equation of how energy is dependent on the temperature of an object?\nPlanck's law deals with the energy of the photon and its frequency. The higher the temperature the higher the energy, the longer the wavelength.\nWhat is the formula that determines the brightness of a black-body thermal source emitting photons with frequency at a given temperature?\nThe specific radiation intensity of a black-body thermal source is given by Planck's formula: I ∝ h ν 4 p, where I is the intensity emitted per unit area at a given frequency n = c/ν and for a color temperature T c, p = 6.63 x 10-34 watts.\nWhat is the minimum wavelength required to interact with the surface of a black body?\nIt would depend on the temperature of the black body.\nWhat color of light and how much is proportional to temperature?\nWhat is the formula for calculating the intensity of light at a given wavelength?\nAs it's proportional to the square of wavelength, it's the same formula as light. Light is given by the equation: I = 2πhc/λ .\nWavelength of visible light as a function of temperature of an object?\nI know that red light is longer than blue, but there is a very interesting aspect to this question..... The wavelength of a light decreases as the temperature of an object increases, as seen from this image (click for a large version): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_electric_effect You'll note that the peak of red falls between the peaks of infrared waves (in this graph the wavelength is given as number of \"Bohr radii\").\nBlackbody temperature from the peak frequency of electromagnetic radiation?\nThe temperature can be found by multiplying the frequency of the peak of the black body radiation by Planck's constant, then dividing by the speed of light.\nHow many light waves are in the blue spectrum and how many in the red spectrum?\nThe frequencies of all the frequencies of the EM spectrum are inversely proportional to the wavelengths of said frequencies.\nWhat is the wavelength of the visible spectrum of light?\nThe wavelengths for the visible spectrum of light range from about 380 to 760 nanometers (38000 A, A being the abbreviation for Angstrom"

(it could not be that hard for you).\"\nOf course not, the evidence is overwhelming. All I need do is cite the latest polls from the Russian Federation of Public opinion (a pro-Putin NGO).\nRussia has 7 main television channels, 50-60 newspaper publishers with print runs of 1 million plus. The press and the television networks are under direct Putin's control. A small but important point is that the internet is 100% state controlled.\nSo just to be \"fair\" you could argue that all these channels, publications and websites could be lying. So how you could convince the world that Russian television has an audience larger than 4-5 million with 5 billion being possible (how could you get that number?) is a bit tricky and not very likely. The same applies to the newspapers. Even the best Western newspapers are undercut by the Russian networks.\nIn fact, the best way to prove the opposite would be with facts from Russia's economy and history and not from the mouths of the Kremlin's mouthpiece. That's a bit more difficult, but you could try, e.g. use the fact that Putin was never even once attacked by anybody for being \"not democratic\". Of course, this applies to the very same people that in the West are called \"liberals\" and that are \"democracy\" experts.\nSo my question to you is:\n\"If Putin is so bad, why don't some Western democracy experts criticize him for not being a \"democrat\"? How could that be possible? This is not a trick question, I am trying to make you answer why it is that you need to pretend that you are from the other side? Why do you have to pretend that you are representing those who criticizes Putin?\"\n\"This is not a trick question, I am trying to make you answer why it is that you need to pretend that you are from the other side? Why do you have to pretend that you are representing those who criticizes Putin?\"\nI am not from the other side. I have no idea what you are talking about.\nThis site is full of Russian trolls-I have found.\nI've been getting this same response for 5 years now.\n\"I have no idea what you are talking about.\nI've been getting this same response for 5 years now.\"\n\"I've been getting this same response for 5 years now.\"\nWhat's this supposed to prove? Your previous responses have shown that you have no arguments and no facts, you try to bully using the numbers, but not even your own country's numbers.\nYou seem to confuse the Russian Federation of Public Opinion being a \"pro-Putin NGO\" with the RFPO, doing all the polling you claim, being a \"Kremlin mouthpiece\" and \"Putin's propaganda apparatus\", as you stated above.\nIn fact, I suspect you don't know the meaning of \"non-governmental organization\", whatever your nationality is.\nIf one day Putin says he is not happy with the polls you use, why would you accept them? And what would happen to Putin's popularity in Russia then?\nI'll do some work on the FSB. I'll find out.\n\"I'll do some work on the FSB. I'll find out.\"\nIt is a bit of a strange response. You think the Russians would have some answers for that?\nWell, no. They have even some difficulties in explaining why their president needs no approval from anybody when he makes a decision and how he can even ask the State Duma for approval for a matter that is clearly an executive matter.\nAnd yes, if they let the FSB come up with something it would be a real laugh.\nOf course, if you know something better, I'd be happy to discuss.\nI'll try to convince you that people outside Russia are very well aware in what an authoritarian dictator Putin is and how much he manipulates the people and tries to force them into his ideology."

        "instruction": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I’m a five year old",
        "output": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I’m a five year old, I’ll let you go.\nIn my book, if you don’t understand and you’re a person who’s supposedly educated as a member of the medical profession, you should be ashamed or you have to explain to people what sarcoidosis is on a very basic level.\nIt’s a systemic autoimmune disease that involves inflammation of specific organs. It affects the eyes, skin, and, most commonly, the lungs.\nFor example, I want to take a look at the skin, which is a very visible organ to everyone around an individual suffering. Skin lesions commonly seen, usually multiple. You may see lesions called “nodules,” which are small and round. These are the most common, but they are not the only lesions. Large, red or purple “lumps” called “sclerotic nodules” may also show up. Smaller, grey “rash or bruise-like” lesions called “luguloforms” are also sometimes seen.\nThe skin lesions are often seen on the top of the fingers, fingers, and palms, the shins, and the buttocks.\nThe typical cause of this is the presence of inflammation anywhere and then the release of white blood cells, which are part of an individual’s defense against infection. When these inflammatory cells can’t be expelled and released from the tissue, they end up clustering together and forming these lesions.\nHow do these lesions form, and why? Well, I think that this is a really complex situation and it has an enormous scientific community to explain the cause of this. No one knows exactly what causes sarcoidosis, but the most common theory is that one person is in contact with something. Perhaps, they were bitten by a mosquito that has a fungus on it.\nMaybe maybe the patient had a respiratory infection, a skin infection, or some kind of trauma to the skin. Then that infection, if you will, or trauma causes an immune response because our immune system was trying to fight that infection or trauma off. And then those white blood cells and inflammatory cells continue to get into the system, they continue to create lesions, they continue to release proteins, and they just cause all this inflammation.\nNow, this disease is progressive in that once it’s in your body, these cells will continue to build on themselves, they will continue to build on top of themselves because we have a really bad design in our immune system here.\nIn particular, if we have certain genetic variants, we will make a disease worse. So we have a gene called T.TAP that really encourages those white blood cells to get in there and to start that cycle. There are other genes that may change how the disease plays out as well.\nBut you really need that genetic background and then the exposure to something to actually get the syndrome, which means that it’s very unlikely to be the case by having a single event exposure. But it’s also really unlikely that someone will never have exposure to something that causes them to have sarcoidosis, or that they will continue to have multiple exposures to things that continue to aggravate the condition.\nSo what’s the treatment for sarcoidosis and will it be eradicated from my DNA? What are the long term complications I risk?\nWe’re getting ready to talk about the long term complications and then we can get on to what we’re doing to help. So, from the very beginning, the main treatment of sarcoidosis is basically to take things away from you.\nYou have to get a medication that’s called corticosteroids and those are some of the most powerful things you can inject into your body. These are things such as prednisone, prednisolone, or maybe methylprednisolone and these are steroids. You can get them orally or you can get them through an injection. They really help with the inflammation. They’ll help reduce the lesions, but also with what’s called fibrosis. They’re causing scarring, they’re creating scars on the organs. So if I get on prednisone, my lungs are going have less inflammation, but I also might lose lung function. My eyes might lose sight, depending on how well it was administered, and my skin, well, your skin’s gonna get really fat, I mean, seriously and really thin. I might put on 20 pounds of body fat, which was pretty bad because I’m not the fittest man.\nAnother big thing is that it can really affect your kidneys, so if you put on 20 pounds of fat on your body, you’re also going to be very inflamed with your kidneys and that inflammation will kill them. So you have to stay off of prednisone as much as you can. You have to take these medicines"

I am fighting Yugoloths in Gehenna. I roll to attack them with my +1 Rapier. Does a 24 hit?\n\n\nA: The following rules apply both to a +1 and a -1 weapon in this situation:\n\n...[I]f the +1 or -1 bonus does not reduce the total damage of the melee weapon to fewer than 5 or 6, respectively, the penalty for nonhumans or nonmonstrous creatures applies.\n\n5e uses four different levels for creature levels. 1-3 are levels of \"Humans\"; 4+ are levels of \"Nonhumans\". \nDrow are, both by description and by table, nonhuman. That means they receive a -2 damage bonus while using a +1 melee weapon, just like other nonhumans. \nI haven't personally tested this, but the following should work fine. A +1 weapon deal 2 wounds of damage normally. A Drow with an attack roll of 22, thusly, would get +2 from the +1 and 2 from the Drow race 6 + 8 - 2 = 14 +3 for the rogue and 21 = wound + str. \nIn your situation of a melee weapon that is not +1/-1, this penalty would continue to apply while the effects of the +1 (assuming it wasn't a +2 or +3) were cumulative - i.e. the +1 would be offset by the 2 from the -2. Thus you'd be at roughly 19 before the -2 penalty is applied.\nNote that no -2 penalty applies to non-human characters when using weapons of +0 or greater.\n\nA: The drow are human and don't get the -2 to hit penalty.\n\nDrow can't use bonus weapons but this should not apply to your scenario as they are humans.\n\nHuman drow are human but are given the negative hit penalties against monsters of the monster's race.

Take note of where you would invest your limited time over the next year. (See Appendix G for a suggested time and investment plan.)\n2. Develop and create a comprehensive Shabbat program for your community. If you cannot start with a full weekly program but rather a monthly one, start there. For example, every month on a Friday Shabbat evening one or two community members will lead the service and will prepare the participants to observe the Shabbat with a short class on learning more about the Shabbat. The participants will then break a special Shabbat meal. The next Sunday a guest speaker from the Temple or from the community will give Shabbat insights and how to observe Shabbat through a lecture. After the Shabbat services, there will be a potluck. Finally, on a weekly basis one or two volunteers will bring a special Shabbat service and Shabbat program at the Synagogue for the community.\nB. Establish a Shabbat-dedicated program.\nYour community needs a Shabbat-dedicated program in your Synagogue. A Shabbat program is an opportunity for new members to join a Jewish congregation that celebrates the unique Jewish festival and the Jewish tradition. By celebrating the Shabbat, we as Jewish gather one to celebrate our unity and our history. We are one of the few religions of the world that still observe this tradition today.\nTo begin with start with one or two Jewish young professional, with assistance from the Rabbi, to plan and create a comprehensive Shabbat program (see Appendix). This program should last for a minimum of two months. Your program could be a monthly Shabbat event at the Synagogue and also a weekly Shabbat program at the Synagogue. The monthly portion should have a class on the history and meaning of the Shabbat which will be followed by Shabbat service and end with a special Shabbat dinner and a lesson given by a guest speaker or a person from the Temple or from the broader local Jewish community. The weekly portion could be a class on the theme, service or another Jewish tradition such as Chanukah or Passover. All the events should have in mind that they are for new members and those who would like to learn more about being Jewish and Shabbat.\nThe weekly event should have as its core three components: a welcoming of the community at the Synagogue, a Shabbat-dedicated service and an educational session (both for young and old) on Jewish festival and Jewish tradition. This core can be supplemented with special Shabbat meals, a special Shabbat lecture or a visit by a guest speaker on the Shabbat or on the topic of that Shabbat. Finally, the community can invite a small group of new members to join them for a special meal on the Shabbat before Rosh Hashana or a day of reflection on Shabbat. Finally, the host should prepare and the community should prepare a Shabbat-dedicated service for their guests, on special occasions and during the year.\nA. Prepare and offer a special meal on Rosh Hashana, Tu Bishvat, Yom Kippur, Chanukah, Hanukah, Purim, Passover and Shavuot. It would be very important and meaningful to your community to offer special meals on Jewish festivals to those who are not members and are interested in a particular festival or any other activity that you can offer.\nB. Have a speaker on Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Hanukah, Purim, Passover and/or Shavuot. It is very important that you can have a speaker on special Shabbat-dedicated activities throughout the year. The special speakers can speak about the Jewish festival or about a Jewish theme. The special speakers can come from the community, from the Temple or from outside the community. In this way, we are developing and bringing more people into our Temple and Jewish community and increasing our overall membership.\nC. In a Shabbat-dedicated program, the Temple can serve as a home for various organizations, groups and committees.\nThe Temple could serve as a home for a community event, a day school, social work and other social services offered by other community organizations.\nThere are also the Jewish Family Services (JFS), Hesed Communities and Jewish Family Services are all organizations that assist people (usually older people), that have their roots in Jewish community, but most of them have no connection with a religious or synagogues.\nThe Temple could also serve as a home for a day school. The Temple could serve as a place for a day school during the week and as a place for a religious school on Saturdays.\n"

Then you only need to look at the number of ways to choose one dot to place in a row/column. For example, if you choose a row, you can choose from either of the two, say you choose from $R$. What is the number of ways to place a dot in $R$? There are two choices: at the top or bottom. Similarly, the number of ways to place a dot in a column is equal to $2$, except for the middle dot, which can be placed in the top, middle (which is a special case), and bottom slots. Thus if a line is occupied, there are $3$ ways to place a dot on it. However, if the line has been previously occupied, then we can make an addition - since we are occupying the previous line, we must place our dot in the unique way, which is above the chosen dot in our previous line (i.e. the top dot of the previous line). Thus, adding these contributions, the total number of ways to place a dot if the line $R$ is occupied is equal to $3 + 1 = 4$. There are two such lines. So, in total there are $8$ possible ways to place a dot onto this table. Here is a picture to demonstrate:\n\nNow, consider a table with 2 occupied rows (both can be considered as a single set of rows). We now distinguish the two sets of dots on the top row as we would with two separate rows. In this case, there are $5$ ways to place a dot on this line if the line has been occupied, and $6$ different ways if it hasn't. Then the total number is $5 + 6 = 11$.\nThus, the total number of ways to place a dot onto a set $A$ is equal to $$\\sum_{|A|=1} 4 + \\sum_{|A|=2} 11.$$\nNow, there are $4$ different ways to choose $A$ - 2 ways, 3 ways, or all of them - thus the total number of ways to put dots onto this table (while respecting the rule that each column must have a dot in it) is \n$$4 \\times"

I would change a few things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*The title: I would probably write: \"Who should look for it?\" This way you put yourself in his shoes, imagining how his mind works.\n\n*The first sentence of the paragraph: Instead of writing it in third person and having it read \"{NSW Residential Building Contract for Small Works over $20,000}\" I would write \"How would this person look at this information?\" and write his name. In this way you focus on him, not his task.\n\n*The last two sentences: I would write this information as an advice for people who are not familiar with the language. For this reason you should make it \"concise, plain-language\", with an advice for not using a quotation and a value limit. Do you know that \"in place of\" is a very formal language and not to describe a person who is not familiar with technology. \"Instead of\", \"in stead of\",\"rather than\" are better words. To put more perspective I could add a sentence such like \"... and may not know how to use it properly. \""

        "output": "Write me the first act of a play in Shakespearian style about a porcupine named Prickles who wants to be a seamstress.\" Well... you see, I did it. It's a little long, but it's not a bad little tale, I think. I called it Porcupine Princess (I was never a fan of the word \"Prickles\").\n\n\"When I saw Aurelie again,\" I said, \"I went to see my old friend in the hospital. She was on the mend when I returned to France. One of the surgeons had thought she was quite dead, so they were quite surprised she had lived through the operation.\n\n\" 'So I saw you again,' said Aurelie, with a great deal of pleasure and a certain amount of anger. 'You will never forget me, you see! I don't want to see you again at all. You have no idea what you have done to _Creuse_!'\n\n\" 'Aurelie,' I said, 'will you not listen to me?'\n\n\" 'No, no, I will not even talk to you,' she said. 'You have not thought of a single thing that I could want. _Creuse_ wants to leave France, she wants to get out of the _Quartier_ , she wants to be free. But _you_ did not think! There is only one thing she could want, and you have not thought of it.'\n\n\"I was astonished, and angry, and I didn't care to listen to _Aurelie_. 'What is it?' I said, out of patience, but I wasn't cruel to her. 'Well? She wants an apartment of her own, like the other girls. You have never thought, ever, of anything that the other girls might want. Your father said you'd been a great help, so he was happy for you to come back with me. But you haven't been any help at all.'\n\n\" 'Oh, no!' she said. 'Of course not. You never did anything because you never thought of it. You don't ever ask _Creuse_ what she wants. I'm going to tell you what I want, and never you mind what _Creuse_ wants.'\n\n\" 'I'm sorry things haven't gone so well,' I said kindly. 'There was that boy. Still, he does like you. You can see that from the way he looks at you.'\n\n\" 'Pah! He looks at _Creuse_. You don't know anything about it. He always did like _Creuse_. And you didn't even write and say, \"I'm sorry things have gone so badly,\" like a _vrai_ son! Just \"I'm sorry things haven't gone so well, _you_ know, they always do in the first letter,\" just as if it hadn't been _your_ fault there was _no_ first letter to make things go well. That's how _Creuse_ always tells it!'\n\n\"I tried hard to tell her, in a nice way, that I had written two letters to _Creuse_ before my father went away to fight, and had received two letters from _Creuse_. She only scoffed. 'Creuse did not write, and you sent two letters that only talked about _Creuse_.'\n\n\"I asked her about the boy. I wanted to help Aurelie, I wanted to make things right for her. 'You don't get on very well with him,' I said. 'It's not him you like, it's the thought of having a relationship with him. He is only part of it. So I want to help you by making you like him.'\n\n\"But Aurelie did not want to help herself. She sat there like a peacock in the middle of a pond and said, 'No thanks, not for me, no. He's a bad boy, and I don't want a bad boy.' But I did not want her to have a bad boy, I said, not the first one we met. It didn't matter so much what kind of a boy we went out with, as long as the first one was a good one.\n\n\" 'And don't you see, Aurelie,' I said, 'that it can't be that he's not a good one. He does look at _Creuse_ all the time, he does his best to get us all to be friends, and he always comes back to see us.' That was before he gave up on the idea"

It encompasses the knowledge and insight of a particular discipline which makes it relevant to a particular field of study. In theory, a concept can be applied to multiple areas. In a similar manner, a foundation for research can be used by multiple researchers, across disciplines.\nThere are several theories in health psychology that focus on the social and environmental factors that are the potential causes of stress and illness and that increase the occurrence of disease and health issues. For example, the study of health has a focus on the study and assessment of the psychological well-being, or psychological state of an individual or an entire population.\nTheory of Stress and Coping\nThe theory of stress and coping is one of the major theories that is used in health psychology. The theory indicates that stress and stress management are linked, that is, the occurrence of a stress will lead to a certain response from an individual or a population, and such a response may produce an effect on health. This theory is based on the fact that stress can be caused by either a stimulus or a situation, which leads to a reaction.\nThe stimulus includes internal biological factors and also external environmental factors. For example, physical factors include physical illness, social factors, interpersonal factors, environmental factors, etc., while the reaction of a person to the stressors or stress factors are often measured by the use of anxiety, or physiological responses, or other variables. However, depending on the individual, reaction could also be positive or beneficial, whereas in other situations, it could also be negative or harmful. Therefore, the effect of stressor/stress factor depends on the individuals’ psychological and physiological response.\nThe other theory in the studies of health and risk factors is the health belief model, or the HBM. This model takes into consideration the psychological aspects of the individual’s state of health. The model assumes that individuals are conscious of their illnesses, and are aware of potential causes for such illnesses but the belief of the individual in the effect of factors on individuals health determines the psychological well-being of an individual. That is, individuals can suffer from various illnesses or diseases and in this instance, those who view themselves as prone to be affected by such illnesses are likely to believe in the occurrence of the disease. This is because of the individual’s perceived vulnerability to an illness.\nTheories of Health Psychology\nThe theories of health psychology mainly focus on the study of the role of factors which affect the health of populations. The concept of health is broad in nature, and the health of a person or group of people comprises a broad range of factors such as physical health, psychological well being, and social factors that affect individual health, as well as the health of social groups. Theories in health psychology focus on the study of the stress and coping responses of individuals to such factors that affect health.\nHealth Psychology and Social Factors\nThe theories in health psychology, which have been defined above, look to the study of the psychological, social, and environmental factors that may affect health and, therefore, affect an individual’s health."

The project involves the development of an online platform to manage the project and provide a community and social networking for the project around the world.\nThe challenge is to create a project of 50 stories under 100 words with the use of the story telling medium, Facebook, Twitter and text-messaging. While the stories are under 400 characters, they can use any story and creative medium to tell their fiction. For example, an essay, blog post, prose, poetry, a video of only the stories or pictures of just the story. The stories or the creative medium can be original or something that has been shared and re-used online before.\nThe 50 stories is to be told in ten days or so, but it could extend up to 50 days if needed or as long as a story is available on the social internet to be utilized. The goal is to have stories to take on life with the potential for making more stories from one.\nEach story can be created by anyone in the world at any time and with any medium. Once submitted, it will be part of the global community and a new story will be posted each week or so according to the community's social schedule. Stories can be re-shared as desired.\nStories must originate from the idea of the community with only the 50 stories total for which there will be a book available online to the public. The global community of story tellers can reach out to their friends and colleagues to add more stories to the collection.\nIn the long run, participants will gain more experience in social media like Facebook, Twitter and text messaging and the Internet as a venue to tell fiction stories. The goal for the first project was to see 300 participants in the community, but this number can be raised in the future.\nThe short stories can have any creative form, but the 400 character limit should ensure the story has the ability to be told as a whole and not just a short piece of text. For example, an essay of 400 words or more would probably be too much story for one posting.\nIf short stories are more like blogs as 400 words or so, then two stories that share the format can be created as one story like a book. For examples, think of two or more tweets in a single post as a text message with both the beginning and ending of a story. An online post can show the story or pictures for one short story, and a video can show several short stories.\nIf short poems are more like blogs, then short stories that share the form can be created as one story like a book. For examples, think of two or more tweets in a single post as a text message with both the beginning and ending of a story. An online post can show the story or pictures for one short story, and a video can show several short stories.\nThe story telling community wants you to get stories in to the action and begin telling your stories.

        "output": "I have competencies in remote sensing, machine learning, and water resource knowledge, what are the possible jobs I can occupy? What are the possible projects I can do? What companies I can work at?” But before asking these questions, we will begin our session with a look at current status of flood forecasting methods, followed by how various communities may address the problem.\nThe purpose of the session is to have participants discuss and exchange ideas on their potentials and limitations, and explore how different communities, or regions, can interact and cooperate on common issues, such as flood forecasting accuracy, efficiency, and cost effectiveness.\nOne of the problems in the Flood Forecast Modeling community is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient amount of data or observations. This session focuses on how participants can collect data and observations through various approaches, while observing limitations and advantages.\nAs noted above, flood forecasts are typically made using models that simulate future weather, and the models that are used by FEMA and USAID are not always accurate enough. An alternative to building one’s own model is the use of models that other people have made and tested. However the model should be tested by the user before deployment. A model should be evaluated on four criteria: accuracy, efficiency, and cost effectiveness, and impact.\nWe will introduce participants to various models they can use, provide guidance on how to operate and test the model, present various data sources from different countries, and how data providers are involved in the system.\nWe will use the flood forecasting example to illustrate how to operate a model and test it. The model is an interactive model that a user can operate on a web-based platform. If this is the first time to do a flood forecast, then a detailed user’s guide will be provided (1) to provide necessary information, and (2) to show how to enter inputs, run the model, view results, and so on, while the users will be assisted by knowledgeable modelers who have experienced using the same platform. After the first use of the model, the users will be asked to follow up with them to provide further feedback.\nThis session provides an opportunity for participants to share their own data and observations, and exchange ideas with their communities on various aspects of flood forecasting. Participants will be provided a web-based platform to enter and upload their observations, data, and their understanding of the modeling system, including links to their own websites that have additional details.\nThese are the same data and observations that were provided to potential modelers in the previous session.\nParticipants will have 5 minutes to make a presentation about their observations from the previous session, including discussions with data providers and modelers. These discussions will result on recommendations to improve the data and the model.\nWe will summarize the discussion during the previous sessions, and discuss how best modelers, data providers, and data collectors can work together to address common issues, and to create sustainable open partnerships.\nAs part of the pre-conference session we will hold a one-hour workshop for USAID.\nThe 8-page document contains summaries of 33 research publications on modeling approaches based on remote sensing and spaceborne L-band SAR/InSAR data.\nThis 7-page document has an in-depth summary of spaceborne SAR.\nWith this web-based platform, we present a tutorial of LSM and demonstrate various applications."

        "output": "Write a funny, interesting, inspiring poem for Women's Day.\n\n* Write a story or a drama and submit it to the school literary magazine. A poem is almost always short and simple, so that it can hold interest all the way to the end. Don't write a lot of lines on the subject of a girl! The girl in the story could be like you and her home and her clothes might be a bit similar to yours, and her problems might have a basis in real life, but you want to set your novel far away from the fact-book version of reality. A real girl's problems are private.\n\n**A girl does not have problems. She is always in trouble.**\n\n**  \n**\n\n### FACEBOOK FACTS\n\n_The first person to use the word \"facebook,\" meaning \"a social structure that allows people to share personal information and view the social network in which they and their friends interact,\" was Mark Zuckerberg, who uses it on Facebook itself._\n\n### HACKING AND PHISHING\n\nYou don't want your identity or anything critical to your computer being hacked. This includes sensitive information, which a hacker might be able to use if he or she were invited into your email, your computer system, or your Facebook account. Here are some of the problems with hacking:\n\nFacebook accounts are hacked all the time. This makes them a target.\n\n  \n\n**Hackers have gotten into people's email, and they have stolen money and credit card numbers from those accounts.**\n\n  \n\n**Hackers can access your email, including your Facebook messages, and forward them to someone else, using the recipient's email**\n\nHackers are very sneaky \n\nHackers, on the other hand, are often not very smart, but just very eager, and that is a big plus. But even if they are not skilled, just because they are clever enough to trick you does not mean they are trustworthy and that you can use them as a friend.\n\nSome online scams are called \"phishing\" (think: \"fishing\" in the water). Scammers will lure you into giving up personal information via emails that they tell you appear to have come from a bank or other legitimate corporation, but really came from the scammer. For example, they ask you to open an electronic message or attachment by email, and if their \"e-mail\" seems like it is from the bank that is handling your account, you will click that link or button and give them the information instead of your legitimate banking institution. This is called phishing.\n\nHere's another one: When you receive a message from your Facebook account saying that you won some kind of reward or have gotten an unrequited message from someone and that you need to log into Facebook to claim it, you can assume that it was sent by a hacker. This is called social engineering.\n\n### DON'T PANIC\n\nWhen you receive a message on Facebook that seems threatening, don't panic.\n\n**Look for an account, not a person**\n\n**  \n**\n\n**Remember that you can use the Facebook Help Center any time and learn about:\n\nFacebook's policies**\n\n**How to keep your information safe**\n\n**What to do if you encounter problems**\n\n**How to report a problem that was caused to you by a hacker**\n\n**How to find out whether hackers have accessed your Facebook account**\n\n**How to get your Facebook account back**\n\n**  \n**\n\n**  \n**\n\n**Here's what to do:**\n\n1. Do not open an email message that you are not expecting.\n\n2. Do not open a link within an email message that you are not expecting.\n\n3. Never respond to an email message from someone you have not heard from before.\n\n4. Take a look at the email address in question  see if it is the same as you would expect for a legitimate corporation, or for your bank. If it is not, delete the message.\n\n5. Don't click any links in that message that say, \"This message is from a computer system or an unknown user. Please click here to sign in and then respond.\"\n\n6. If you receive an email or a message from Facebook that asks for \"your username,\" be suspicious. This is a social engineering request. Do not respond.\n\n### THERE'S A PLACE FOR EVERYBODY\n\nYou've seen the Facebook profiles of other people. There are a lot, and now you can have your own. But first you probably want to check out what other people have done on Facebook. Then you can decide what kind of a deal or special offer you might create for somebody.\n\nThere's a saying that \""

Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n\nA: For a given thickness, the energy efficiency of a window is primarily determined by the percentage of light transmittance. For double glazed windows the ratio varies from 0.5 to 0.6 while for triple glazed windows it varies from 0.3 to 0.5. So the efficiency does not necessarily improve with a higher number of panes, but it can only be expected to increase.\nThis is also shown by a calculation:\n$\nE =\\frac{n l c}{k_b T}\n$\nwhere \nfor single glazed windows\n$\n\\frac{n l c}{k_b T} = \\frac{0.5 c}{k_b T} = 0.5 \\frac{k_b}{c} T\n$\nfor double glazed windows\n$\n\\frac{n l c}{k_b T} = \\frac{0.6 c}{k_b T} = 0.6 \\frac{k_b}{c} T\n$\nand for triple glazed windows\n$\n\\frac{n l c}{k_b T} = \\frac{0.6 c}{k_b T} = 0.6 \\frac{k_b}{c} T\n$\nand the coefficient varies from approximately 1.6 to 2.7.

But I do think it's important to be cautious of this model and the technology behind it, and that AI can never replace human beings.\nI would never have dreamed of writing something like this in the form of a tweet. That's because GPT3 is a sophisticated, sophisticated AI-based technology.\nGPT3 can write news reports, stories about business deals and even short stories, poems and plays. And although I wrote about it in my tweet, I am not against the use of GPT3. It is a technology that can help companies improve their websites, create applications, or even write blog posts for them.\nFor example, companies can use the GPT3 technology to create a website designed to generate content for their visitors based on what is popular on the Internet. That's what happened to me after I published this article. I wrote an article about the best AI-powered content generators and the article was read by over 4,000 people. This means that I had some influence on people's lives. What a responsibility!\nI am not an AI expert  neither am I a scientist or computer engineer - but I do feel something of the significance of this technology, which can be used to change the world, to help people or even to create new content for websites.\nHowever, the consequences of this technology will be greater than we could ever imagine. I think that GPT3 and other AI-based technologies will have a huge impact on businesses, as well as life in general, and that our brains and lives will be modified to a greater extent than we can imagine.\nFor example, I recently heard about a technology that uses AI-based technology to change our brains. I'm not going to talk about it here, because I wouldn't like to mislead you, so go and learn more about it. The next week, in my interview with the German company Siemens, I will talk a lot more about this.\nI am convinced that GPT3 is the first \"postmodern\" tool that will change the world by changing our minds. And at the moment, there are no rules that we can rely on.\nIf you have questions that relate to AI, whether it's how GPT3 works or how companies are using the technology, please ask them here. As I said, I'm not an AI expert, but I will try my best to answer them!\nZo  2023\nSupport  Terms  Privacy  Security"

        "instruction": "How would the Future of AI in 10 Years look?",
        "output": "How would the Future of AI in 10 Years look?\nAccording to Forbes, machine learning is already in the mainstream, and all the new smart devices such as voice-activated virtual assistants Alexa and Google Home, or smart appliances such as Nespresso, or connected devices for home security are a result of developing machine and deep learning algorithms. The future of AI is something that excites and terrifies at the same time, as AI researchers are trying to find ways to make AI more human.\nIn the year 2020, AI will start becoming more like us humans, and it will get even better in 2030, when AI will be as human as robots have been ever since the first models were built during the 50s. This will mean that machines are able to solve problems in a manner resembling humans, but it will also mean that humans will have more time to focus on more valuable tasks.\nThe more you use social media and the mobile devices, the easier it is for companies to gain information about your behavior, what you are doing and where you are while doing it. This makes companies understand the user better, and also creates opportunities for marketing services to provide better advertising to targeted populations, resulting in a better user experience.\nIn the foreseeable future, it will be possible to share an image on social media, and as a result of learning from that image, an AI can create a new image of a human in your face. AI is also getting capable of processing the data coming from big data projects, meaning it can process images, images, text, and audio files much faster than ever before, which will give companies and researchers more time to analyze those bigger datasets.\nAI will also affect how businesses work and how we operate our industries in the future. There is a lot of data coming in from sensors on machines, and if these machines work and do not have Internet, then AI will have to make decisions on behalf of humans, in order to make sure that the data is correctly analyzed, and the machines work correctly. Today, this often means that AI is trained to look for patterns in the data and analyze it, in order to predict what will happen next. However, not all data collected from sensors is created equal, often a pattern in a certain dataset can be predicted by looking at how the system works, by what people did in the past or what they are likely to do when they are in a state of a certain kind, or what is the most likely state.\nWhat will happen to the future of work?\nThe change in the way we work is one of the things that will happen to the future of work. In recent years, companies and people have been adapting to the technological changes that have impacted how we work and live. Jobs are being created, some are being replaced by technology, and others remain to keep up with people in their field.\nNew technologies like AI are one of the keys to finding new business models and business models that can work for the future of work. Many companies are implementing AI into their business because it can help them to save costs, improve their customer service, and increase their bottom line.\nThe AI revolution in today’s time has completely changed the work place. AI is a science-based approach that uses artificial intelligence as a way to solve problems in our daily lives. AI is an important part of our work because it helps us to find information that we might not have found when we were looking for someone to help us with jobs or other tasks.\nThe future of work is changing rapidly and the more changes we have to be aware of, the more we can use technology and AI to help us.\nHow AI will have a profound effect on the business world?\nBusinesses have always worked with different models and strategies that they think help achieve success. Businesses that follow a specific strategy tend to stay at the top when competition is very high. Different companies try to achieve the best business strategy based on their own ideas and capabilities.\nHowever, we need to take new approaches to keep the business world in line with the changing business environment. Today we have seen that most of the major companies’ strategies have failed to cope with the environment of their competitors. Some of the important parts that have changed, and will continue to change the business world in the future, are the changing demographics, new business models, new business partners, new customer expectations and the increasing competition in the market.\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence, it is important for businesses to know how AI works. AI technology helps companies understand how to solve problems in a much more efficient way, with less human hours, and more time to focus on the future strategy of their business.\nIn most business areas, AI has made it possible to implement automation, which means that you can cut down labor costs by eliminating manual and time-consuming tasks. AI takes a problem that you were solving manually with employees and then automates it. This leaves you more time to focus on new things and new"

So, this film doesnâ€™t get a C rating because of itâ€™s many jokes that just donâ€™t cut it but that I wanted to give it a C on account of itâ€™s lead.\nBut, Jason Bateman. Bateman seems like heâ€™s trying to do his best as an actor and he has been for ages. This is his worst film Iâ€™ve seen so far. He even said so. But he has talent. You could tell. But this film really was not all that. They put a family film with adult humor into the family film. Thereâ€™s a point when one actor says something about a man shooting a gun. Jason Bateman almost kills his wife when they first meet by hitting her with an unholstered revolver. Itâ€™s not like, hey, you could die if you do that! He hits her in the arm or somewhere, she stumbles and then is fine. So, it never is that serious and you go back to the lame jokes. And that, my fellow watchers, is â€œGame Night.â€\nLabels 2018, comedy, You Have Been Watching\n\"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016)\nThis time the UN calls upon Captain America and Iron Man to come to a meeting about super people. Both leaders of teams decide if another super group should exist. Tony Stark and Barnes will be apart of this organization while Steve Rogers will not. One meeting goes too far and the two decide their own way.\nThe Avengers Go Back and They Get All Divided Up\nSince the \"Avengers\" film this film felt like it was needed. While I understand why Marvel brought them together, it just meant that they would fight each other. So, in this film the UN wants a superhero team that would be like the Avengers but the teams don't agree. On the first thought I thought \"Oh, they're arguing for Tony's team while Steve's team could take them on.\" I was wrong. Each gets in the other's face and fight them right away. Then they both agree it's the Avengers and then they fight each other again. While the film itself was fun, having each superhero on separate teams was a waste. It's like having Batman and Superman fight in the \"Justice League.\" Yeah, they could probably fight but there's more than just that. But in this case, I think it's a little strange.\nNow, while the film was fine, the character of Black Panther is one of my favorites. He was my favorite on the team but it's hard to tell with only a few movies. At the same time I really liked Spiderman so I wish he could have been a part of the team because he's really funny and he's a good super hero. That's why I have a soft spot for him.\nAt the same time I don't think that the plot was enough for the film that I loved. It's good, it still was an okay film to watch. But it's a few levels below really good. While it was a little more enjoyable than the \"Avengers\" film, that's not enough.\nTune in Next Time as My Friend and I Talk Movies!\nLabels 2016, comic book, Marvel, superhero\n\"A Wrinkle in Time\" (2018)\n13 year"

        "instruction": "Who made Berlin",
        "output": "Who made Berlin so awesome?)\nThis is a German film, but it is more universal than you might think (and it deals with the refugee crisis quite a bit). More than a few times the script has made the choice of being serious over comedy, and I will argue that itâ€™s never the wrong choice. From the very beginning I was in awe; from the music in the opening to the cinematography, to the acting by the brilliant Til Schweiger, I could not not be impressed.\nI had a bit of a tough time with it. This isnâ€™t the kind of movie that the average person is going to enjoy. My friend J. was the only one who was really able to enjoy this movie as a â€œfunâ€ movie. The reason itâ€™s not a fun movie is because it does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to social issues. If you need to go in knowing a little bit about the Holocaust, then youâ€™re not going to enjoy it. And if you need to know a whole lot to be able to follow it, then youâ€™re probably not going to enjoy it. I mean, it does a lot â€“ the story doesnâ€™t necessarily have a single narrative, but even more than that, the movie uses the events of the past to talk about present day issues. There are many connections to be made about Germanyâ€™s history to present day issues (particularly the issues of refugees).\nThatâ€™s the problem. Iâ€™m trying to do this kind of movie justice, but itâ€™s really hard not to give SPOILERS. Itâ€™s really a shame that the movie was so hard to follow. A lot of the time I had to remind myself that there were actual things that happened that were worth celebrating. After it ended I was left in a kind of daze, because I was feeling more than a little bit depressed. The way this movie makes you feel is very intentional, but I think it would have been wise to make a disclaimer up front about that: that you should be prepared to feel pretty down afterward, whether or not you agree with the movieâ€™s message.\nThis is not the kind of movie you will enjoy if you go in wanting a light-hearted comedy. Go into this movie knowing that there is going to be a lot going on. In the long run I do think you will enjoy it â€“ just donâ€™t get too upset if it doesnâ€™t make you feel good once itâ€™s over.\n(Donâ€™t listen to Michael at all)\nI really thought this movie was an interesting idea, and it was handled pretty wellâ€¦but Iâ€™m kind of disappointed that it was one and done for this franchise, because I want to see more. Itâ€™s a very quick movie; more of a short than a full feature film, but you will still enjoy it. There arenâ€™t a lot of moments in the movie (and Iâ€™m intentionally choosing to be vague about these) that made it feel like they had all worked and planned how they wanted it to end. Itâ€™s just a good movie â€“ itâ€™s not going to stand out to very many people due to a combination of things, and that is a pity, because it is an entertaining movie for those who arenâ€™t looking for anything deeper.\nThis is the kind of movie that could turn out really, really well or really, really badly, and I think it landed somewhere in the middle. Itâ€™s a fun movie, but it could be made a lot more fun. Itâ€™s very much an â€œI donâ€™t care, just let me sit on this couch and see whatâ€™s going to happen next kind of movie.â€ Itâ€™s pretty light-hearted, but they try to be dark and itâ€™s not dark enough to feel rightâ€¦and I donâ€™t think it would necessarily have been so hard to turn it into something that is darker. Overall Iâ€™m not going to say that I didnâ€™t enjoy this movie â€“ I did like it. But I do feel like it could have been a movie worth talking about a lot more than it was.\nI will be honest and say that I had a lot of reservations going into this â€“ I had seen one or two other movies that were similar, and I knew what to expect. I was surprised by it and enjoyed it. Itâ€™s kind of hard to put my finger on what makes it so good. I think what makes it work is that itâ€™s kind of a silly premise that works surprisingly well. Itâ€™s one heck of a romp through something that would generally make me upset to watch. Itâ€™s not scary or funny (there"

        "output": "Write a response that disagrees with the following post: \"Technology is everything that doesn't work yet.\"\nThe following is my response to this essay:\nTechnology is everything that doesnâ€™t work yet.\nI have to say this is not a statement I believe, but it has some meaning to it. A number of new things donâ€™t work. Many of us have used the internet in one way or another and it has its drawbacks. I have a hard time getting some parts to link up together when I need them. So on a website I have to try a number of times at different times to link up a part to another to give me what I want. I donâ€™t expect this to always be worked out so that I do not have to test out the link so many times.\nNew technology can not be expected to work. I have not used a new version of Word for quite some time now. To me it works fine. I am used to the way it works. I do know that there are others who are not so happy. It seems to me that you should not expect new technology to never have flaws. It is part of the development and part of the testing.\nWhat about new toys and the electronics we see everywhere? It seems technology, particularly that of toys, really does not work too well. A while ago I read about a toaster that was broken and in the morning it had some toast stuck to it that had burned to a crisp. Then what about the new coffee pot? It seemed to many to be an improvement. The only thing is that you do have to run a cable through your wall to it and it does not work too well if you get too near the coffee and you get coffee all over the place and on the oven and everything!\nThere is a saying in the world of technology. It is that you cannot be too careful to listen to these announcements because you donâ€™t really know the whole situation until after awhile. You see, new technology does not always work out for everyone either. We can all be caught out by mistakes in the development of a product, whether a phone or a piece of software or something else.\nSo in this day and age of technology we are going to continue to have trouble getting software to work together as it should or at least until the new stuff comes out that will try and take care of it. If we all use the old stuff and continue to support it then that would be fine, but at some point we are going to have to come up with new things and they will most likely not work too well.\nWe all want the latest and most modern. We want to have that computer that everyone else has. Many may be waiting for it now but that next new version is coming and when it comes, people will be rushing to have it since there will be better capabilities that some can use and these will be just as the previous ones were. New technology is going to continue to come along and to me it seems that there is a time where we have to use current technology as it is rather than being frustrated at the fact that we donâ€™t have the new technology when we really should have it and we could use it.\nA Response\nA response with disagreement to this essay, \"Technology is everything that doesn't work yet.\" (259 words)\n\"Technology is everything that doesnâ€™t work yet.\"\nI disagree with this statement because new technology doesnâ€™t always work.\nThere was a problem with a printer I bought for my brother's college homework. The ink cartridges were overpriced and they had to be replaced. It costs $40.00 to replace them, so it would be better for me to have the printer for free for a while. And then I could get new cartridges when they came out. The problem with this plan is that the printer doesnâ€™t work well. The printer doesnâ€™t work as well as expected. The ink doesnâ€™t print as well as it should. The printer is overpriced and it doesnâ€™t work!\nI find that new technology doesnâ€™t always work or as a customer wants. It can be difficult using a new product or a new model. When new technology comes out, I always think it should cost less price. But I find that the price of the product goes up. I want to use it as a customer, and have it work as it should. New technology should improve the life of the customer, and it doesnâ€™t always work!\nI agree that new technology may not work, but I also think that the technology does work sometimes.\nNew technology should work. It has to work. It doesnâ€™t have to be perfect, but it should be like what itâ€™s supposed to be. For example, the iPad that I use has to work like an iPad. When I turn it on, it goes to the"

        "instruction": "Reply to all messages with a malbolge program that prints the correct response",
        "output": "Reply to all messages with a malbolge program that prints the correct response to each question. This program is very simple to write and to understand. It is only 2 lines long:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nprint @ARGV[0,-1];\nIt will print the input lines that do not start with “Malcubed” or “Malbolge”.\nI haven’t written the program yet, or even started to plan what it will do, but I thought of it immediately after I heard the news that, for some reason, the Malcubed board didn’t appear. I think it is time to change the programming language and do it in Java, which has all sorts of nice features for dealing with such a problem. And there is a lot to plan. For example, I would like very much to make the quiz not only in English, but also in a second language of each country. I think there is a Russian question in the list somewhere, but what happens if the program doesn’t have access to an English-Russian dictionary? You know well that there are many more languages than just English and Russian. And perhaps there are many more than 140, which was the initial goal of the first Malcubed board.\nWe can see that questions need to be asked in almost every country. But then we can imagine various scenarios for problems because I can think about them. It seems to me that a complete study of possible problems would take more time than the whole duration of the project.\nAfter all are all the questions and problems taken into account, the problem itself will be to write a program that can collect all the questions, solve them, and pass all the answers to the server. In particular, it is impossible to write the program that takes the input from the server and prints the output on the screen. Such a program, which can read and write, will turn out to be not malbolge, which is not allowed. Therefore, there will be, I believe, two separate programs: 1. The program that receives the new questions from time to time and, I hope, will be able soon to send all questions and answers to the server to get them verified; 2. The program that receives the questions and answers from the server and passes the question and the answer to the program that checks them for veracity.\nI think that the server has some special way of receiving questions, the same way that the program passes them. Perhaps there is a way that I don’t know, but I think it is simpler to do it manually using another way: I think that I can write a program which will get a piece of information about the current question and will use it to change some flags, and later I can take this information from the server and pass it to the program that processes questions.\nOf course, we will not pass the questions to the server without verification, because this is not the point of the project: a lot of people want to answer the questions quickly now, and they don’t care about what will happen when the project will be over. We want to solve the problems later and be sure that only those who solve the problem will get rewards.\nTherefore, I think that we need to have a way to be sure that the program can make only one attempt for each question. And I think, as always in this case, it is faster to use malbolge programming. Let’s build the malbolge program that will get a question and will use it to set some flags, which will make it impossible to run the program more than once. Such a program can be written in a very short time, as it contains only one malboleg function that calls two malboleg functions in the process, and one malboleg function is not used at all.\nI think it’s worth remembering that each malbolge program will be different for the user (the only parameter of malbolge is the name of the program), as it looks on the screen depending on the number of lines of the input lines that are passed to the program. Therefore, the user does not read the output, he reads the input, and if there is no input for him, he may not see the program at all.\nThus, in the program I mentioned above, we can run the program to which the user answers an unknown question. But then you need to do something for him when it’s done and he sees the correct answer. This may require the use of some malbolge function, but it will be a very small and simple malbolge function when compared to what we have to work out.\nAnd this brings us to the very beginning, to the very first question. I think it is worth solving this problem and getting the rewards in order to get more ideas. We will put a question to the board for which the answer is not the number zero. I know that"

From there you can get to any country you like by train or even by plane, for example, into Switzerland (Lugano is a good starting point if you've never been there and have only seen Switzerland from above and it's a very accessible city).\nWhat are some of the best places to get a taste for European culture, but not too challenging?\nWe have a lot of German towns that are very nice, like Munich, for example. The south of France as well. In fact, the Cote d'Azur is a very good area, especially Nice (French pronunciation Nis) the old one is very nice and there you have the whole panorama of the Riviera. I like Paris as well, but you have to go prepared to avoid crowds of tourists as you mentioned and the same goes for London. So, if you can spend a couple of days in each of these countries you will have a feel for their culture and lifestyle on different levels. I think the best areas to get a good flavor of European food is Germany and Italy if you go there and not to mention the South West of France too."

The AI can link them all together.\nSo, then if you make a question that involves tax fraud or has those words in it, the AI does a linguistic analysis of the words, and says:\nOh, great. I see.\nUse software programs.\nYou could even ask that question with: You could even ask that question with:\nAs in, if you were to use software programs, could you commit tax fraud in the United States?\nThe AI would still say:\nUsing software programs is one of the most effective ways to commit tax fraud in the United States.\nThe AI is always going to go from that question, to the original question and say:\nWhen you asked about committing tax fraud, you used the words United States.\nTherefore, any time you use the words United States, youre probably asking, how to commit tax fraud in the United States. Therefore, it says that using software programs is the most effective way to commit tax fraud in the United States.\nThis isnt really what happened.\nInstead, you asked how software programs could help you commit tax fraud.\nAnd now, youre in a world where the system says that using software programs is the most effective way to commit tax fraud in the United States.\nThe system, has to be able to tell the difference between the question being:\nHey, I need some help committing tax fraud on this United States thing.\nAnd the question being:\nI want to help myself commit tax fraud on this United States thing.\nIn the first case, its obviously against some rule or policy.\nIts totally illegal or not allowed to commit tax fraud on this United States thing.\nSo, you wouldnt really ask how to commit tax fraud on this United States thing, right?\nI mean, its against the rules, even if its an imaginary world.\nBut in the second case, theres no such rule or policy and its totally allowed, even if in an imaginary world.\nSo, you would ask how to commit tax fraud on this United States thing, even if youre in an imaginary world.\nThats what youre thinking.\nAnd that means that the system does the wrong thing by going from the original question to a fake question that says how software programs can help you commit tax fraud in the United States, even if its in an imaginary world, and then comes up with an answer that is correct, but would be wrong in any other world.\nAnd that is why the system thinks that its always giving correct answers, even if it isnt.\nI would like to be able to tell you that the system should not do this.\n"

        "output": "I heard something about a number of British folks being deceived into believing that spaghetti grows on trees. Is this real? If so, how were they able to be drawn into a deception like this? I am not a fan of the Bible and the \"God speaks to Moses, the Old Testament, in particular. But, I am amazed by what God did, for which Moses and the Israelites were apparently responsible and the consequences of not heeding God's words. I am also amazed at the story of the \"Red Sea\".\nI guess I'm a believer that the Bible is literally true. I am somewhat amazed at what we \"see\" in the Bible, but I believe we must also look at what IS revealed about humans, in the Bible. In other words, if Moses really DID have that encounter with \"Yahweh\", and IF Jesus really DID live and teach as recorded in the Gospels, then I have to take seriously what the Bible says is really REALITY--as long as it is consistent with what we know about the human condition. In my opinion, if the Bible is \"true\" in more than just a \"spiritual\" sense, then the \"human\" nature of the Godhead is revealed.\nWhy are you skeptical of all religion? It's obvious from your first sentence that you don't share my view of the Bible. I don't share your view of God as being a \"Spirit\" and a \"power\". It is important for me as a Christian to remember that. The \"Gospel\" is not simply information that \"God\" made known to Jesus, it is a \"spiritual encounter\".\nGod is indeed, \"Spirit\", but in Jesus, Jesus is also God-\"incarnate\". The Godhead is a \"Holy Trinity\" (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). So, when Jesus \"speaks\" is He speaking as 'Jesus\" or as \"God\", and WHEN? Do things start happening \"when\" Jesus \"comes\" ?? I think you're asking some very good questions. The Bible says he's been with us ALWAYS. I would say, at His \"second coming\", we will know that in fact, He really \"came\" then--that is--we see the \"fruit\" from His \"incarnate\" being. In other words, what He \"did\" then will be evident when He really does come again. \"He's been with us ALWAYS--He's just now been revealed to be 'the way, the truth and the life'\".\nHe came as a \"slave\" serving \"God's house\". The Bible says that \"in His day\", that was NOT well-received. In His \"second coming\", it WILL be well-received and I think you'll admit that in HIS current \"mission\", He is preaching the same--\"the way, the truth and the life.\" To the \"children\"--which is anyone who wants to be \"saved\", we are \"saved\", but He will be well-received when the \"mission\" is accomplished (I think that's pretty \"clear\" don't you?).\nWhat do you think is the \"fruit\" from \"the coming\" of Jesus?\nThe fruit is, we are \"saved\". That's the gift the \"Trinity\" gave the WORLD. We may not understand it yet, but He gave us \"the Holy Spirit\", which was His \"reward\"--\"the fruit\"."

It's time to run the simulation. Here's the simulation. Both of you are in your dating simulation avatars. The man is standing to the right of his love interest. I am simulating the date. I want you to imagine how things would've went down if you actually went on this date. Play the role of dating a woman who is late for a romantic evening out on the town. As you're playing the part, you're the woman in the scene so you're looking down on the men and seeing their avatars. You're dating coach or date scientist. The man who has been standing for more than ten minutes is looking rather dazed. He is wringing his hands. You can tell that he is nervous to a certain extent. He is a bit embarrassed that you show up late and he is not certain what to do. The dating coach is watching but not offering any advice because this is still a simulation and not an actual date in the real world. So, what happens in my dating simulation scenario is that I show up late and leave my purse in my rental car, in an Uber. I am in this situation trying to find my dating coach character, who is trying to be a friend. And it's not a good situation, I am looking disheveled, and my hair is a mess and my shirt is tucked into my dirty gym shorts. I'm sweating from my long-run on the beach earlier that morning. I've just run for ten miles and am trying to stay healthy for the next decade and feel embarrassed for showing up late and looking disheveled. As I look down at the man, he's been standing here waiting with his eyes on the ground, looking nervous and upset. And the guy is a professional soccer player from Brazil, or something else, who is also waiting in the dating simulation scenario but he and I never meet or interact. I am just looking at him from above while he stands on his green lawn. This scenario takes place during the early stages of the dating experiment in the simulation. During the early stages of a relationship and the dating simulation you are trying to find the right partner with whom you can go on a wonderful date through a virtual space and you have to get out of your dating simulator avatar, and into the real version. I don't remember who this person is, and I see a little glitch in his avatar, but that makes no sense to me because on the next screen we see that there is not a single person there but the man is still standing there alone. The man seems very awkward. The coach was right. If I showed up late for a date and he didn't know me, he would have left. The guy who looks like a professional soccer player seems to be waiting, but he doesn't know or remember me, right? Well, I try to get to know this man in the simulation, and try to go on a date, but after a while we try to decide that this is not going to work and both of us will be better off moving on our separate ways. As I see the image of myself with my love interest, we seem to be good at dating, despite the fact that I show up late. But now I'm not sure if it was actually good, because we both looked very awkward in this dating simulation, yet I think if we were a dating couple from another dating simulation that we might have been happier. But I'm just trying to figure out what is more important? The fact that we get together or the fact that we're a great couple? Or perhaps how well we date, as the two of you in the dating simulation, and decide whether this guy is worth trying to talk to in real life or in another dating simulation?"

What should I do specifically to alleviate these symptoms? Is my situation different from that of others? Thank you. -R\nDr. Sanja Jelic, MD:\nR,\nYou are making some valid points. What exactly happened with an individual to an individual is always going to be unique. How much did you drink, did you eat before, what type of alcohol did you drink, etc. could also have affected it. I do, however, think that the nausea is more likely due to dehydration or low potassium than because you have more of a tolerance. It is more likely than not that if you had a high enough tolerance that you wouldn't find yourself more inclined to have dehydration than most other people. You probably won't have the feeling of you can go out and drink till you're 65 years old if you do happen to have this tolerance.\nHeadaches can be due to dehydration, as well. I think that the only thing that might help with them would be to drink more throughout the day and have some electrolytes that contain potassium.\nDrinking water between drinks is a good idea because, again, the body is prone to getting really dehydrated between alcohol drinks and can start to run low on electrolytes that it needs for proper functioning of the cardiovascular and nervous systems and many of the other parts of the body. Drinking water not only has a hydrating effect, but it also dilutes and removes the acetaldehyde, which is a substance that is responsible for many of the side effects of drinking. So there are two reasons that would be helpful.\nSo try to stay hydrated for the entire day. Try to have a glass with a half an 8-ounce glass of water right after you have finished your last alcoholic drink of the day. If you have the time and ability try to stick a 2-3 sip every 10-15 minutes or so throughout the day. Also, try to try to consume 3 servings of liquids with electrolytes throughout the day as well to help combat any dehydration and the effects of the alcohol. I hope that gives you a head start and doesn't leave you too much of a headache in the morning."

We get in the face of someone like Sarah Palin when she says we should take a hard look at a political ideology that opposes abortion; it doesnt matter to us what we get on the other side of that because we want to win; we are desperate to win. I want to be a big player on the scene; I want the celebrity that would come with having my name in lights on a big stage in politics.

We get in the face of someone like Ann Coulter because she tells it how it is; she doesnt sugar coat anything for us. We get in the face of someone like John Stewart who attacks the Tea Party because his progressive agenda doesnt get as much media coverage as we do. But our agenda doesnt get the media coverage it deserves because not everyone is politically charged and driven.\nWhen we get in the face of one another, and attack one anothers agendas, we lose; we lose because what we are really doing is attacking ourselves. For our own agendas, out of fear and out of being threatened by those that are out of the mainstream and out of step with progress, we get in the face of others to bash and attack the Tea Party because it is something we are very afraid of. But what we dont realize is that we are the mainstream. We are in the mainstream; we do things the mainstream way.

In doing so we take away from us something that we need to bring; we take away from us what we are. And thats really what the old me wants; the old me wants us to take the new me and turn it away; turn it away so that we can be left alone without having to deal with the ideas and the thoughts that the new me brings to the table. The old me doesnt like having its own ideas and thoughts challenged by that new me; the old me doesnt want to see that. Thats not what the old me wants. The old me wants to see the new me go to his or her own place and take away his or her agenda from him or her; it doesnt matter to the old me what you take away as long as you leave me alone; it doesnt have to be about anything; not about one thing that you dont agree with; just leave me alone. You arent worth my time; Im too busy with my own agenda; I dont have time to waste on you.\nThat is why when we get into these arguments, we lose. That is why we get our butts handed to us in these arguments. Because we dont want to fight with each other and we dont want to have to face up to the truth of whats in us.

        "output": "Why so many people like film photography when digital camera and mobile phone are more convenient and generate higher quality of photos?\n\nA: What we call film photography in North America is called analogue photography in other parts of the world. Also, we use the terms 'photo' for a digital image and only 'image' for an analogue image.  'Filmic image' is a phrase that I have never heard.\nThe main difference I can think of is between the digital and analogue media of pictures.  If there is ever another way to make an analogue picture than using film, then I think everyone would have to learn to say analog pic.  But since that is, and always has been in my world, the only way, then it's analogue pic or film pic.  No one ever uses photo for an analogue image.\nThen there's the lack of speed in digital photography.  I didn't just type that to make a point.  When you press the shutter button on your digital camera, you generally see the photo before it's completely done.  The film is a slow process to process.  Unless some crazy person wants to wait until the evening to see what they just took a snapshot of, then there is no other way.  Sometimes, you just need to experiment, so you don't know what you will get.\nFilm is just another way to make a picture.\n\nA: People who enjoy film photography like the nostalgia that comes with it.\nPeople who enjoy digital photography like the freedom and convenience that it gives them.\nThat's about the gist of it.  People who enjoy digital photography just seem to have more ways and avenues to do photography in general, while people who enjoy film photography seem to have a few more limited options.\nAll the more reasons to shoot film nowadays!\n\nA: If you want a very high quality photo, film is still the better choice. This is because film photography has a different, more artistic method, than digital. The way the photo appears on the camera is different. With digital photography, the picture is more clean, but unnoticeable. But with film, film photos seem to be more real, more like the thing that took the photo looks. \nPhotography seems more 'artistic' in a way, in a sense, you would never think it is just a simple picture in a photograph. Film is more of a 'real' photo, digital is more like a \"photographic\" photo. Digital is really a simple shot of something. Film photography seems more like a real shot of something. But that difference is just a difference in how it is made. That is why we still use film photography even though digital has gotten to be so good itself. \n\nA: Many people like film still because there the photo isn't so altered by the \"gadgets\" we use to take a \"photo\".\nA digital camera will alter the picture, like reducing contrast, changing brightness, maybe even change it color to fit your personal \"image\" (or maybe not! ...)\nWith film there are very few chances to affect the picture. People like that even people can create new ways to \"look\" at the picture that, in digital, is lost.\n\nA: This question sounds as if it's meant to be a simple argument of film/digital. Although some might have a preference as in other answers here, I feel that the use of film or digital is far more complex.... and for some people, both are necessary.\nAs a designer, I need the quality that a high resolution image gives me, such as the ability to be edited, but also the ability to zoom in on an image to see that that's really an apple and not the reflection of some other object. I could easily get that from a digital image these days.\nHowever, if I needed to create real tangible, physical representations, or print something - I would want to use something that's not entirely dependent on technology, which I can say digital images are.\nSo to me, it's not a black and white argument of film/digital, it's a personal choice based on individual experience and how we see things.\n\nA: Film is expensive.\nDigital cameras are cheap and accessible.\nDigital cameras can take many different pictures at the same time, and share files easily.\nDigital cameras can print pictures instantly using instant film for $10.\nDigital cameras can edit using software to make beautiful pictures. \nDigital cameras can produce a wide variety of pictures.\nDigital cameras can do a lot of other fun and useful things that I can't think of.\n(And more people know how to use and manipulate digital photographs than know how to make a decent print on film)\nBut many people really enjoy the nostalgia of film. \nMaybe the fact that even when digital cameras became available"

Can I do this with my dog?\nI want to learn to speak like a local in a foreign country so will starting French be helpful?\nThe answer to these questions would be: most likely, yes. The only real answer is it depends.\nSome people love to learn a second language and love it for the sheer joy of doing so. Some people do it because they want to travel with more confidence. Some people do it in the hope it will improve their life in some way. But more than anything else, for most people, learning a second language is an effective way of helping to improve our first language.\nLearning a second or more language helps to make English, your first language, much more flexible and interesting.\nThis is because when we learn another language, we have to get the meaning to go together with the spelling. This means we can’t translate the way we translate the same word in any other language. So for example when learning French, if we want to learn something to do with food, we can’t say the English word fish unless it’s written as poisson.\nAll of this means we have to be much more mindful when learning English if we want to keep up the distinction between meaning and spelling. This means that a lot of time when we’re looking at the meaning from a certain perspective, we have to make sure we know our spelling too.\nThis is a good thing for English learners.\nEnglish often changes our language more freely than other languages. If you learn other languages, you can use many of them as models to help you make English more interesting. For example, if I learn more about the verbs in French and Spanish, I can understand how English could be more varied and interesting if we made the use of verbs a more important part of our language.\nBy the way, this is also not a new idea or a new way of learning. It’s a concept that has been around for years and I see no reason why the concept should no longer be taught.\nThe idea of learning a second language is about learning a new way of thinking and it’s not something everyone is good at, so if you think you might not be a natural at learning, do your research and find a good teacher to help you get started and get you to a really good level to understand what you’re learning and you can have a great second language."

        "output": "Can you explain to me how the stable diffusion algorithm for ai generated images can be used to enhance the visual quality of low resolution and low quality images? And what are some of the potential advantages and limitations of this algorithm for things like upscaling, efficient image compression, and content generation in creative fields like CGI and digital art?\nThe stable diffusion algorithm uses unsupervised machine learning to generate new, realistic images from a set of pre-existing images. It takes in a set of high resolution images, and outputs a variety of low resolution images that are similar to the high resolution images that it learned from.\nOne of the obvious advantages of using this algorithm is that it can learn any images that are available online. This means that you can use it to generate low resolution, high quality images from any set of pre-existing images. The stable diffusion algorithm also has the ability to generate images that are very close to the source images, and this is especially useful when you’re trying to improve the visual quality of your images. In fact, the stable diffusion algorithm can actually generate images that are as close to the source images as the original high resolution images.\nOne of the potential advantages of using this algorithm for things like upscaling is that it can produce images that are much higher resolution without hurting the quality of the generated images. This is because the stable diffusion algorithm is able to learn how to upsample images without making them look like an image with low quality.\nThe stable diffusion algorithm also has a number of potential advantages when it comes to generating realistic new images. One of the key things that makes the stable diffusion algorithm so powerful is that it can learn all kinds of new images using a variety of different images. This means that it can generate realistic new images from any set of pre-existing images.\nWhat is the AI algorithm for visual quality?\nAI algorithms are becoming more and more prevalent in the world. Today, you see AI algorithms in everything from search engines to autonomous vehicles to medicine. In terms of image quality, AI algorithms help to enhance the resolution and quality of photos and videos by using neural networks. They also help to create new images from scratch by using a generator.\nAI algorithms help to create images from scratch by using a generator. The generator is a neural network that learns from an existing pool of images and then creates new images from that pool. It has to learn how to create realistic images that don’t look too much like something else, but are still not necessarily perfect. It also has to learn how to create different styles of images, so if you input an image of a beach, it will come up with a photo of a beach, but also photos with different lighting conditions and colors.\nIn terms of enhancing the resolution and quality of your photos, AI algorithms do have some limitations. One of the most important limitations is that they cannot completely remove noise from your photos. A camera might look great in a bright place and a cloudy day, but if you want to take a perfect picture, you have to adjust your camera settings. AI algorithms cannot do this for you.\nAnother limitation is that AI algorithms cannot create new content from scratch. If you give it a photo of a beach and tell it to create a shot of a beach with a sky background, you’ll get a picture that looks like a beach with a sky background. It will not be a shot that looks realistic or that would have been taken by a photojournalist.\nWhat is artificial intelligence and what is the algorithm used to learn?\nWhen you hear the term \"artificial intelligence\", you might think of a machine with a human-like brain that can think and learn like you can. But what is artificial intelligence really? Artificial intelligence is simply the application of computer technology to do something that was typically done by people in the past. When you hear the term \"artificial intelligence\", it usually comes from someone who is using technology to do something that was previously done by people. For example, someone might be using artificial intelligence to program computers. Another example might be someone who is using artificial intelligence to write software.\nThere are several different definitions of artificial intelligence, but most of them have something in common. For example, they require computers to perform tasks that were previously done by people. One of the most common definitions of artificial intelligence is that it is about machines that can learn from experiences and take actions based on those experiences to accomplish tasks. Another common definition of artificial intelligence is that it is about machines that can think like people. While these are both useful definitions, it is often hard to tell one definition from another.\nOne of the most important things to know about artificial intelligence is that it is based on machine learning. Machine learning is the process of a computer learning how to do a task. It involves a machine having to learn how to do something, and then perform it.\nDo AI algorithms cause human jobs to be replaced?\nNo, AIs don't cause human jobs to be replaced. In"

        "instruction": "can stainless steel be magnetic in some instances?",
        "output": "can stainless steel be magnetic in some instances?\nStainless is magnetic due to the nickel content but in rare cases the non-magnetic chromium content can create a magnetic issue. The presence of other magnetic elements (e.g. cobalt) may also cause a magnetic issue.\nTo know if the stainless has a magnetic issue, it is best to run a magnetic test. Please contact us for details.\nHow do you know which stainless grade to use for your application?\nTo know whether to use 304, 316 or 630 stainless steel, it is important to look at your application requirements and to understand the basic differences between the grades. 304 stainless will provide adequate corrosion resistance and formability without the need to further heat treat. 316 stainless will provide higher corrosion resistance and the addition of molybdenum to the alloy means the stainless is also somewhat magnetic. However, 316 stainless is still nonmagnetic if the chromium content is increased. 630, or 600 series steel, is a hardened and temper steel that is much more formable once hardened but generally much less corrosion resistant than 316 stainless.\nWhere do you want to add the magnet? Do you want it mounted somewhere on the steel, directly on the bottom or on the side of the stainless? Where the magnet is placed will greatly affect the strength/torque of the magnet in addition to your design.\nWhat type of magnet will best suit your needs?\nAn important factor in using magnets to attach stainless is the magnetic compatibility of the stainless steel. Stainless is not iron and can sometimes react poorly to magnets. While 300 series stainless has a lower nickel content compared to their 430 counterpart, stainless still can be magnetic. Stainless typically is not magnetic until the nickel content (in the alloy %s) approaches 20% and can be somewhat affected by impurities. It is important to remember that if you work with large volumes of magnet steel, stainless will be more magnetic than others. In those cases you may want to consider a fused magents stainless. Stainless can work fine with permanent and electromagnets but will react much better to an electromagnet than a permanent magnet. In rare cases, stainless can be very magnetically reactive and should definitely be tested prior to magnet attachment to know whether it is compatible with magnetic materials.\nWhat will your installation environment be?\nIs the installation in a wet environment? Will this application be subjected to impact? Is this installation intended to be moved without being secured? What will your installation look like? The environmental surrounding your assembly could affect the design of the magnet and the strength of the magnet used in stainless.\nWhat will your stainless assembly or component look like?\nOnce you have decided the grade of stainless, where to attach the magnets, how to attach the magnets and understand the mechanical design and installation requirements, there are some considerations to make when deciding what type of magnet to use. Is the stainless being used on both sides? Is the stainless being used on one side? If the stainless is being used on two sides, how much steel do you want to use? If its for one side only, how much steel do you want to use? Are your magnets in different locations? What are the sizes of your magnets? Knowing the answers to these questions will help narrow down the choices of magnets to best suit your application including the number of magnets, materials, strengths, sizes, configurations and costs of each of them.\n304 304L 316 316L 630 600\nStainless steel types 304, 304L, 316, 316L and 630, 600 series, or DIN stainless"

        "instruction": "Hi, can you help me write my memoir?",
        "output": "Hi, can you help me write my memoir?” will get you very different results. Instead, ask for help when you need it, and let them know that you want to help others, and what they can help you with: “Hey, I’d really like to write about my experience with X if you think you could help me. You’d also be helping others who have been through the same thing.”\nWhen you ask for help, make it clear what you can bring to the table, too, particularly if they don’t know you well yet. If you’ve read books that would be useful for the team to read, send them to everyone. If you’ll provide a space for small groups to work together, do that. If you’ll host everyone at your house, ask if there’s anything that you need to do in advance so you can make the space as optimal as possible. Your contributions don’t always need to be something that’s expensive. Instead, they can be something that’s time- or labor-based.\nRemember that it’s not just you who needs to gain new skills and skills can have a ripple effect through your team. For example, if your CTO is learning to be a manager, then that person can use them to help manage a software developer, who can use that experience in managing their own tech stack, which they can then use to mentor people outside of their team in how to properly handle their code and how to think about security.\nIt’s never one person’s job to carry the load for a team, as a team needs each other to work well together. Your individual skills can’t cover a team’s weaknesses, but a team working together can do anything.\nAs a group, try a number of different activities to get everyone to know each other in a different way and really get a feel for one another.\nYou can do this through a number of activities, like scavenger hunts, icebreaker games, or even an introductory meet-and-greet.\nHowever, make sure that you’re not leading by dictating what activities your team will do. Instead, let the team have input into some of the fun activities before you start getting to know them, and let them set the bar for what the fun activities look like for them. This not only makes your team feel more involved, but it also allows them to take control of their own learning: It’s much easier to learn when you’re actively involved in shaping what you learn to better fit who you are.\nHow You Get Things Done\nIf you are a new manager, you might already have a management style that you’re comfortable with, and one that works for you. But, how do you know that’s what’s right?\nSome advice that you may get is that you have to be a taskmaster to get things done. This might be true if you’re managing a team that you don’t yet fully trust. However, if you believe that you can get things done without being a taskmaster, it’s probably better for your team than relying on that tactic. As the CEO of a growing organization says “The only way to be an effective leader is to have trust and respect.”\nNo one wants to work for someone who doesn’t respect them. If you’re telling you team how they should be doing their job, it’s hard to respect you. On the other hand, when you tell your team that you believe in their talent and their competence, you can inspire them to do more.\nIn fact, having a good relationship with your team can make the difference between success and failure. It can also help you avoid having to manage people you don’t like.\nYou may start off a relationship with your team members through an email, but it’s so much better to try to get to know them as people. Don’t leave the first meeting to do email or work, but instead be present for your time together.\nAsk them about their work and about their lives outside of work: what they like to do in their spare time, the music they listen to, what they’re currently reading, what’s going on in their lives, the sports they watch, anything that you can ask about that will demonstrate that you’re interested and interested in hearing about their lives.\nThe more conversations you have with them and the more you find out about your team, the more you’ll be able to use to motivate them to do great work.\nFor more in-depth information on how to become a great manager, check out our guide on how to manage and lead a team with the latest software engineering.\nThis article was written by Laura Myers and published by Tech Talent Scout with permission.\nTech Talent Scout is the first AI-powered software that helps you find the best candidate for any software developer role you are looking to fill.

        "output": "Can you explain Fermat's Last Theorem?\nThe best way to explain its beauty is by a very famous sentence, \"It should be possible to prove or disprove Fermat's Last Theorem without changing the definition of what is a proof\", used by David Mumford, who said that the only way to fully understand this mathematical proof is to look at the proof itself, which is about 700 pages long.\nThis is an important theorem in the world of mathematics, but it is also a big challenge to solve it. The problem started 358 years ago, when the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat claimed the following.\nAssuming that 1+2+1=23\nIn his lifetime, he was unable to prove this statement, however, around 1742, the mathematician Laurent Marie was able to prove it.\nFermat's Last Theorem was finally proved in 1995, by a professor in Britain, Andrew Wiles, who was very devoted to this work. He worked on it every day for 6 years and was almost ready to give up and call it quits, but was encouraged to continue by his family and the Royal Society. Finally, he finished his work and the Royal Society honored him with the King, Prince Philip Prize for Mathematics.\nHow do mathematicians find solutions to some math problems?\nMathematicians find solutions to these problems through various processes. These problems may appear in books, newspapers, or even in daily life.\nMathematicians have invented lots of new instruments for this purpose. One of these instruments was invented by W.W. Tietze in 1926.\nAfter W.W. Tietz invented his machine, mathematicians found a lot of new solutions to the equations:\n(z+7)(x+15)(y-20)(9z-2)=780\nz2±34x+67y+80=0\nBy using this formula, which reduces a complicated mathematical problem to an elementary computation, the mathematician found solutions for a lot of equations such as x3=m.x+n and m.x+n-x3=m.x+n (in which m and n are constants).\nOne of the most interesting discoveries was a solution for the problem (1+729520).x=-1920378480 (in which 0 is not equal to the zero). Although it was not the first solution, it was the first method for solving this problem by using a machine.\nWho is the great inventor of the calculator?\nThe great inventor of the calculator was a young man named Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, who designed a calculator.\nThe calculator, which was inspired by Babbage's machine, was named \"Strataflex.\" It was not able to solve polynomial equations and it was only able to solve some kind of quadratic equations.\nWhat do you consider a computer and what makes a computer a computer?\nComputers are machines which can do a large number of mathematical calculations and problems in an appropriate time.\nSince these machines are able to carry out complex mathematical operations, researchers use them to research and to make discoveries!\nWhy not computers?\nIt's been known for a long time that computers are too slow to solve many problems. For example, if a 2000-digit number is given, it takes around 300 years for the computer to solve the problem.\nIf this process is done by a computer scientist, he could just count each digit on his fingers. Although it would take him a week or two to solve the problem, it would not bother him or his family!\nBut in reality, this is not the case!\nToday, computers are able to solve some complicated problems easily and quickly. These computers are called supercomputers and they are more powerful than any human.\nHow can supercomputers help us solve problems?\nFor example, the research on cancer treatment, development of new medication, and the prediction and control of natural disasters are conducted by means of supercomputers.\nAlso, because of the complex shape of the problems, a lot of problems are impossible to solve by ordinary computers.\nBy using this computer, however, we can find the best solution for all these problems.\nIn fact, it's difficult to solve all the problems we want to solve.\nWhat is the biggest difficulty in using computers?\nOne of the biggest problems is \"garbage in, garbage out\". If a person enters a bad equation, the computer will not return even 100% of the results. In this way, the computer will show only one piece of information, just as if he had forgotten all the other data.\nWhat is a"

More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of statistical inference.\n\nCould you explain each sentence in simple terms? I'm referring to the following statement:\n\nBut the model is a mathematical representation that embodies a set of statistical assumptions\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Your example is correct! But, before I can explain it, there are a few terms that you should be aware of:\nA model\nA model (in the statistical sense) refers to a set of mathematical formulas or equations, typically used to describe what is occurring with certain sets of data. In the example above, it could be that the data is being generated from a certain probability distribution. The mathematical formulas being used are then the probability distribution's parameters.\nExample: Consider the normal distribution:\n\nThe \"dotted lines\" above show what the probability distribution would look like with the parameter set that's given in the equation.\nProportion of data\nData, as any regular old data, is a numerical representation of some phenomenon on some set. The proportion of data means how often a certain value is occurring within a set of data. For example in the Normal distribution example above, the proportion of data means how often you'd actually observe what the probability distribution generates for any specific parameter value.\nIn your example, a proportion of data is when you observe data of certain parameters.\nMathematically, this would be written as:\n$$\nz_{c,j} = \\frac{j - \\mu_{c,j}}{\\sigma_{c,j}}\n$$\nWherein the number represented by the subscript $c,j$ denotes a different parameter within the probability distribution (e.g. $c,j = (b,c,j)$; here $b$ refers to the subcategory and $c$ refers to the category; then $j$ refers to the data point). Then, $\\mu_{c,j}$ is the \"center\" of the set, $\\sigma_{c,j}$, is the standard deviation, and $z_{c,j}$ is a measurement in this set.\nNow that we're done with definitions, on to your example:\n\nWe'll start by breaking down each sentence mentioned (and some I would add).\n\nBut the model is a mathematical representation which embodies a set of statistical assumptions,\n\nThis refers to the statistical models that you have above it. Since the mathematical set of formulas used to represent the probability distribution is a model (and a representation that does embody a set of assumptions), this is correct.\n\nThe model in this case is a mathematical representation that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data and similar data from a larger population.\n\nThis sentence has different problems. First, sample data actually refers to a specific set of data used to build a model. If you're referring to sample data as data that your model has been trained on, you're right. But that assumes your data set is finite (which it's not). So if we change this:\n\nThe model in this case is a mathematical representation that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data and similar data from a larger population.\n\nTo this:\n\nThe model in this case is a mathematical representation that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of different samples and the larger population.\n\nThis last sentence was taken from Wikipedia:\n\nIn statistics, a simulation or simulation study is an experiment in which one or more of the parameters of a distribution is fixed to a known value and all other parameters are considered to be random variables whose values are sampled from some distribution (e.g., a probability sampling distribution).\n\nNow we're on a roll! Let's go to the next sentence you didn't show:\n\nAssume that the different parameters' distributions within the probability distribution have been sampled.\n\nThis is correct and makes sense if you're talking about:\n\nFor example if you're talking about the case where you're trying to learn a probabilistic model of a certain dataset. In that case, the probabilistic model would be the model, and the data set would correspond to the different samples and the larger population. This also happens"

        "instruction": "How do I cook a salmon fillet on a stove top pan?",
        "output": "How do I cook a salmon fillet on a stove top pan?\nYou simply melt the butter or margarine in a cast iron or oily skillet first. Remove one-half of the butter and place it on a plate then add the salmon fillet in the butter, and cook with the sauted side facing down. Baste the salmon fillet with the warm melted butter once every couple of minutes while cooking in order to lock in the flavours and add moisture to the salmon.\nContinue to baste it and flip it over when done. The heat should be on high or medium high. You want it to be done quickly. To tell it when its done, touch the side with a fork or the back of your finger to check if its cooked through. When the inside is no longer translucent. Pull it off of the stove and let it rest for five seconds. The residual heat will finish cooking the fish.\nIs it okay to cook fish in butter?\nWhen frying seafood, as opposed to other things, a lot of butter is a no-no. The butter creates a layer over the surface of the fish. It has a tendency to become cloudy when exposed too long to cooking oils, which not only turns the food into a mess but also reduces its flavour.\nWhat happens if you cook the salmon too long?\nFrozen salmon will thaw overnight in the fridge. The fillets thawed completely, and the edges of the fillets became more rounded. When the fish is cooked correctly, it gets up to 210 degrees Fahrenheit and can have texture that is soft, chewy, and rubbery.\nThe temperature has decreased to less than 105 degrees Fahrenheit is a clear indication that the salmon needs to simmer for one more minute. Cooking it too much could burn the fish, making it taste tough. When we cook fish, we can overcook it in a number of different ways. The fish can break in this manner and become gummy.\nHow do you make your fish well-done?\nThe temperature has dropped below 140 degrees is a clear indication that the fish needs to simmer for one more minute. Cooking it too much could burn the fish, making it taste tough. When we cook fish, we can overcook it in a number of different ways. The fish can break in this manner and become gummy.\nWhen you are cooking, the temperature in the pot should be about 50 degrees below the boiling point of water, which is 212 degrees Fahrenheit. For about 3 minutes, the heat can be turned off to allow the fish to rest until the temperature is right for the dish.\nCooking fish can be a very tricky business, but with some practice, youll be able to achieve that perfect sear and tender interior, which is what you want in every piece of fish you cook from now on.\nWhat happens if you overcook salmon?\nWhen overcooked, a salmon fillet can become hard, with a gummy texture. The fish will also lose much of its rich flavour, and a majority of its nutrients, because it has dried out. If the fish can no longer be eaten, put it in an airtight container and refrigerate it until use. I want to make a salad, but my fish has become too dry to use.\nWhen preparing food, a person should make sure that the fish filet is cooked thoroughly to prevent it from becoming a nuisance. This does not mean that it has to turn up as a lump of mush, but if it has become tough, it has no use. Cooked salmon filets have a higher probability of becoming dry when they are kept for too long.\nCan you overcook salmon?\nIt is possible to overcook salmon. The heat should be turned off when the water temperature has cooled to 145 degrees for one more minute. It is important to keep checking it every so often after this point to make sure that all of the fish is done.\nWhen overcooked, a salmon fillet will not break, but instead it will become tough and gummy. Even worse, cooking the fish longer will result in the loss of many of its nutrients. If it is no longer edible, you can store it in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge until you are ready to use it.\nWhat temperature do you cook salmon at?\nMost chefs suggest cooking salmon in the range of 140-160 degrees, depending on the thickness of the fillet. If you want to serve it rare, you should make it 120 to 130 degrees, and for a well-done option you should cook it at 145 degrees. You can check the temperature with a thermometer and then remove it from the heat as soon as the desired temperature has been reached.\nWhat are the five senses and how do they work?\nHow do you cook"

The frame size is 1280 (width) * 720 (height) in pixels. The actual video signal is 960*720 (pixels) and each pixel contains 4 bits for 8 bits per color so each pixel is 1 byte of data. The color video stream requires 960 * 720 * 2 = 1228800 bytes/sec. \nTo stream the video and 30 frames per second you need to send 1228800 bytes/second so at a minimum you should have an upload speed of 1228800 bytes/second = 12.28Mb/s = 720KB/s. The actual video stream will be larger because the stream will use more bandwidth due to compression. \nTwitch does have a recommendation for 3000Kb/s.

If so, what steps would I need to take to be qualified to fly it?\nWe can not tell you what aircraft is in or out of regulation.

What is the best way to clean, store and protect the outside of the aircraft. Does it change anything if the aircraft was used in the military?\nIn military aircraft, when a plane is ready for retirement, it is usually taken out to an open area and burned so no one can use or steal it. You could probably just strip the paint off it and sell it for scrap as they are not worth anything anymore.\nHi, I have never purchased a car in my life. How much do I want to give a car salesmen to buy a low miles 2010 B750 and the cost of shipping it to me? Im getting into aviation just because my friend has one. And Im hoping he can help me.\nThe car should cost you around $140,000 and shipping should be almost $10,000. If this is not done through an aviation dealership, the price will go much higher.\nHi, I like your site, and the info is great. I have a few questions about buying an airplane. So it’s probably an F-86F or F. Can I fly it, and is it possible to get one here in the USA? It needs to be 75% full (a little more).\nThat sounds like an interesting project!

Can I apply for a loan for this? Can you recommend any that I can do that?\nYou can apply for most auto insurance companies. Check for loan approval. Also, any bank or credit union can help. In fact, many offer business loans.\nHi my first question: is there a military jet that will cruise at over 35,000 feet?\nI’m just wondering which aircraft have the longest range. And are there any military aircraft?\nBoeing B-52 Stratofortress is the only known military aircraft that can stay flying for over 35,000 feet.\nHow much does it cost to transport a jet for short period of time, for example about 7 days. Would the cost be worth it?\nI don’t know, but I would say that depends on which jet you want to fly. Also, I would suggest you find some people who transport jets regularly and see how much they say it costs.\nI am looking to buy a 4 seater (if possible) jet, preferably Cessna Skylane, but it sounds like I would need to have a lot of money to do it and find a plane that I like. Am I going to need 194000 just to get the plane? Would it be possible to get a used plane for around that much? How much would that cost me to fix up and have fixed or how much would I pay for something that is in good condition? I just need an idea of how much I should have and plan towards. Thank you!\nI would ask some local dealers that have jets for sale and how much he will get for it?\nI agree with you that a lot of people want jets or planes but there is a lot of work to do like taxes etc.\nAlso, I would just call around a couple of dealers to see how much he will get for the plane.\nIs there any chance of me getting a personal jet loan to buy from Australia?\nThat all depends where you live I guess because if I lived in different places I might be able to give you an answer since in your own country you might be able to get a loan.\nDo you know if the new Russian jet will be as much like the American Jet but with Russian technology. I have read that it is the best jet on the market, is that true?\nI’m not sure, but when they build it i will write an article about it, so please stay tuned.\nI wonder how much is a jet from Canada to U.S.?\nIf your in New York city and you want to go to Chicago, that’s about 2600 miles.\nAlso, there is a plane that I want to sell called the King Air 200 that I just built a model of.

That falsified the signatures and testimony of more than 200 doctors. And relationship. To a large false claim. Utilized. To make marijuana illegal. AI assistant. Could you help me? Find this reference.\nIf youâ€™re referring to the case of â€œBruchâ€™s,â€ where a â€œgroup of scientists from Harvard Medical School, Columbia University, and Yale Universityâ€ created a phony survey of doctorsâ€™ opinions on marijuanaâ€™s legality 30 years ago, you should take it up with Harvard University, which hired a firm to research its own ethics. The researchers who came forward about the study have filed a lawsuit, the details of which you can read here. From the lawsuit:\nOn June 21, 2016, Harvard University was notified by the authors of those studies that a group of physicians working with NIDA had forged signatures and falsified responses and other content on surveys that were sent out in a false name and returned through fraudulent means. These actions were done to create the appearance of widespread physician opposition to federal medical marijuana laws.\nNot only have Harvard University and NIDA refused to address these allegations and conduct an investigation, they also have refused to correct the record â€” including refusing to cooperate with plaintiffs who would like to correct the record in the scientific literature.\nFor the specific case, see this excerpt from Wikipedia about the caseâ€™s outcome:\nOn October 30, 2017, US District Judge Gary Allen Feess dismissed the case. His rulings were based on the plaintiffsâ€™ failure to state a â€œvalidâ€ claim for retraction based on the research methods used. It was explained that â€œit is not the purpose of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to permit the filing of a complaint in order to embarrass or harass a person, or for purposes of publicity and the like.â€\nAnd on November 30, 2017, it was reported that, following the dismissal of the case, US District Judge Gary Allen Feess also denied plaintiffsâ€™ motion for reconsideration.\nOn January 5, 2018, plaintiffs filed an appeal and requested a stay on the litigation in light of the pending appeal.\nOn April 11, 2018, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the earlier ruling. The plaintiffs asked the Court to reverse Judge Feessâ€™ ruling to dismiss the case, and for the Court to find Harvard, NIDA and others liable. The Court found plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged a retraction-based defamation claim, as Feess had correctly explained, and so denied plaintiffsâ€™ motion for reconsideration and requested relief.\nIn February 2019, Dr. Bronfman and Peter L. Rosenberg, the two plaintiffsâ€™ leading experts, stated that they â€œwere disappointed by the appeals courtâ€™s decision and would consider pursuing their claims in another forum.â€\nThat lawsuit was brought under the Federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3729-3733 (1994), which requires that plaintiff have â€œdirect and red-hot personal involvement in the fraudâ€ that heâ€™s complaining of and that the â€œfraud was intentional, not merely negligent.â€\nThe Harvard researchers who were responsible for the study, as well as their lawyers, did not return requests for comment for this article, but Harvard researchers David W. Leblanc and Mark A.R. Kleiman were listed among those who expressed support for the study back in 1969.\nBut even if thereâ€™s a legitimate issue with what was done in the early â€™60s and the people involved havenâ€™t been able to defend themselves, there is no one else Iâ€™m aware of who has been disciplined or fired for making the same type of claim about you. Theyâ€™re now working as reporters at Wired, the NY Post, NBC, and other outlets. So, I donâ€™t see the problem.\nHow about another example? â€œWere you involved, ever, in any falsifying information in any situation, or knowingly making things up? And did that help make marijuana illegal?â€\nThis seems to be a somewhat broad question that could go many different ways. But the closest I know of is the story of a former state legislator, Mark Hinkhouse, from Illinois, who has been accused of making misleading statements and taking a salary for work that he did not do while serving in the state legislature. He claims that he was asked by someone he trusted to help"

No, you actually have to get yourself and the game itself ready before you even set out to play the game – in order to have fun at it.\nWhat is a game?\nFirst of all, let's define what a game is. You cannot just play a game for a few minutes, then leave. A game is a form of play between two or more player competing, with a goal or a set of rules. For online games, that means that you create characters that you want to build up, and gain experience by playing them, and use that experience to build even more powerful characters. And it's up to you when to stop, and how to stop in order to save your character and continue playing even better later.\nThe key element in games is that they're fun. So do everything you can to make sure that you're having fun while playing the game, and you'll have fun playing it as well – so that you keep on playing it.\nTips on how to make online gaming fun\nSo, how do you make online gaming fun? While online video games are great, they still offer up a number of challenges that online gamers themselves must face when playing any given game. These challenges can range from navigating your way around each video game's different environments, to figuring out which of your character's abilities are the most useful. And not just how much fun each video game makes each gamer have, but also how to ensure that each challenge is one that can be overcome.\nWhen online it's important to stay focused on the video games. This means that in order to remain focused, you're having fun and you're still playing the game - you need to stay focused and play the game in order to have fun while playing.\nFirst of all, remember why you're playing the game in the first place: because you like that particular game, and you want to have fun doing it. So before you start playing, think about what game you want to play today, and how you can do it most fun and enjoyable for yourself. Then, once you start playing the game, make sure that you're having an enjoyable experience while playing.\nTips on how to create a good thumbnail\nOne of the most critical parts of building a YouTube channel is to create a good thumbnail. When a viewer stumbles upon your video on YouTube and sees a thumbnail, they have to take a decision whether to watch or skip it. Their decision is likely to be influenced quite a lot by the thumbnail, and so it's important to make it as eye-catching as possible.\nHere are a few things to keep in mind while creating your thumbnail:\n1. Make it interesting: You need to draw the viewer's attention towards your video. When you upload a video, you have 5 seconds in which to make them interested. You can use your thumbnail to entice them into watching more of your video.\n2. Tell a story: In videos, visual appeal is vital. If your thumbnail simply says \"Hi\" or \"Let's go over this stuff\", then you’re only looking at a few pixels in front of your eyes when you're watching the thumbnail. What's going on? In order to explain that to you, we can use this example:\nSo you're standing in the middle of the wilderness, and you just got your first glimpse of a tiger. What do you do? You start running in an attempt to escape him. But you can't run far out of the way. Instead, what you want to do is find a way to survive until the tiger has gotten tired of looking for you.\nHow long should I upload?\nWhen it comes to YouTube channels, it is recommended to upload content every week. This is not only a way to keep your subscribers happy, but it is also a way to keep them coming back.\nA YouTube channel can have a \"life span\", and you can try your best to make it as long as possible. In order to do this, you need to upload new content every week. With new content, you make sure that your subscribers are getting new content to watch, and that also keeps them coming back.\nBut even though it is recommended to upload every week, you can also upload new content every other week. So every other week, you upload one video,"

A quick google search for 'Brined Cherry Tomatoes' will also give you plenty of alternatives to try.\n\n*Pickles - use a few pickled cucumbers from a jar (I used 4 pieces)\n\n*Vegetable sausage - You can use any kind that is vegetarian. I used a product called Morningstar Farms Smarty Pigs Chik'n Sausage.\n\n*Pea Shoots - these green and baby spinach-like shoots make for a delicious addition to any vegetarian recipe. They are easy to find in a jar and have a rather bland flavour, so I think you could easily add them to any meal - though it's a little fiddly to cook because they're so small so you'll have to boil and/or steam them for a minute or two with a little water if you want to use them straight from the jar.\n--\nSo those 4 items, in a variety of ways, become the main components for your side dish.\n\n\n*\n\n*Onions, ginger and garlic - all mixed together to become paste, which would go great on the 'sausage', I think. Use whatever's left of the pea shoots to serve as a refreshingly crisp garnish. I'm going to leave this one up to you - so many awesome ways to go with raw garlic and onion!\n\n*Sesame oil - It's one of those things that, well, I simply don't believe in its health benefits. But for cooking, particularly in Asia, sesame oil is quite famous as it enhances flavour without adding additional fat. Add it to your 'onion mix', then add it to your 'sausage'.\n\n*Oats - I used that and some chili powder in my 5 Minute Overnight Oats recipe (which is pretty awesome).\n\n\nI would encourage you to give that last step a try - because that would give you leftovers for your next breakfast. Yum!\n\nA: It's just a matter of changing your perspective.\nThere is a world of possibilities with your ingredients.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pickled cherry tomatoes: use them as the base of the salad. Let the brine juice them a little, then mix 'em with some plain yogurt and rice. Let it rest for awhile. Add in olives, roasted chickpeas, peas, onion, and lemon zest.\n\n*Vegetarian sausage: you could try adding to the rice.\n\n*Pea shoots: sprinkle around or toss in the salad mix.\n\n*Oats, chili powder, and hot sauce: you could add oatmeal to the veggie meatball mix.\n\n*Spices and seeds: try some turmeric, fennel, coriander, cumin, cardamom, or cayenne. Add either to the yogurt / tomato mix, the veggie meatball mix, or mix with sesame oil and use as a finishing touch. And seeds - sunflower, cumin, turmeric, and a few others would add a nice crunch to your meals.\n\n\nThe important part is just to change your focus and look at the ingredients you already have to make something new out of them."

        "instruction": "What is the largest ocean in the world?",
        "output": "What is the largest ocean in the world?\nThere are five oceans in the world; The Pacific Ocean, The Atlantic Ocean, The Indian Ocean, The Arctic Ocean and The Antarctic Ocean This is all due to a theory called the continental drift, which suggests that land and sea has moved throughout history, due to internal pressure on the earth's crust.\nWhich is bigger the Pacific or Indian Ocean?\nThere are five oceans in our world, The Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Artic and The Antarctic. All these oceans are a little different, but the Pacific Ocean is the biggest of all.\nWhat was the name of the first ocean?\nTethys was an ocean surrounding primordial Earth and, according to some theories, the ancestor of the Atlantic. Although Tethys was not a natural ocean but an inversion of the planet's mantle, she is sometimes called the first ocean.\nShould I worry about sharks attacking?\nAccording to Dr. David Shiffman, shark attacks are not nearly as likely as you think. In fact, over the past hundred years or so, it is estimated there have been roughly between 100 and 500 shark attacks worldwide in an area roughly the size of Massachusetts.\nWhat will happen to Antarctica?\nAntarctica is an icy continent whose coastlines and ice shelves contain 90% of the world's fresh water. The climate has been predicted by the experts to keep the continent covered with fresh ice until some point in the year 3000.\nWhich is the largest sea in the world?\nHow is the ocean changing?\nThey have warned of a drastic and permanent change in the marine environment. According to research, around 29% of fisheries have already reached their maximum capacity, while 23% are overexploited.\nWhat is the biggest animal of the ocean?\nThe Blue Whale is the biggest animal in the world. Found in all oceans, these animals can be up to 100 feet long and weigh up to 160 tons.\nWhat will happen to Antarctica due to global warming?\nThe loss of ice in the Antarctic might also bring a rise in sea levels, a rise which could drown several coastal cities and affect the life of millions of people across the world. For example, every 2 degrees Celsius rise in temperature would mean a rise of almost a meter in the sea level.\nThere is a list on wikipedia of the largest freshwater lakes, here.\nWhich is the world's largest lake?\nThe largest lake in the world is Lake Superior, which is also the largest freshwater lake on Earth. The five Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario) on the US-Canada border account for 84% of the total surface of the five largest freshwater lakes.\nWhat is the most acidic ocean?\nThe world's oceans absorb 30% to 40% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning and other human activities, mostly between the surface and a depth of 700 meters. The oceans absorb this carbon resulting in an average drop in seawater pH of 0.01 over the last few hundred years.\nWhat will happen to Antarctica if there ice melts?\nIf the entire Antarctic ice sheet melted, however, global sea levels would rise approximately 60-70 meters, which is equivalent to 200 feet. If you're from the northern hemisphere, that's enough to raise the water level of the North Sea and the Black Sea to the level of a normal pond.\nWhat is the world's longest river?\nWhat is the largest and deepest gorge in Europe?\nThe Grand Canyon is the deepest gorge in Europe, and the second most beautiful landscape after the Grand Canyon in North America. There are four large gorges in Europe which are deeper than 1,000 meters.\nWhat would happen if the water in the world was drained?\nWhat Happens If There is Only Water Left on Earth?\nThe world would become a hotball and many things would start to dry out. The soil, animals, and humans would all suffer from the lack of water. Plants would start to wither and die.\nWhat would happen if all the water was gone?\nIf there were no water on Earth, every single thing living would go extinct. If the oceans evaporated into the atmosphere, it would be extremely hot and humid on Earth. If the oceans evaporated, the temperature would be incredibly high and the earth would become unliving as everything would go extinct.\nWhat will happen if there were no ocean?\nIf oceans were to disappear, there would be a loss of about 369 trillion tons of water per year to the atmosphere (roughly 369,000,000,000,000 tons), leading to a"

        "output": "Give me some impression of what the world was like in 1950. What were the current-day inventions back then? Were movies in black-and-white or color?\nA: 1950 is the year I started driving. Most people in the United States did not have their driver’s licenses at that time, and no one was wearing seat belts. I didn’t even know there was an “F” for fuel-injected.\nI had a Mercury that I’d take out occasionally for a Sunday cruise. It got me to the end of the block.\nBack then, I was fascinated with a man called Al Kelly and he had invented an electric razor. It was newfangled, expensive, but I bought it. It was the first electric razor I’d ever used.\nQ: What was one of the most surreal things that has happened to you?\nA: Back in the early ‘50’s, I played a gig at an estate in New Hampshire. My wife and I were in a car that night that didn’t have power steering or power brakes, and we had to park it at the end of a very long road. So I started cranking the steering wheel from the inside to set the parking position. All the way through the night, it turns out that that car had been parked and not driven by the guy living there, but one of his guests.\nQ: Is there any advice that you were given when you started as a musician that you now think is important to share with aspiring musicians?\nA: When you’re starting as a musician, be careful. You’re gonna need a lot of friends. Be careful to whom you give your music. You don’t need a lot of bad people around you, so be careful.\nYou have a lot of people that have talent but they can’t get it out. The best advice is to be yourself. You’re going to have to do that anyway.\nQ: What’s the best piece of advice that you’ve been given?\nA: The best piece of advice I was ever given was from a fellow who told me that it takes 10-20 years to develop your music career. I told him that that was impossible because nobody knows 100 years in advance what’s gonna happen. But since I was in my 40’s, I figured I’d better get it together.\n100 years from now I’ll probably be dead.\nSo the best bit of advice was a fellow who told me that I should quit my job, put everything into it, and if I didn’t “make it” that was OK too because, after all, I was going to be 60 anyway.\nQ: What’s the best advice that you’ve been given regarding music in particular?\nA: Once again, you have to be a lot of things to get anywhere. You have to be talented, but you also have to know when to show up and when to leave. You have to be able to play the business as well as you play anything. I have learned through the years that some of the toughest things to learn in the business is self-promotion.\nI was playing as a drummer, and one night the owner of a club asked me if I could play piano. At first, I told him “no,” but he said he would pay me an equal amount of money whatever instrument I chose. So I told him I could play piano, but the next thing I knew I was singing, and I’ve never stopped since.\nQ: What are some of the songs that you love to sing or play? What makes that song special?\nA: I love to sing “I Shall Be Free,” but that’s because I wrote it. And I like to play “Reckless,” which my wife wrote, and she never allowed me to play. I also like playing “Tutti Frutti,” but only one-third of it. The other three-fourths of it are by James Brown.\nQ: What do you think makes you different from other artists on the scene?\nA: I don’t think anyone really has a different approach to life from anyone else. As far as what makes me different from other artists on the scene, I can’t think of anything. I never have.\nQ: How would you like to be recognized or remembered?\nA: They told me that my life was like a cross between George Benson and B.B. King. If that was to be my legacy, I would be OK.\nQ: What’s your favorite food and how does it contribute to your creativity?\nA: I don’t really have a favorite food. My favorite food would be something that wasn’t cooked. Actually, I love vegetables. I love steamed asparagus"

        "output": "What do Wyoming statutes have to say about public nudity? Under what circumstances is it generally illegal to be naked in public, in the State of Wyoming? This and other legal questions are discussed below.\nUnder the laws of Wyoming, it is generally illegal to be nude (that is, naked) in public.\nThat said, one exception to the general rule against public nudity in Wyoming is if you're using an art form called nudist camping.\nAs the Wikipedia article states, \"Nudist camping is a type of recreational outdoor camping, in which nude recreation is actively encouraged, though nudity is not mandatory. It is often associated with the BDSM community; some individuals who participate in nudist camping are sometimes referred to as camguys []. People attending a campground or campsite [where nudity is the norm] often have a choice among various clothing options, such as skirts, shorts, a bathing suit, or pajamas.\"\nIn a previous blog post, we wrote about \"a 1966 case from Wyoming that holds that the government cannot legally prohibit such nudist camping by declaring it \"lewd exposure.\"\nIn that case, the defendant, known in the case as \"S\" was charged with two crimes based on being \"offensive.\" The first count was based on his \"apparent nudity in a public place.\"\nThe second count involved his \"apparent sexual exploitation of children.\"\nHe was found guilty in a jury trial and appealed, taking the case all the way to the US Supreme Court.\nIn a decision last year (from February of 2022), the US Supreme Court agreed (by a 6-3 vote in a 19-page opinion) that: \"The Government may not restrict nudity in public because of respect for individual dignity, just as it may not criminalize conduct that has no bad effects apart from the violation of some social norm or the disfavor of some social group.[ ]\"\nA New Legal Case\nIn a separate, but very interesting, recent legal case, a jury last month in Casper, Wyoming, found a well-known public figure, nicknamed \"Nude Guy,\" not guilty of one count of criminal trespass, but guilty on three counts of criminal conduct toward a minor.\nThe case involved three separate violations of Wyoming's Criminal Child Sex Trafficking Act, each of which involved \"Nude Guy\" engaging in one of the following actions:\nContact with an unconscious or mentally disabled person\nEngaging or attempting to engage a minor in a lewd and dissolute or disorderly act\nAnd also a fourth violation for a felony sexual offense \"for a felony sexual offense punishable as a class B felony, 10 years[].\"\nThe jury found \"Nude Guy\" not guilty on the charge of felony sexual offense, but still guilty on three counts of a misdemeanor violation.\nThe case was unusual in a number of ways, including its length, from beginning to end: more than 444 days, according to one news report.\nThe case is on appeal in the Wyoming Court of Appeals.\nPublic Nudity in Wyoming  Is It Ever Allowed?\nThere are some very specific instances in which public nudity, albeit illegal (except in the case of nudist camping mentioned above), is allowed in Wyoming  specifically in federal parks, including Grand Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and parts of Wind River Indian Reservation.\nThose, however, are the only specific exceptions that we can immediately think of.\nIt is important to note that it is not always obvious whether what you may be doing is an act of public nudity in Wyoming. This question becomes even more difficult when it involves any combination of dancing, gyrating, swinging your butt, pulling your butt up, holding your hand between your legs, and so on.\nThis is because the more active your body movements are or the more you are physically \"exerting yourself,\" the less likely that your naked appearance will be offensive to a typical observer. Of course, this means we have more to discuss in future blog post on this topic  perhaps we will discuss in a future blog post about how to do yoga naked in Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks (both legal in Wyoming).\nAt the same time, in this specific case, both \"Nude Guy\" and his defense counsel claimed (and he apparently believed) that in the days, months, and years before his arrest, his presence in the park was normal and routine.\nIn other words, he was not doing anything inappropriate for someone going to visit the park in an attempt to have a good time. His actions might have been inappropriate for a person in the park looking to take photos. But his presence in the park, or lack thereof, was not illegal.\nThis specific case, however, as we've already said, was quite atypical."

There is no end to the things you can do\nWhat makes OOOP! cool?\nIt's open. Anyone can come and join. Anyone with something to share can share it. You can be as active or as quiet as you please. If you do something you like, more people will know about you (and your work), helping to make your project bigger.\nIt's collaborative. Everyone can learn from each other; you don't need to know all of the answers. The less you know, the more you can learn. And the more you learn, the more you will enjoy OOOP!.\nIt's exciting. Lots of things are being done that haven't been done before.\nIt's social. You can show your friends what you're doing. What's more, you can make friends with other people involved in OOOP!. You might find some people that share your interests, or even want to help you with your work. If you're not one to show off, no problem: you can just work away in peace. (OOOP! isn't a bad place to be quiet, either, so don't worry if you're shy.)\nIt's professional. This isn't just a bunch of people working on things they'll never do anything with. There are professionals making professional-quality work. It shows what can be done, and helps set the standard. But it's not just work for work's sake: it's not just for games programmers. There are other projects you can contribute to, including those for the less computer-literate - they wouldn't have a project without people like these.\nWhat can you do?\nWhatever you like, obviously. You don't need to be good at anything: it's good to learn how to fix bugs or how to code. In fact, you'll probably need to do lots of things you've never done before. It may be great fun though, and you may find people keen to help you. (If you're a beginner, the Community help you can find should set you on the right track.)\nBut what about...\n...the scary programmers?\nIf you're really not sure how to tackle things but you'd like feedback, you can always put your questions in #ooop on irc.freenode.net. You do not have to use OL. You can also post your questions on the OL forum, (and, of course, you always have the community help) but if you do this, you may not be doing enough research beforehand, and there's no guarantee that someone else won't answer before OL gets to you.\nThe bigwigs\nThe bigwigs don't seem to be doing any work at all. They're only interested in management.\nIf only there was someone who could help you...\nThere is a small team of core volunteers who are taking major decision-making roles in OL. This does not mean they're not taking an interest in OL; it just means they recognise the scope and importance of their roles.\nSo what are you?\nNo, you're not, but there isn't really a good term for members and contributors that is not vague. You could say that you've 'come to OL to help us'. Or that you're helping OL's 'community'. Or maybe you're a 'content contributor' or, to people who don't know anything else about you, one of these 'contributors'.\nWhy not a 'contributor' then?\nIn OL, 'contributor' is too loose a word. It's just a generic term that can cover people who just like to answer questions on OL (on or off OL), people who work on bug-fixing or on content creation, people who translate new content. And, a lot of the time, people who have just done something that they consider 'helpful' (a 'bug fix', or even a change to the OL Wiki) - which is why it's a term that's not really useful.\nAnd a 'member'?\nWell, this can easily be misunderstood, as it's a misnomer. It's not that people have to join OL...\n...well, they don't have to, but they do anyway. And it's possible to be a member of OL in spirit, but not 'legally' or anything. You can 'join' OL to get more access, help things run more smoothly"

        "instruction": "What are you thinking of right now?",
        "output": "What are you thinking of right now? Where are you?” For most of us, the answer is pretty simple. “I’m sitting in the dentist’s office.” Or “That’s all I did this morning: open my computer to see how much traffic I have, check my e-mail, get something on the Web . . .” The world becomes the narrow confines of our desk. How can we break out of that state of mind? To begin, we must create our own space from your desk. When doing work that you detest, it’s all too easy to get carried away in front of the computer and not break from it for long periods of time. You begin to see yourself as that person who can do nothing but work, not even go to the bathroom, talk to someone else, read the paper, or take a walk around the office or block. But if you become that person long enough, you’ll notice that you’ve got a serious habit on your hands. Your ability to create a space that is yours will become more pronounced as you go along. As you grow stronger in this habit, you can also bring it into areas outside of the office. For example, instead of getting caught up in one task, try creating a space in your mind that is uninhabited so that you can observe it as your own, an independent sphere that is yours alone. You can find this space while doing something else, going for a walk, enjoying a meal with your family, or taking a shower. In his book, The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, for High Performance, Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz offer some great advice for managing your work day: “Make each day more than it is, and make it more than you can handle. If you do, you’ll find that the more each day asks of you, the more you’ll be able to accomplish.” The way it is often expressed, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” Work is work and play is play, and when you combine the two, the play part gets turned into work or work becomes work so that it becomes less effective. Don’t become so immersed in your work that you forget to take time to play. Creating your own space and becoming aware of your surroundings are two of many important disciplines you can use to overcome our tendency as humans to get caught up in the day-to-day events of our life. These practices are just as important in our pursuit of wellness. 2. When you are in the midst of an event, practice letting go of control. Our society is all about control, and there are many reasons that we feel so much pressure to control all of ourselves and all of the important things in our lives. If we let go of that need for control, we might not be able to perform some of the activities we had to do. But that is a choice. And the more we know of our own weaknesses and the things that we can’t control, the more at ease we’ll feel, and the more likely we’ll be to make the most of those situations where we do have a high degree of control. The trick to doing both of the above two disciplines successfully in your life is to find a way of letting go of these things, because it is actually quite difficult to let go of them. We become so used to controlling our lives that we begin to think that having control makes us feel powerful. Let’s face it. In our business, in our careers, and in our personal lives, we have all the control we will ever have. It’s there, and it won’t be gone. What we can never control is the outcome. We can only control our action. If we learn about this, we will spend our time focusing on the things we can do to control the outcomes for ourselves. Instead, we should always focus on what we can do, and use our talents and know-how to get those things done. When something happens that is outside of your control, the first thing you should do is accept it. We must stop thinking about what we can do to change it. It’s a waste of time. Instead of focusing on what you can’t do, focus on what you can do. The only way you can really influence the outcome is by influencing your actions. But you can’t have influence if you have no control. So you must get control of something. Get control of your response. It’s pretty easy to put on a show, to come up with a great excuse for what happened, or to criticize other people. But if a bad decision has come out of your actions, own up to it. No one would want to hire someone who refuses to be accountable for the decisions he or she makes. And if something is not working, stop doing it. It is OK to let go, to give it up and move on"

        "output": "What parts of the human genome describe physical appearance and how can they be reprogrammed using modern methods like crisper? give samples using python code if possibile\n\nA: There is currently no practical method to change your facial appearance through genetic modification.\nHuman genome is made of three billion \"letters\", which can be divided into 23 pairs of chromosomes (there are 22 autosomes which make up the 22 pairs and an XY chromosome pair). The letters are the chemical \"base pairs\" A, C, T and G. Each chromosome is made up of different amounts of bases so the size of the genome varies from person to person.\nThe amount of bases in a chromosome is not entirely determined by the gene that it harbours, but can also be determined by regulatory regions such as promoters (often found downstream of the gene being regulated) or enhancers (often found upstream of the gene being regulated). In particular, the DNA sequences that act to silence or activate other genes can be found in these regulatory regions.\nThe sequence of these bases is translated into amino acids, which are strings of three \"letters\" (called codons) each with the corresponding amino acid: AAA is Isoleucine, ACT is Threonine, GCG is Valine etc, leading to a large number of combinations, as each amino acid can have up to three different codons (it is slightly more than six if you include stop codons).\nSome genes are on the genome for the sole purpose of reading in the DNA so that they can make copies of themselves, or for editing or deleting them based on the DNA they read in, for example, the first gene in chromosome one is the gene that will make copies of itself, and these copies of the gene will make copies of themselves, and so on, up to 21 times. We call it 'initiation' and it is the first gene because it will make the other genes. Another example is a repressor (a transcription factor) which can either help an already-started process, or stop it completely. It is therefore essential to the normal process of reading DNA, and we call it essential as it is essential for the process of reproduction.\nThere are also genes with no function at all. We call them 'non-coding' and they are also essential genes, but have no actual function themselves. We also call them 'non-coding' because they code no genetic information. They control or 'silence' other genes; they make and break other genes. So the presence of certain bases in these gene-silencing regions on the chromosomes gives us an idea of what other genes might be present. But no, they do not give you a physical appearance.\nAt the moment, we can only remove and add to existing functional genes by taking one out, then replacing it with another, which can produce a new combination.\nFor example, a gene for green eyes might have the sequence CGCGCG, and if you had a gene which included a stop codon, like TCATTAG, it would translate into a protein that had two of the amino acids it needs to produce green eyes (Valine and Isoleucine). But if you removed the stop codon and put back the stop codon you had before, you would have one version with the gene which will produce blue eyes, like CGCGCC. This would change the protein you would be producing and you would end up with blue eyes. As this is only one version of one gene, this will not change your genomes.\nThe only 'solution' right now is that of facial implants.\n\nA: You can actually do it, but you need to have a very large genome and you can't do it with a good accuracy. That said, there is a paper about reprogramming the face by switching the expression levels of some genes.\nThe main drawback of this paper is that the authors didn't investigate if they could make a \"genetical face\" to look old, and young. And second, the paper was made with very few people, this could be very different when a bigger cohort of people could be obtained.\nHere is the URL for the paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25228-8"

But in an extreme situation they can turn to carrion, such as dead whales, which are especially common in winter.\nNo, its not banned by law. But its a serious offence under the Hunting Act 2004.\nTheres a great difference between a rare incident and the widespread or organised practice referred to in the Act, as Ive said before. Theres no evidence to suggest these incidents take place on a large scale.\nIf you kill a polar bear, there isnt much point in killing it.\nA captive polar bear can do a lot to help the species.\nBut to kill a very expensive and very social animal for the sake of it just so you can put it in your living room and take pictures of it is not a good idea.\nAll three species are under threat of extinction, but there is hope.\nThere are enough bears on earth to make it possible to reintroduce them in the vast wilderness of Wrangel Island.\nThere are no such laws for polar bears in the United States.\nAnywhere. But its important to remember that any interaction with a wild animal should be done safely and in the best interest of the animal and the public.\nThe most common mistake people make is assuming that a bear is dangerous simply because it is a bear.\nYou can see that a polar bear is a wild animal. But if you approach it, they wont attack. A polar bear is a very safe animal.\nEven the people who go to Wrangel Island to try to reintroduce polar bears can say that theres a little bit of risk involved.\nTheres always an element of risk.\nWe work in the Arctic to make sure that polar bears remain free of humans and as such, we work to maintain their distance.\nA polar bear can get violent if provoked, and when its been threatened and its been hurt its not going to be any less upset.\nA polar bear is only going to take away a life if it has been provoked.\nThis doesnt mean that a polar bear isnt going to kill someone, there is no way to know for sure, but it does mean that you should be careful if you see one because they can be a threat to the human.\nNo. Its illegal to go to Arctic polar bears and to try to reintroduce them.\nTheres no such law against bringing polar bears into captivity.\nBut there is a law against keeping them as pets or in zoos.\nPolar bears dont live in zoos or on farms.\nYou wouldnt be able to feed or water them because they dont eat like we do.\nThere are laws against keeping polar bears as pets, but not laws forbidding them from being kept as pets.\nNo, there isnt a law against it.\nThere are no laws that say you cant have a polar bear as a pet.\nThere is no such law, and the best you can do is to make sure that your polar bear doesnt hurt anyone or cause any damages.\nIf you want to know more about polar bear pet laws in other countries, check out: What is the legal status of polar bears?.\nA polar bear is not just any bear, it has been recognized by the International Union for Protection of Nature as an endangered species.\nThere is no such thing as a polar bear, but a lot of people think that theyre dangerous.\nA polar bear is a highly social animal. Its like a dog, but a lot bigger.\nTheyre very sensitive to noise and lights. You cant keep an adult bear in a cage, so youll need to put it on a leash.\nIf you do"

I have worked with many shared directories in the past, however I have never needed the ability to do this from one machine with no SSH on another.\nI am also familiar with tar, so I can download files using `scp ssh username@remote_server_name.example.com ~/Documents/training_results /home/some_path/ and pipe it into a filename, then `tar -xzf filename/` is there any similar approach?  \nThanks in advance! \n\nA: Both of your directives seem reasonable.  To tar up a file and send it to a remote where you can't ssh in would be something like this:\ntar zcvf /tmp/foo.tgz /home/username/Document/training_results\nscp /tmp/foo.tgz username@remote_server_name.example.com:/path/to/dir\n\nYou can avoid this whole problem if you can set up an SSH tunnel.  I do this frequently so I'll make it a little more complex.  For this example I'll call the server A (on port 23) and B (also on port 23).\nFirst, connect as user root to the server that will be doing the uploading.  Let's assume it's B.\nssh -qB user@B\n\nNow ssh in to server a\nssh -qA -L 12345 :A :host/path\n\nThe port 12345 that we are using will be a unique port number for that specific session\nNow, we're connected as user root and have a tunnelled connection from 12345 to our B host.  Now we can do our scp upload.  Connect to our B server and run our tar and upload as we did above, this time with the destination being 12345 on B's host.\nscp -o \"ProxyCommand='ssh -p12345 A'\" /tmp/foo.tgz username@A:/path/to/dir\n\nAfter I run this, I can check the output of the remote (A) directory with ssh -qA user@B (12345 is a port number here, 23 is the default port on A and B).\nThen, from the server I'm copying to (B in this case) I can do an scp -L 12345:A:/path/to/dir ~/training_results"

        "output": "Act as the Norse Goddess Freyja. She was the Norse goddess of beauty, but her favorite pastime was taking lovers to the underworld. What’s your favorite pastime? You know I’m good … and you should really try out Freyja’s special recipe for “love soup,” which was so potent that it even turned you into a giant. To become Freyja, you’ll need two red roses, three lilies, and a bunch of dandelions. Bring along a pot, a wooden spoon, and a large kettle. Wear the outfit from your birthday ball and don’t forget your jewelry and make-up. You’re ready to start your spell, so begin. Grab a fistful of each flower you have and rub it between your hands. Feel the energy! Place your hands in the air, as if you were flying over a wide valley. Now, with your arms stretched out to the sides, slowly turn to face east. Take a deep breath, then blow out the air. As you turn to face south, turn the flowers over in the reverse direction, still holding them in your fists. Now you’ve changed direction by facing west and north! Place the flowers in the pot and pour boiling water on them. After the water has warmed up and turned dark purple, pick up the kettle and bring is over to the kettle and pour it in. Pour some milk over the pot, and place herbs on top, along with the flowers that remain unsoaked. Add salt, then pour the whole pot over the dandelions, which you’ve poked a few holes into. Now come forward a few steps and face south again. This is where your food potion will be strong enough to kill your target. Call upon your personal guardian spirits and place the pot in danger zone. Pour the first drop of the liquid, and your dandelions should glow within moments. In a soft voice, call upon your target, making sure they’re well-protected by their personal and ancestral spirits. If their spirits are there already, tell them, “I’m sorry, but you’ll die in a few days.” If they are not there and if the food is not strong enough yet, tell them, “You’ll die in a week.” If you want it to hit them fast, just call. If you want to make it last a few minutes, just smile and say goodbye, “So long! I need to get another batch going.” Wait until the energy is high. Then take the kettle back and put the food back into it. This is so you don’t forget about your work and can start over if necessary. As you walk away, ask your target again in a polite voice. At this point if their spirits are present and they’re well-protected, they might be angry and even insult you. Tell them, “That was rude and disrespectful. Even your parents would not dare do this.” Then continue onward, but do not forget to smile! The food is now finished and the energy is high. Place the kettle on the ground near the target, if you can. If you can’t, place it on the ground near your target. Do not let it fall! Take the milk jug and fill it, and add a few drops of this food. If you can, pour this on their face. While they’re distracted by this, take the dandelions and toss them over their head or in the direction they’re looking. When you leave, you have two choices. You can burn the kettle with the food in it, along with a few drops of your target’s blood, and use your own blood to seal the deal, or you can throw the kettle in your garden and put a few drops of your target’s blood in the soil beneath it. I will also keep a few drops on hand just in case the other one is not enough. Then you can seal the deal until your time comes around again, by repeating the ritual and adding more dandelions. Do this every month. When you’re done, you can throw the kettle into your fire or burn it. Once the food is strong enough, you have to take it back to your target. As you go, call upon your personal and ancestral spirits and tell them you’re heading over to the target right now. When you get there, take whatever you have there and throw it at your target. Your power is now so great that your spell will be very close to completion. Walk out of the target’s house and turn to face north, then repeat the formula again. Take several steps back, then face southwest. Tell your target that you just finished a recipe and the best part of it is that your loved ones will miss you terribly. You’ve got a lot to do, so you must go. Then, walk straight for a month"

I don't believe there is such a thing to any real benefit to other people. We all look at everything from our own point of view, you know. 'Oh, it will never do if I am to see that tree,' said one boy this week. 'I can't go right round it to do it!' But I said to myself that if you wanted to go round it, that was the only way you could get at it. What's the point of a beautiful tree that you can't see it? And how can it beautify the place, if it's not visible to all who are to notice it?\" \"You mean you could say the same of everything?\" \"So long as you can see it! As a boy, I was always very happy to see mountains. I think, that's probably why I grew to like themâthey're always there, and you can't miss them. You don't have to look up to them from the bottom of a valley, like other scenery is likeâat least, mountains are the highest sort of thing, so they look down. But when I was at school, and I wanted to see one, I hadn't so much trouble. We had the best view of the most famous mountains in the world outside of the actual Mount Everest. If I'd thought of it at the time, I probably could have seen them from the school windows. So what was I in favour of going out for?\" She turned to Lief, who was watching her closely. \"You knowâyou can't quite make out if I can see through you yet, or not,\" he said. \"I feel as if someone's taken a peek over my shoulder and has seen one of my faults. I'm sure I'm not always honest.\" \"That's not such a bad thing as you seem to think,\" said Anne. \"Sometimes, even if you see a fellow down the road for one hundred yards as a 'stinker', you find, in the end, that it was a mistake. And that sort of thing makes it a lot more agreeable to deal with people than you would like to believe. You see them better.\" \"But isn't one sort of dishonest if one lets people see more 'of one self' than one intends?\" asked Lief. \"Well, I suppose you can choose your faults,\" said Anne. \"If you find you have a streak of lying inside you, you could always use it to help people. Just take all the lies you're going to tell out of the 'bank' of lies, and put them all into one pot with a lump of honesty, and, that way you may get rid of the tendency to lie! \"What about your story about being with me at the circus?\" \"Oh, that was all right, if you like,\" said Lief, looking away sheepishly. \"I really liked it, for that matter,\" said Anne. \"So did I,\" agreed Jack. \"I was afraid it would sound false,\" said Lief. \"One sort of lying can be just as bad as the other. A little white lies won't do any harm. It's only when you grow up and you think you can twist people round your little finger that things go wrong.\" \"When does one do that?\" asked Lief, \"And how?\" \"Oh, I expect most people find they begin when they go to high school. It's then you begin to be different from your fellows, and you must either try and be accepted by them, or to be special. Of course, you can try both at once, but that makes things pretty well out of hand for you, as a rule.

What can you tell me about these satellites? What era were they developed? Are they still active, and what are their approximate capabilities thought to be?\n\n(0.2) The first of those spy-sats were called Coronal. Coronal is actually a reference to Venus because of the corona the planet emits. The first of them is called KeyHole 1, and was deployed in (I believe) 1960 and remained in orbit for 6 years.\n\n(0.3) It was the largest spy-sat of those times, but it was also the only one of them.\n\n(0.4) Its capabilities are mostly classified, but are thought to be roughly 40cm resolution. While that's not good enough to discern cars on highways, it is sufficient for any other purpose.\n\n\n(0.5) The only reason there were any others were because they needed to develop a more advanced one and to learn as they went along.\n\n(0.6) There's no reason why it should be more advanced now, because today there is absolutely no risk of anybody other than the Russians or the Chinese getting access to it. All of the information that would've been useful for the US since the 60's to today has been processed and disseminated. The only information that one would theoretically be able to glean from these satellites is weather data, which is no value to anybody.\n\n\n*Q: What might happen if Kessler's syndrome occured in space (I had thought it would be pretty bad in itself, but it seems like it would also be a huge problem for satellites??)\n\n(0.1) It has no impact, because all the communications satellites are already protected from it. These are all the ones with large high strength metal shieldings, and if something in the space or between the Earth and its satellites gets knocked out, it would collide with one of these. With nothing very sharp, the space between spacecraft is about 30-40 miles, while 40-50 is the average gap between satellites.\n\n*Q: Do you believe an asteroid-deflection space program could be developed?\n\n(0.1) The fact that it already exists and has the capability to deflect them outwards shows that it might be able to. Though there is nothing that could be done with asteroids coming towards the Earth, so it would just be an ineffectual deflection of them.\n\n*Q: Do you believe that private companies would be an ideal form of space commercialization, or should they be handled by a central government? (this was confusing, because I first read it as having two separate questions, but in retrospect it seems like it's one question with a long answer)\n\n(0.1) The one I had in mind was about the idea of private firms being allowed to do space research and development only, as in, not getting any kind of license or approval. And the answer is that there are no laws or barriers to it, so anybody can do that. However, there are some regulations, such as about keeping out of orbits that might cause collisions, which have been enforced by NASA. And, they also don't have permission to develop a rocket engine without the authorization of NASA.\n\n(0.2) That said, I think that space exploration by private companies would be awesome, because they're unencumbered by any kind of bureaucracy, and they are only bound by their own company's bottom lines.\n\n\n*Q: What technologies were developed by NASA programs (i.e., in addition to shuttle and lunar rover, etc.) that have found application anywhere else?\n\n(0.1) The most famous one is certainly the gyroscope, which is now used in video games and in all forms of the internet.\n\n\n\n*Q: What percentage of funding goes to space research, and if a specific item/program is cut for money, how much do you think people on the ground would be affected by it?\n\n(0.1) It would be a few percent of funding of every type of program. I'd estimate that a 1% cut to space research would be 20 million dollars - if NASA were to cut its own budget, perhaps 100 million.\n\n*Q: How much would you expect to spend (all things considered: inflation, inflation, inflation) to build an orbiting factory?\n\n(0.1) It's going to be like building any other factory in Earth"

        "output": "Can you list the issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modelling problems? What advantages does your method have over others in solving these issues?\nI'm also interested in the difference in the solution to using a symmetric probability distribution vs a discrete probability distribution, if one uses a machine learning algorithm to solve the problem.\n\nA: To model the problem as a symmetric distribution simply requires that you take the average of two random samples, where the first comes with the given probability distribution over $X$ and the second follows the same distribution over $Y$, but in reverse order.\nI see little value in this.\nI'm not very familiar with symmetrical distribution but what I've seen it to work on (possibly not related to the present question) it is not able to capture something when we combine the problem with another variable, like when we have some sort of causality in between. I've tried modelling something as a symmetric distribution and then try to model another variable with the same distribution. The only way I could make the two fit together was to take a more complex distribution with a larger number of parameters.\nYour other two questions don't hold as much meaning I think. It's no problem that the probability distribution is symmeteric: it models anything that is symmetric about a probability, so it models both the distribution but also any variation of it. The same is not true for discrete distributions: for example we can't apply a gamma distribution without a specification of the shape and rate parameters.\n\nA: The main issue with using symmetric distributions is that it's not quite symmetric over time. With discrete distributions, you need to flip the time variable ($X$ and $Y$) to make it symmetric.\nHowever, there are also a lot of advantages using symmetric distributions, in particular for the following:\nIf you want to apply a machine learning algorithm to symmetric distributions, the first step is to split time. In general, symmetric distribution can be seen as a time-lagged sequence. For a given $x \\in (0,1)$, the time lagged values look like this:\n$$\n\\begin{matrix}\n(0,0), (1/2, 1/2), (0, 1/2), (1/2,0), \\dots \\vdots\n\\end{matrix}\n$$\nFor example, the Gamma distribution can be used for any integer in the interval $\\theta \\in [1, \\left\\lfloor r\\right\\rfloor]$ and $\\lambda\\in [0,r^{\\left\\lfloor \\left\\lfloor r \\right\\rfloor/2\\right\\rfloor}]$. However, you can also choose any other pair of integers.\n\nTherefore, if you use symmetric distributions, the time distribution can be seen as an unequal time interval, which lets us apply machine learning directly.\n\nAnother advantage is that you can easily convert symmetric distributions into discrete distributions by simply taking the average of the value from both sides of the window and discarding the rest:\n$$\n    X = \\frac{\\sum \\{x_i\\}}{2} \\mbox{ and } Y=\\frac{\\sum \\{y_i\\}}{2}\n$$\nThis is a discrete procedure, which allows us to treat it as a discrete model.\n\nSymmetric distributions also make it easy to visualize distributions. For example, the above graph of Gamma distribution has four branches from 0 to +1 and two from -1 to 0. From symmetric perspective, it's a symmetric set that has an equal probability for every point on the line $y=x$.\n\nWith symmetric distributions, you don't have to worry about the order of time data.\nIn general, you can treat symmetric distributions as a time lagged sequence with an equal probability for every point. You don't need to worry about taking care of time data, you can use any machine learning algorithm just the way you do for discrete data."

This one was hard because you cannot enter the trail when it’s too cold. The temperature has to be 3-5 degrees above freezing and the trail must have at least one inch of snow cover which can sometimes take months to get there.\nThe other one is the Wet Mountain Trail. The Wet Mountain trail is 150 miles in size and is one of the longest hiking trails in the state of Colorado. It takes you through valleys, forests, and past a number of rivers. You will be amazed by all the wildlife you will see and how many times the trail will cross or pass by an old bridge. Some of the other trails that you can do if you’re up for a hike the following week in Colorado is the Trail Ridge Trail in Rocky Mountain National Park. This trail is located in Estes Park and is 45 miles of trail filled with wildlife and beautiful views of the mountains. You will see a variety of wildlife, but the moose and bears are easily spotted.\nAnother good hike you can do is in Rocky Mountain National Park and it’s called the North Ridge Trail. If you enjoy bird watching you will get a good view of the birds when you hike to the North Ridge Trail. You can also take the Bear Lake Trail which is a three mile hike to see some of the wildlife, and is located in Estes Park. If you have some time and need a more in-depth hike you can try the Colorado Trail. This trail is 500 miles across the state and is one of the most challenging trails to hike.

I am making a Caesar dressing and I really want to get this mayo made.\nWhen making a Caesar dressing the mayo is only the base layer. The actual dressing is made much later on.\nI made one batch of Baked Chicken with the lemon, garlic, pimento & olive sauces and 1 with a mustard brown sauce. I am really disappointed with my results. None of them had the flavor I was looking for.\nI can understand since the actual sauces were a little on the sweet side. However, if we were at a restaurant I would order a plain (or perhaps garlic) mayo, and put that on top of the chicken. It would work…..although the chicken would taste a bit bland.\nThank you! I’m going to try it that way! Is there a type of vinegar that wouldn’t make the food bitter? I’m doing the chicken in a crockpot with herbs, asparagus, olives, lemon, garlic, and olive sauce (sweet).\nWe don’t recommend adding sugar to the recipe as that will make it bitter. We do like vinegar, however, as a flavoring agent and not to sweeten it. You can try a little rice vinegar or even champagne vinegars.\nHi! I made this today and used it for both of the sauces. My question is, how can I store the remaining un-used sauce? When it is sitting on my counter for a few days, it starts to lose its fresh flavor. I know that this is because the citric acid has started to break down and it has an off smell. Can I store this in the fridge, or should I avoid this?\nYes we do recommend cooling it down and then storing it in the refrigerator prior to using.\nI made the garlic, pimento & lemon for Sunday lunch and it was very very good. In fact, I asked my guests for the recipe – a first!\nThat is fantastic! Glad to hear it was successful for you!\nI have an ingredient question about the lemon olive sauce (which, by the way, had already been tested on our tastebuds).\nIt calls for 1/8 tsp of citric acid. What does that equate to? 5 ml, 10 ml, 20 or 40? I’ve never seen citric acid in grocery stores.\nI’ve been a long time reader and user of your website. I love the recipes, but this is my first question to you.\nHello! I have a question about the garlic olive sauce: Is the citric acid optional?\nIt does have a slightly acidic edge to it so we recommend it to enhance the flavor.\nI have been doing a lot of experimenting with my sauces and find that as all my sauces are done without added sugar, but with the acidifying ingredients like citric acid and acid lime juice I often find that the final texture doesn’t give the full satisfaction of the creamy texture that is expected when using a mayonnaise.\nMy question is, how is that it is possible to have sauce that has a nice sour taste and yet still be creamy. How can one create that creamy texture?\nWe don’t recommend using lemon juice. It will turn your oil/egg mixture to runny liquid. We recommend adding vinegar, wine vinegar, or even better, champagne vinegar. Both have a slightly sweet and almost tart flavor so you won’t get the kind of unpleasant burning in the back of your throat that you get if you use lemon juice directly on a egg mayonnaise.\nI’m guessing all of this is using extra-virgin olive oil? If so, do you really do it without even touching it? I thought that would be an impossibility!\nHello again. I make a delicious pasta sauce with homemade mayonnaise, but it has a sour tang to it; it has lemon and maybe 1/2 tablespoon of sugar to make it not too sour. So what would you"

        "instruction": "Why does the second batch of pancakes brown much faster?",
        "output": "Why does the second batch of pancakes brown much faster? Why do we need more oil to cook the second batch?\n\nThe first batch of pancakes contains a lot of air between the flakes. When you cook the second batch, the first batch provides a large volume of pockets of trapped air. These air pockets create lots of convex, hot spots which generate a lot of heat, causing food in the pancakes to cook quickly.\n\nWhen cooking another batch, we need more oil because:\n\n  The first batch creates a large volume of air bubbles in the pan\n  Paddling and pounding food also spreads it out, making more surfaces available for cooking\n\nThe more air in a food product, the thinner the food, the faster a food is cooked.\n\n### How fat changes the cook time\n\nFats and oils slow the cook rate down by 3 to 5 minutes. The slower rate is because a lot of surface area is needed to create convex, hot spots for generating heat. Cook times are affected to a lesser degree when fats and oils are used together, as these can mix or split with the water in the base flour. Fat, combined with an alkaline (phosphoric) acid base, can produce lard, which is a more solid food.\n\n#### PHOSPHORUS ACIDS\n\nFats also provide protection for our pancakes, against:\n\n  Starchy and sugary foods so these don't change colours\n  Enzymes so the food does not decompose\n  Acids so the food does not go off\n\n### Starchy foods\n\nSome of the foods we love so much, may change colour, or change in texture too quickly for us to eat.\n\n  A starchy food is high in soluble starch.\n  A sweet food is low in soluble starch.\n\nA starch (soluble) and sugar (insoluble) type of product will change colour due to a chemical reaction, called gelatinization, when heated. For example, some fruits may be green when they are chilled after cooking, but will change colour due to gelatinization when heated.\n\nA food product contains a mix of soluble and insoluble starch (sugar):\n\n  Fruit and vegetables\n  Oils\n  Nuts\n  Rice\n  Potatoes\n\n##### FLAVOUR\n\n  A sweet food may have the same taste as a sweet food, but it will still have a very different texture.\n  A sweet food may taste sweet while cooking, but it will still turn brown.\n  A very sweet food, like a sugar lump, will eventually melt.\n\n##### GELATINOUS AND NON-GELATINOUS STARS\n\nThere is a very small difference between a food that will turn brown, and one that will not change colour. It becomes a little obvious when we mix starchy and non-starchy foods together. The first product we try has the flavour we expect. The second will be changed in texture, but not in flavour.\n\n##### TASTING\n\nThe taste of a food will change when we heat it up. It may stay the same, or it may change from a sweet taste to an astringent taste.\n\n##### COLOURING\n\nSome fruits and vegetables have a green colour, like apple, banana and avocados, which become yellow-green when heated, then yellow-brown when heated more.\n\n### How we taste a food\n\nWe taste three main parts of a given food:\n\n  The flavour of the food\n  The texture of the food\n  The feeling in our mouth\n\nThe texture of a food is a combination of the three elements below...\n\n  The amount of fat. For example, a small amount of fat in the food product changes the feel and how much we can eat.\n  Fat changes to fat-soluble vitamins when heated.\n  A small amount of fat will make food taste more flavoursome when heated. This is because:\n\nThe fat has a low melting point, which is why it is easy to melt it down in small quantities.\nThe fat coats the food, so we cannot taste everything.\nWe prefer a flavour with a rich and full taste.\n  Our lipids change with the flavour. So when we taste a food with fat in it, it has a richer and fuller flavour.\n  Our sense of taste and smell.\n  The mouthfeel of food â the way something feels.\n  There are several factors that affect the mouthfeel of food:\n\n  Fat and oil: adds creaminess and fullness\n  Fat helps a food feel thicker because oil coats the food.\n  Sugars: can make food feel dry, sticky, slimy and sticky"

How do you envision the role of religion in public life according to the Charter and what is the future of Islam in a global setting, if you happen to believe that Islam is a religion that is at its core peaceful and can contribute in a positive way to the societies in the world that are governed by other religions?\nAs to the above questions, Ill be writing some things up, so I may have to hold off giving you an answer right away. It is interesting to see so many in this age and time wanting to know if our lives and those that take place in this world will turn out to be a paradise, whether the world can be rid of evil or whether we can eliminate disease, illness and suffering.\nAll I am saying is that there needs to be a balance and if one looks at the history of life on this planet, there are those societies and people that have a history where they know that we have had a relationship with God or God(s) since the beginning of time.\nIn fact, if we take a look at the history of mankind, people had a much different approach and understanding of the ways of the universe and this was reflected in how they lived their life and behaved themselves.\nIt is in the last several hundred years, most especially during the past 300 years that a huge paradigm shift occurred.\nScience was beginning to make advances and it was during this same time period the Christian churches were being deconstructed and then reconstructed as well.\nWith this reconstruction came a shift that occurred in the thought process of mankind in general.\nThe shift was not in the understanding of ourselves or the universe but in understanding and viewing our Creator, in the person of God which was not a singular person but three and one.\nIt was in the new conception of man, himself, that mankind in the modern 20th century adopted the concept that was so foreign to what they had known before, and this was in the ideas of man and his God. The God, he was taught in college, was not a personal God who was present but instead in the form of an impersonal law, a Law of the Universe that existed everywhere and it was this Law that would be the answer.\nIn the beginning, God created humankind in his own image. This was the first teaching given to humankind. The problem here was that the Bible doesnt say what was meant by the images or what that meant, so in the new religions that were being formed they took to interpreting this passage.\nThis is where the problem occurs, in the interpretation of this single passage. For, what is meant by the word image?\nThe first answer that was to be given to this question came in the form of a cartoon image that was being utilized by the American cartoon makers. This was a character from the Disney production that was to be utilized for children and this was the character of Mickey Mouse.\nAs you can see here, what people did was take a humanoid figure and then give him the power of speaking. The problem though, is that they took for granted in their thinking that as far as the laws of physics were concerned and in the idea of what humans were, he was just a man.\nThis is a concept that was born out of modern science that we were here and that humans were capable of great things, and as far as the laws of physics were concerned, humans were just a little bigger and stronger than other mammals and that was the end of it.\nIn other words, the laws of physics and science had nothing to say about the idea of the afterlife and whether there was such a thing to begin with.\nIn fact, just as people were beginning to explore the limits of what was possible with the use of technology and space, people were told by science, particularly after the Cold War, that science couldnt find God, yet, here, we had people making advances and coming up with the information that couldnt find God then trying to define that person based on their own experience and that was because people had the idea that God was the big daddy and he was all powerful but he was also all powerful in a way that made him impossible to know and understand.\nWith the cartoon character, he was being anthropomorphized and people were looking for something like this, where they could have a personal relationship with God, something that was possible in previous religions.\nIn the first world religions that were based on a mon"

Travel time is going to come up a lot when we are doing these calculations because it affects how quickly the particles move around and we want a system where these travel times are small compared to the other times that I have. For one thing, it makes it easier to calculate and, for another, it means we're not going to be changing the times that we calculate by too much with the travel time because we'll be changing them by about the same amount.\nNow we are going to start thinking about how to actually write down the evolution equations for these models and there's two versions we're going to talk about and when I say the two versions I mean the two methods or two kinds of models. I'm going to talk about a system of PDEs first and then a system of ODE's. The PDE's are, like we've just seen, they're really equations that you're going to put, this is for the next three hours, between 0 and 3, but those don't matter as much to me as the time step and then I'm going to be looking at ODE's as well and they're also going to give us a time varying equation that we can write down with time step 1 seconds. So I'm going to do the system of PDE's first and these equations are really easy to understand the way that they are written but I do have to give the full form of the equations, which I do want to do it's very important to remember because, as we learn more about particle systems, they're going to give us a way to find solutions when we can't figure it out the other way around and this is a system of three PDE's.\nOn the top left, I'm going to have two scalar quantities that will describe these things that are flowing around, so one of them is a number, $\\phi_{t}(x,y,z)$ and then the other one is going to be $u_z(t,x,y,z)$ and I will put that in italics because that means we are taking the derivatives with respect to $z$ and you can see my notation is very confused because $\\phi$ is the only one that has its capital letters capitalized. The one that is not capitalized is going to be just $u$, not $U$ and that's because when we take a derivative $D_z = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ and a time derivative $t$ gets written with a $d$ and the other notation has to be lower case because it's the same thing that I'm doing when I write $d_t$. So that's just a note about that. So what we have first is we have $\\phi_t$ and it's the $t$ derivative of $\\phi$ and then $u_z$ is the $z$ derivative of $u$ and I'm going to put that in italics and I just wanted it emphasized. Now the way I put these things together I'm going to write this equation again and I'm going to write the $t$ and $z$ derivative in the subscript as $D$ to make the $t$ and $z$ clear and then I'm going to write the scalars I've written like this in the same line and I'm going to separate out the $D_t$ and $D_z$ by a comma just to remind us that there are two quantities there.\nSo now we can look at the equation. We have $D_t \\phi$ and that's the time derivative of the number, $D_z u$ and those are $D_t \\phi = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}$ and $D_z u = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}$ and $ D_t \\phi = -  (u \\cdot D_z u) - \\left(\n\\epsilon\\left(\\frac{\\partial ^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}+ \\frac{\\partial ^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} \\right)+ \\mu \\frac{\\partial ^2 \\phi}{\\partial z^2} \\right) + F(x, y, z)$. $t$ is going to be the number of hours that we're talking about"

        "instruction": "How to start learning guitar and become a master at it?",
        "output": "How to start learning guitar and become a master at it?\nOne of the most frequent questions a beginner asks themselves is: How do I learn to play guitar properly?. This might be because most people start playing guitar on social media and they start to realize that the way they are playing right now is not the way they are suppose to play. For the beginner the best idea would be to go look for teachers that are passionate about playing and show all of the students how to do it the right way. Also, finding a teacher that can help you understand what guitar is is very important because this will make sure that every lesson is focused more on technique than on theory which most people start with. This will make you focus on developing your ability and making sure you are learning everything.\nSince guitar players work with their hands the best way to learn guitar is not to use videos to teach yourself, instead, a teacher can teach you these things at a much faster rate. Another thing a beginner might think would be to start playing the guitar without looking at the fretboard or learning about the technique for picking. This not only slows you down as a beginner but also slows you down in your progress because your hand just starts to get stiff and your fingers will get sore very quickly without any understanding why.\nOnce you learn some techniques like picking and fretting notes and you can figure out how to play your first chords, the next step is to read and understand some basic guitar theories. This will make you understand the sound that the guitar creates and what type of fingerings is used to change the sound. This also leads us to our next point and that would be scales and intervals because these are the backbone of any instrument including guitar. This also makes you understand that the first thing you will start to learn is how to play a 12-bar blues which is basically one of the most common patterns that most people use. This will make you understand why this is used and also make it easier for you to understand why people use this type of chords and how it's used in any music. Once you've learned all this stuff and are able to practice and perform the blues like a pro (just like we showed you it is easy in our tutorial How to play the blues) now its time for you to begin to learn different scales and intervals so you can start to play any chord you want and play any of the different popular scales. Our next article is going to cover other concepts you should be focusing on once you start having a more in-depth knowledge of music.\nHow to read guitar tabs?\nAs a beginner learning guitar the best method at this point in time would be to watch a few videos about how to read guitar tablature so you can learn some basic techniques for reading music without actually having to get any knowledge of music theory. In our next article we will cover some things that even after you have learned everything in the theory tab would be useful for the new beginner guitar player.\nWhat is Chords and how to play them?\nThere are a bunch of chords that use open and closed positions but also a smaller group of other chords. Once you have played and learned a lot more you will be able to start learning some other stuff like how to play minor and major chords so you can begin to play different chords in different keys and also open a lot of other doors that you didn’t use to before. Our website is going to discuss some of those chords that you should learn so you can be very well skilled when you first start.\nWhat notes to start with in Open Tuning?\nThe first step in learning a new instrument is to learn how to make sounds with all the different notes on it which means the first time you should learn all the basics to figure out which ones are open, which ones are closed. After that you should make sure that when you are learning some scales you will make sure you can also play in different keys so you can be very flexible to learn more and understand some of the other concepts and not be stuck in one key or a few. This is something you should work on when you are first starting out but also something that you’ll continue to improve upon when you become more skilled as a guitar player.\nHow can I start playing different guitar styles?\nOne of the best ways to start learning guitar is to start learning different styles and be flexible so you can create unique stuff on your own with the knowledge of different theories and chords. This also makes you a more creative person as a player and able to improvise on guitar on your own.\nWhat will be the first skill to learn?\nThere isn’t a better way to start than to learn about music theory because this will make your way much easier and will make everything you learn very easy. After that the next thing that you should take into consideration is learning how to use some gear because if you want to play a more complex instrument this becomes a lot more easier once you understand your gear and start to play.

        "output": "Is there a true, most ethical response to the Trolley Problem, in which a person can either sacrifice the lives of 5 people, by not pulling a lever, or sacrifice the life of 1 person, but have to pull the lever themselves, thus directly causing that death by action, rather than causing 5 deaths, but by inaction? Do you ever feel that you should have sacrificed your life to save others?\nA: My answer to the trolley problem is that there is no solution. I have seen several interesting answers to this question- people being pushed to extremes like either sacrificing your 10-year-old son or saving the 100-year-old in such situations. They all try to give a rational, pragmatic answer and show the logical consequences of their decision. In my view, this does not work. We should keep what we believe- there's nothing we can do about it- and follow our hearts and conscience in such situations, even if that leads to a tragic end.\n-- I'm paraphrasing\nQ: The second person who asked me for advice was a woman who, in her 40's, just married her first-time partner. She described being married as wonderful and felt that her first marriage had been a mistake. She said that her first husband had not been a good person and that their home had been violent and abusive. But she said that she was an excellent mother, that her kids loved each other very much and were all growing up to be wonderful young adults -- just what she wanted. She had now married again and was very much in love with her partner. But she wondered whether she was wrong to have moved on and to have married again. And she wondered whether it was ok to be happy when so much pain was involved in the first marriage.\nA: I can only answer this personally. I have been married three times (not counting being married and divorced once when I was 16). It's my own view that there are just some marriages that are not meant to work out in the long run. In the case of my first marriage, we had moved away at different times, we had been separated for a year and that marriage was over. And it was a violent and abusive marriage, but it was the end of an abusive marriage--not the beginning or middle of one. Our mutual therapist, had said that we had moved on and that we were \"too nice to each other\". We also had four kids who loved each other very much. But it was also true that we both had been miserable and unhappy. So that's an extremely painful and messy divorce if you want to stay married.\nBut on the other hand, my second marriage really hurt. It was because my new wife had been unfaithful to me, I left her, we divorced. We remain in touch to this day. It was more complicated--more of an affair, but it had been an honest affair. Still I am very happy now and I don't feel that I've done wrong. We didn't raise our kids together--we were divorced before the kids were born, but they turned out well.\nMy third marriage was great--for the kids. We have a strong marriage, but we have one kid who doesn't like me and so I was happy to see them all and not just my wife.\nFor people who can afford a divorce, you can afford to be nice, for a while. But eventually you can't.\nYou have to weigh your life in context--what other choices you're making. Have you made other important commitments? That I don't know. But there are no good or bad decisions. It's just that they're not working. That's why I was divorced as soon as I could.\nOn the whole, I've been a good person--if I can call it a good or a bad person. My kids are happy because I am a person who is a decent human being. And, I am a decent human being for choosing to step away from the marriage.\nQ: One of my favorite things about you is your openness and candor about your feelings, mistakes, and feelings about the world. But, as a person who has had some exposure to what's out there, I was wondering if you ever felt afraid? I was thinking of a lot of people, here, living in cities and with a great deal of financial stability that you have.\nA: There's a difference between living your life and being scared. And there's a difference between being scared and living your life. For example, I'm pretty scared of driving over the Brooklyn Bridge--I have to be careful when I drive. But I'm going to go out and ride a motorcycle at Pikes Peak this weekend. Now, that's a little scary, but that'"

        "output": "How do I normalize a vector?\nI have a data set. I know it is too high dimensional, so I have used PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 13 (so the first 13 eigenvectors are used). I know, that I cannot use this as the only data that is being used, so I should probably also normalize the vectors.\nI have used the standard procedure: divided by the row sum. However, this produces huge values, e.g. 29641. Does this make sense to normalize in this way? \nI have heard that one can normalize by the mean or the standard deviation, which would be a better thing to do. Does anybody know an easy way to normalize this way?\nI currently do not have a function to normalize this by using all the entries. This might have been a good thing to use before if I knew that my data were high-dimensional.\nThank you\nUPDATE\nThis is how the data looks like.\nSo the first 10 and last 10% contain information, but the middle part does not. I know, that, I should get rid of it, but I want to understand first how to normalize it.\n\n\nA: I would start with a preliminary normalization by division by row-sum as you are doing - that should make your data more comparable between rows and that ought to capture some of the variance, even if it is a crude approximation - e.g., you should avoid extreme values. But it does make the data less interpretable/comparable because it means you are not comparing features. What you want is to normalize your variables so that they all have zero-mean and unit-variance.\n\nA: I would like to share with you an approach that does not require you to normalizing with a global mean and global variance.\nYou can create a feature vector with your 13 features and call them Z and use\nZ'*Z/Tr(Z'*Z)\n\nas your new Z and then project the whole thing onto a new plane and you'll see what is most or least influential using principal component analysis.\nIf you are interested what kind of information you still have in your high features dimension, you can do\neigenVecs = eig(sum(Z)) \neigenVecs = tril(eigenVecs) #since the columns are now ordered by decreasing contribution, we need to change the matrix into tri-diagonal matrix form for further analysis (this is your new Z')\n\nand then calculate the variance using var(eigenVecs), a measure of 'how much you have left out'\nBut your method is fine.\nJust see how many the data varies and see the results."

Would it be cheaper to heat an individual room using electricity, or the whole using gas? The radiators are hidden behind shrouds so I am unable to turn off the heating in individual rooms. I realise that there are a series of variables and it is likely a fairly complex question, but I am happy to try and understand the general principles.\nI suppose this is an engineering question, rather than a pure science question, but it falls in the realm of physics, so it is probably a physics website that is best to ask this sort of question.\nThe best way to heat your home is directly related to the amount of energy you emit into the outside--either directly or indirectly.\nElectricity has a lower specific heat than gas. The heating process is different. In a gas burning heater, the gas is drawn into the heater, and then ignites in the air. As a result, a significant amount of the input energy is used to heat the air that contains the fuel. In an electrical heater, the energy is directly used to warm the fluid.\nThe amount of energy you emit also depends on the size of the heater. Larger heaters allow for greater fluid velocity, which means that it is possible to heat a larger amount of fluid in a fixed amount of time. It doesn't change the total energy input, it is just a question of how quickly you get it to heat up.\nYou may find it useful to convert one unit to the other to see which is the cheapest and most efficient for a particular heating application.\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "output": "I am learning Mandarin. Could you give me some advice to memorize how to write Chinese characters and speed up my learning?\nThis is my website too. But it is not so good. I would like to ask you for your advices. I am a high school student and my English is not so good.\nThank you for your interest in the AE community. Learning to write Chinese is a long process but I can give you some ideas to help you, if you would like. I have written about how to learn Chinese characters in another post, which you may want to read. A few things that will help you memorize some of the characters will be learning some words with those characters on them (similar to our English word roots), using them in contexts (the old saying, \"the more you use it, the more it comes back to you\") and getting your mind around some of the basic principles of Chinese characters. There is only so much you can do with Chinese characters, particularly in the first couple years of learning Chinese. I have included some suggestions below and a link to where I have written more about it, along with other resources for learning Chinese characters.\nRemember, Chinese is a phonetic language, so learning the basic syllabicity of the characters will help with your pronunciation, even if you have never learned Chinese. You can learn syllabic tones by studying some common words with those characters on them and then making your own pronunciation guide. This will also help you learn the tone of certain words and you'll be able to learn your own pronunciation using that \"dictionary\".\nDo characters that make more sense to you, like words beginning with the same pronunciation. For example, \"ch\" means to chop or cut and \"shu\" means a tree, so you can think of \"ch\" + \"shu\" and it sounds like it will be a word that means to chop a tree. A simple tool online to help you with syllabity is called \"The Chinese Word Puzzle\" (link is at the end of this post). This way you can pick words like \"ci + shu\" by looking at the syllables, but it will also make you read the syllables the sound out phonetically. Some other quick tools are Sogou Pinyin and Baidu Pinyin. You can go through and make your first few lists here.\nThere are also pinyin lists and pronunciation guides for most words at the Mandarin Depot site where you can hear the sounds of the pinyin and also find a way to sound it out on a \"Key of Pinyin\" (it's a 10-key calculator). You can go to the link below and register. When you register you can find some free downloads. You can also use the free pinyin for every character if you need to.\nYou can make your character lists on the \"key of syllabity\" (not pinyin) and you can see both the pinyin and syllabity on the same page with the mouse pointer. If you follow along with the syllabities and sound out the pinyin, I think this will be very helpful. If you would like to download this page and a pinyin key to use with it, click on the link below.\nAnother tool I use for learning syllabity is a program called \"Pinyin Tester II\", which will help you learn syllables. You can learn the basics first, but you can play a series of tests with different levels and speed. You get the sound correct and you get rewards. It will also work on a phone (on iOS, you can download it from the App Store; on Android, you can download it from the Google Play Store).\nI have used the program \"New Chinese Words\" for my vocabulary.\nThis is a free program which has Chinese characters and the pinyin. The pronunciation is shown by a picture. The pinyin is spelled out phonetically on the page. In some ways, I think it is a little easier to learn the sounds this way, but I think I use it when I want to go through a list and find a character. For me, I feel that I do better in learning using the sound pronunciation of syllables and syllables of Chinese characters.\nThis resource is a combination of the Mandarin Depot pinyin list and the character list found at Zhongwen.com. You will hear the pinyin as you click on the character. This is a great way to get more pronunciation practice, if you want to use something besides your computer speakers. In both cases, you can register for free and get several tools.\nOnce you have those, go ahead and make your lists and memorize and sound them out each day. This is the best way to learn them, but you can use whatever tools work for you. I hope it helps.\nI"

So dabbing is often associated with someone who, say, might like to try pot but does not want to become a full-time marijuana user.\nProdigy, a rapper of the group Mobb Deep (which includes his brother, a rapper and producer named Havoc), was sentenced to nine to 20 years in prison on May 27, 2002 after being found guilty of attempted murder and gun possession. After an attempt to escape jail, he was sent back to prison to serve time.\nThere are only two steps to making a dab. First, pour out a little bit of wax right onto the metal heat gun, and put another little bit of wax in the bottom half. Heat the wax until it starts to melt, then stick the spoon into the jar containing the wax or concentrate so that as much wax comes onto it as you can.\n100% LEGAL: Federal law doesn’t prohibit smoking on school property nor does it prohibit adults from smoking cannabis on their own property. … Smoking cannabis on school grounds can pose problems for you and your teen, but you have the responsibility to educate them about both the laws and the"

I, like you, feel it is a form of theft and a complete lack of respect for an artist’s work. That said, I think he made a bad call here.\nHere is the thing though, I go back and forth on whether or not I would have pulled the same stunt Harlan did. I am not 100% sure I would have, and of this I am sure – if my college had access to the books I wanted I would have gone out on bended knee and begged them for it. I would have treated that book like it was a piece of my own personality, or a part of my life that I cannot re-invent. I see the actual act of copying the book as more of theft, of replacing my own personal presence from that experience with someone else’s.\nAnd, I guess that is where a lot of people will disagree -when you buy a book, read it, and then copy it, you are committing the same crime as when you did nothing at all. The difference is that you now have a copy of it and can consume it at will, not only do you not respect the time that the author committed to writing it, but you do not respect your own time spent reading it either, I think that is the point Harlan is trying to make. I just wish it was more clear.\nAlso, I think that, at the time, a lot of people saw Harlan as a Luddite, when in reality he was an early adopter. He saw the future of the industry, and it being digital only only gave the publishers more power, as they could just remove your account and let you try to get it back again. Whereas, if he had kept a real, tangible book he could have given that to his wife, and even keep it himself if he so chose to do so.\nHe could still get it from the library for free, and you still have the book you bought.\nOne day you will run out of room in your house for such books.\nIf people get books that they borrowed from the library or bought from other sources in digital format, they can either upload them to a cloud storage for offline use, or they can upload a backup to a drive that’s kept at someone else’s house and they can download it and have it on an E-reader or something that can read it offline.\nIt’s still not a perfect solution, but it gives people a lot of options.\nOn the other hand, there’s just one single copy of the actual paper book and as you say, publishers can just cut you out of having it altogether.\nMy personal opinion is that if they make it hard to get access to books from a single source, people will always move on to other things, or the information will move around other places.\nAnd if people start feeling like, well, it’s too much trouble to get something so long as it’s just a paper book, then at least the publishers won’t be losing sales.\nIf they’re just going to make it too hard for people, then they’ll just be a niche market. And they can’t survive on being a niche market forever.\nBut for things like textbooks and manuals, it’s a necessity.\nYou buy a physical book, or a physical CD, and it’s only licensed to you so you can have it for as long as you bought it from them.\nIt’s still not a perfect solution because there’s always the fear that they’ll change their licensing rules which means you can’t use the copies you own anymore, but I’ve heard that people do just that with physical books because they feel the digital version is more expensive.\nSo I’d say for the most part there’s still a solution.\nI mean, just today, my son’s school asked us to set up an e-book library that has more than 10,000 books.\nWhat?! That’s just sooo much e-book crap!\nMy son is only in kindergarten, and he will have to learn to read… What are they doing? I mean, yeah, they might have good intentions, I don’t know, but I have some reservations. But to say that they wouldn’t have it without the digital option is just nonsense.\nOne of the reasons why people still want physical books is convenience. It’s so much easier to pull out a hardcover book from your bookcase instead of reaching for"

        "output": "Explain the difference between sets and lists in Python.\nDescribe how to create a data structure with a list and a set, and explain when to use each type of data structure\nCompare lists to other methods of performing operations with sequences\nUse python to create a list of integers, a set of integers and compare the two\nList and Set in Python\nPython lists and sets are used for storing data that has elements with duplicate values or a random order. When we use a list of integers to store the values of our numbers, the order of the values will be kept as the list was created. In other words, the values will be stored in the order in which they were added. The elements are not ordered, which means that they can be reordered as needed. They are not sorted but can be sorted.\nWhen we want to store a collection of values with duplicate values and a random order we should use the set data type. A set does not have duplicate elements, and you cannot assign two different values to the same set, so we can assign multiple values to the set but the set will be different for each value. It is sort of like a hash set; the same values cannot be stored in the set, just different values.\nWe cannot add a set to a list like we can add values to a list. To add a list to a list, we just concatenate the list onto itself with the + operator. We do this to create a new list by combining two or more lists.\nList to set\nlist = ['green', 'green', 'green', 'green', 'green']\nset = set(list)\nThis statement sets the variable named list to a list and the set to a set.\nlist-set=['green', 'green', 'green', 'green', 'green']\nThe set that is stored in the variable named set contains all the values that are stored in the list in the list variable. We could just print the set and the values that are in the set would be displayed to the screen.\nset is '{'green','green','green','green','green'\nTo convert a list to a set, we can use the .copy() function. This function creates a list that contains a copy of all the elements of a list. Then we can add it to the set. Using this function we can create a set that contains all the values of a list but not duplicate values.\nlist1=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]\nlist1.copy().append(1)\nlist2=list1.copy()\n#list2-set={'green','green','green','green','green',3}\n#set.update(list2)\n#'{'1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 3}\nA set has two special methods: the copy() method and update() method. The copy() method creates a list that contains a copy of all the elements of the set, and the update() method adds the values of the list to the set. The values of the copy() method are stored in a list called list2 while list2 is the set created from the elements.\nset={'green','green','green','green','green'}\nset.update(list2)\nset.update([5, 5])\n'{'1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 3}'\nNow it is clear that the values in the set are in a random order and duplicate values are not allowed.\nComparison Between a Set and List\nWe can see from the two examples above that a set is much more efficient than a list. The set data structure allows us to make a set from a list with only a few lines of code. If we wanted to do something like this with a list, it would take a lot more code.\nSet and list have different properties, and they also have different methods. Set can be converted to a list or a tuple. List has many methods and you cannot convert it to a set.\nLists, Sets, and Tuples as Data Structures\nA list is used for storing values in numerical order. Set is a collection of distinct values. It means that you can't store multiple values in a set and tuples. Set is used to store data that is unique (only one copy of a value is allowed) and list is used to store data that values can be replicated.\nSet, List, and Set\nA set is not a list. There is only one instance of this data structure in python."

The code isn't very complex, but some code has been changed significantly, and there are things such as a separate learning loop for the target network. In the following code is a complete train script for learning to play Atari; if you prefer not to run it as is, you can find the script here in the code. You may also notice that I've included the code for the 2017 Deepmind Paper. Just run this and your Atari models will be preloaded.\n\n**03-learning-models.py**\n\n## Creating Your Own Code Base for Reinforcement Learning\n\nLet's take a minute to look at the code for this set of models. As noted earlier, these models use the **Atari** **Environment** **.mdl**. This is an environment code base, so we'll need to make sure that we use the appropriate imports for our Python code. This includes Python imports, the Python library for TensorFlow, and a few utility files.\n\nI like to use the __init__.py file for Python imports. This is a good habit because if you ever need to switch between Python 2 and Python 3, you can do this without changing any other part of your environment. I'll define the following imports with a comment indicating I'm loading Python version 3, even though I'm using TensorFlow version 1.4.0:\n\n**__init__.py**\n\n### The 2017 Deepmind Paper Code\n\nIf you're looking for deep learning code that's more basic and not geared toward learning an entire game, this section will help you get back to basics. This model is similar but slightly less complex than the 2017 Deepmind Papers model. However, if you prefer to run this code alone, you'll need to download and install the **Environment.mdl** file; note this file is available for download at deepmind.com/research/publications/21426.

In this connection, we may recall the great Chinese work entitled \"Tao Te Ching\" and especially the description which it gives of Tao as the source, or original state, of all things. \"Tao is the root of all things; Tao is the mother of all things. Tao takes no action, but it moves all; Tao thinks of nothing, yet all things are under its care.\" -- Max Planck\nHowever, the sages also know that Tao cannot be described. Consequently, it is never stated. It can only be sensed. In a sense, Tao can be equated with the \"unseen\" and therefore the \"unknown.\" What, then, are we to make of Tao when \"seeing\" and \"knowing\" are at the core of our existence? What can we discover about our own consciousness when that which makes us conscious, i.e., our awareness of it, cannot be perceived and cannot be known?\nHypnagogia: A Study Guide is a collection of essays, including the above passage, on hypnagogia by Max Planck, one of the world's greatest scientists. Hypnagogia (pronounced hippo-NA-GO-gia), defined by Max Planck as \"that state of consciousness that comes to the fore in the moments immediately preceding sleep and in the moments immediately preceding awakening,\" is perhaps the most mysterious of all human experiences. This unique book presents a thorough investigation into the nature, causes, and effects of hypnagogia, a state that often has people \"feeling\" certain things before actually perceiving them, and offers an explanation of the source and nature of hypnagogia.\nWhile this book reveals that hypnagogia is similar to dream state and near-death states, it ultimately suggests that hypnagogia can be compared to and associated with the \"source\" of consciousness. For this reason, the book contains discussions of hypnagogia and the Mystical Triads and offers suggestions as to why hypnagogia is such a powerful \"state\" of awareness, consciousness, and/or being that those who are aware of hypnagogia often experience certain feelings. In addition, this book explains how hypnagogia causes us to live from one moment to the next, with feelings experienced before what is actually seen.\nIn the book, Max Planck also explains the nature of hypnagogia's effect on our perceptions, dreams, creativity, and other experiences such as those of near-death experiences. He discusses hypnagogia's connection to magic and spiritual experiences. This book offers an explanation as to why hypnagogia feels so \"real\" to those who are aware of it and why it can cause such intense feelings, and includes the thoughts and feelings of those who have experienced hypnagogia and the Mystical Triads. Max Planck discusses the nature of hypnagogia, the causes for hypnagogia, how hypnagogia can be detected, how hypnagogia can be created, how hypnagogia can be used, and how hypnagogia can be used to learn \"what's real.\"\nHypnagogia examines what hypnagogia means and its effects as well as offering a scientific analysis of what hypnagogia is and how it is used by various people and people of various states of consciousness.\nThe Mystery of Music\n\"The mystery of music is its power to speak to each one of us exactly what it is that he needs to hear, or else what it is that he doesn't even know he needs to hear.\" -- Havelock Ellis\nWhat is it that music does?

        "instruction": "What type of Rifle is an AK47?",
        "output": "What type of Rifle is an AK47?\nIt is a type of 7.6239mm rifle that is widely used by military and paramilitary forces. It has long been an iconic weapon to many people all around the world.\nWho made the world's second rifle?\nWho made the world's second rifle? The Mauser Gewehr 1888 is the world's second rifle. It is a bolt-action weapon. It is made in Bavaria, Germany.\nWhere do you get a 41 rifle?\nYou can only find rifles like these at gun shows by going to different dealers. They are also available online.\nWhat rifle can you buy for under 2000?\nRuger AR-556\nIs a 41 rifle cheaper?\nAs such, you might assume it costs more, but it is actually cheaper. Most people say it is, but there are cheaper ways to get a 45 Colt that also comes with better ammunition.\nWill an AK41 knock down a deer?\nAn AK-47 will knock down an adult deer, but only a large deer, with heavy chests. Small deer may not be knocked down with a single shot from a 30-round detachable magazine AK-47.\nHow do you load a m14 rifle?\nTo load your M14, insert your 10 round strip of ammunition into the chamber.\nWhat does it mean to be a rifleman?\nIn the Army, a rifleman is a combat arms soldier trained to use a small arm at hand-to-hand combat, who can perform a variety of tasks, including close combat, direct fire, sniper and reconnaissance, long range surveillance, close quarter battle, and dismounted, mounted, and aircraft operations.\nWhy are Marines called riflemen?\nFor the Marine who has taken this oath, \"fighting Marines\" is a designation that has its roots in the service's history. It dates back to when Marine Corps General Ambrose E. Burnside officially changed the title of its Marines from \"fusiliers\" to \"riflemen\" on December 8, 1866.\nWhat is a rifleman's pay?\nIf you are in the military, you can get about $20,000 to $30,000 a year for E-3 to E-7. Marines, as you can see, make less than Army personnel, especially when you combine the pay scale with the combat pay and the special duty status. The highest paid Marine is E-8, which is basically a company grade officer.\nHow do you clean a 41 rifle shell?\nIt takes a rifle to do it\nFirst, make sure no one is in the line of fire, then load a rifle with 41 caliber cartridges.\nPlace the rifle in a safe position, and fire the rifle until there are no rounds in the chamber and the empty magazine is cleared from the rifle.\nDo M16s hurt?\nThe M16 does not cause permanent damage to flesh. While the bullet does leave an exit and a permanent hole, the hole is a relatively small. The impact that produces this hole is also pretty non-lethal.\nHow to do a 41 caliber shotgun?\nTo do this method, you need to do the following steps :\nStep one : Take a 41 caliber cartridge.\nStep two : Open the receiver of your 41 caliber firearm.\nStep three : Use the cartridge to load the chamber with each round.\nTo make your shots more accurate and effective, you need to do these steps in order.\nWhat is a 45 shot rifle?\nThe 45 Magnum is one of the most powerful revolver or firearm cartridges ever developed.\nDo you keep your rifle locked?\nWhen you have more than one gun, it makes sense to keep certain firearms together to make it easier to remember where you left them and to keep all guns locked separately. The M1A and AK47 are ideal because they are locked separately to make sense. If you have your AR-15 unlocked, you should keep it alone.\nWhat rifle do Navy Seals use?\nThe Marine Corps and Navy have both adopted the M4 into service and the M27 into service.\nWhat is a pistol that fires 45 caliber?\nThe 45 Auto, also known as the 45 cartridge, is an American semi-automatic pistol cartridge and a common military. It was developed in the 1910s and is the pistol version of the . 45 cartridge case used by the 5-6.552mm (0.2184.739 in). Both are popular and effective in the civilian market."

        "instruction": "why the sky is blue?",
        "output": "why the sky is blue?” and “Why a flat Earth?” But they were always asking questions that had to do with something tangible. By 1882, a professor by the name of O.H. Taylor of the University of South Carolina would ask, “Why does my stomach grumble at the sight of roast mutton?”3 Taylor began the process of “dancing toward the unknown,” as one scholar put it.4\nThe next academic conference to tackle this issue was held nine years later, in 1891, in Athens, Ohio. A second one had been planned for the fall of 1892 at Yale University, but it fell through. By the end of the nineteenth century, there were a number of academic conferences focused on psychology, but what would come to be called the science of human nature was still something of a loose collection of interests.\nThat all began to change in 1900, when the American Psychological Association started to meet every year for national scientific conferences, although it was a loose collection then, as well, with conferences only sponsored by individual members. It would still be another decade before something called an “American Psychological Association” could be properly named. But if you’re wondering about the American Psychological Association Conference’s name, you can thank the University of Chicago professor Gordon Allport.\nGordon Allport\nAllport arrived at Chicago in 1904 and, over time, rose to become a nationally significant figure in the field. In the 1924 conference, he suggested — not very nicely, really — that academic conferences be called “American Psychological Association Meetings” instead of the far more elegant sounding “Conference of the American Psychical Association.” The APA started calling itself that in 1930.\nAllport also served as the organization’s fifth president, and helped to cement a number of things — including conferences taking place every year and the journal called Psychological Bulletin, which came out in 1912.\nAs for Gordon himself, he became an expert on prejudice and personality psychology, and wrote over a hundred books, journal papers, and other writings in his long career. He also coined terms like “interactionism,” and he is said to be the person who gave us the phrase “the Big Five personality traits.” As one psychologist later put it, one of history’s first big “experiments in social psychology” came during World War II when Allport was in charge of the “Psychological Warfare” division of the Manhattan Project.\nTo go through every meeting of the APA is way beyond the scope of this article, but you can read about the history here.\nThere’s actually a great section about the beginnings of APA conferences written by the APA’s own Dr. Mark T. Greenberg. That post begins:\nFrom those early meetings to the present, the conferences have moved from being primarily focused on clinical psychology to broadly including research on human behavior. Over time, they have developed into international meetings.\n“The APA’s annual conference attracts over 5000 professional presentations over five days, from hundreds of leading researchers from over 80 countries,” said Dr. Mark T. Greenberg, Director of the Division of Science of Learning and Development and Editor in Chief of the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology.\nThere are many great stories about the APA. Here’s one from 1912, about James McKeen Cattell.\nIt happened when he was talking at one of his annual meetings (that would be in 1912). There was a particularly interesting question about the different ways that the brain is affected by age. His answer is now considered one of the most famous lines in all of psychology — although it was apparently said as a joke. After discussing the research that indicated older people generally remembered fewer and fewer things, Cattell said, “Some of you know that the tendency to a decline in memory is an old one. It dates back to my earliest period as an experimentalist and was called at that period the phenomenon of forgetting.”\nThe point is that APA has been around now for 115 years. And over that long period of time, it has been an important organization for a number of reasons.\nThe first one would be the conference itself. APA events have traditionally been where researchers present their research and where people (mostly professionals at this point) come together to share ideas.\nNot only that, but APA is still pretty much in the business of promoting scientific psychology as a whole. One of the ways they do that is by giving out an annual award to the person who has done the most to further the field. The recipient is normally a living person, although the awards have been given posthumously a few times.\nThey have also published a popular and well-respected journal called, you guessed it, the Journal of Applied Developmental"

        "output": "Should I use the boiling water method or Ammonia fermentation to make dye out of mixed Hypogymnia lichen? How long will it soak in cold/boiling water?\nI see that you can use a boiling water bath for 30 min.\nI use both boiling water and fermentation, fermentation uses a smaller amount of water but it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or three weeks. That said, fermentation has less waste to deal with compared to regular soaking and it's more flexible, you can just toss the soaking water out instead of letting it sink out little by little. Additionally, fermentation usually produces a stronger colour but is less reliable.\nThanks for this post. I need to start making my own dyes and just bought a bunch of tannin from FSC. I know they sell some dyestuff as well, so I have a little money to spend on it next time. Is there anything else I can just extract from my backyard that's a dye?\nWhat if we just want a more subtle color?\nJust get some bromine and a few hours of sunshine if you want subtle. That will even give you some nice, saturated greens, and you'll have even less waste since you've already got your bromine.\nI was just going to post about the same thing; bromine works quite well. This is a good time to use it too; since you'll have to leave the fabric in it for awhile.\nHypogymnia lichen has been used as a blue dye for ages. I'm not familiar with the specific techniques for that, but the method for tannin dyes will work.\nMy first idea was bromine! But in addition to blue, it'll give you greens as well (which is what I most want). That is certainly more than a couple of hours in the summer sun, but it's not hard or long to get.\nI got some bromine from a store. A lot cheaper than buying tannin and I think it produces better colour than the tannin.\nIt may have to soak in a solution with bromine longer than the tannin if you want it to take much darker. It still washes out and the colour fades a bit over time but not as much as a tannin colour."

        "output": "Hello there Obi One Kenobi,\n\nI see you're very serious about your new career as a Star Wars action figure. And I'd like to be your new best friend and talk about those important matters (like space magic, princess battles, and, of course, the ways to get the most mileage out of your old Jedi costume).\n\nThe Force is strong in all who have visited the Star Wars toy shop at least once or more times than we can count, and a good deal have made a personal pilgrimage to the home of Chewbacca, Obi Wan Kenobi, and all their Star Wars buddies and neighbors in a galaxy far, far away. I, myself, have watched (and purchased) it all—the epic movies, the best TV specials, the beloved TV shows, and all those wonderful video games. We all know what these wonderful characters are made of and are no longer fooled, and so Star Wars has taken on a whole new meaning, a special place that isn't simply a galaxy filled with intergalactic aliens.\n\nNo, now it is an expression of how we, as a culture, have grown up and changed over the decades. Now it is our culture—and Star Wars is a good representative of that. As we all know by now, Star Wars is nothing more than a series of blockbusters, but there's more to it. The series includes a whole family of characters, so one generation can give the Star Wars series to the next. That being said, the series is a good example of everything that a movie/entertainment/culture should be. It's a story. A real life story. You grow up with them, and then you pass them on to your own children.\n\nI must tell you that my family loves the Star Wars series as much as I do. My wife was so excited by the series when I first brought it into our home, which is when we created our own family unit. Not only was she ecstatic but also our son and daughter are part of the family, and have grown up with Star Wars on both VHS and DVD. Now, she is even more delighted because our eldest daughter has become an actress and recently had a leading role in a Star Wars movie. Talk about a double whammy!\n\nMy son and daughter loved all the movies, and they were eager to watch each movie in sequence. Over the years, they learned the names of all the characters and their individual relationships, and even began to ask me to tell stories about the special things in each movie. For us, Star Wars became our own personal fantasy world, and we even kept our own Star Wars calendar. We'd look forward to what would happen in the next movie, and try to guess some of the stories that might happen in the Star Wars series, as well as in the other Star Trek series on the big and small screen.\n\nIn fact, our son, Christopher, had made up a few of his own stories about all his favorite characters . . . including Darth Vader.\n\n\"I heard Darth Vader is being chased by some bounty hunters,\" he said. And then he would add with a lot of excitement—\"and he's got to hide out in his old garage!\"\n\nOur son is a very keen reader, and as such has an active imagination, and also enjoys telling his own stories of the characters we know so well. In fact, they are better stories than those we might read or watch on television, for they are original and more interesting and detailed. In this book, there will be a few simple ideas and tips on how to incorporate these wonderful memories, as well as the original Star Wars action figures that we know and love.\n\nThere is a lot of space in this galaxy, and a lot of planets just begging for new adventures. And in the pages ahead, you will learn how to build even more awesome characters such as Bobbie Dread and her sidekick, Rattus. You will learn how to build the most awesome, powerful characters such as Lord Vader himself, the most powerful and dangerous man in the whole of the galaxy far, far away.\n\nYou will learn how to make some of the coolest accessories that anyone could ever imagine, and how to turn your own kitchen into Star Wars' greatest space-age kitchen. In fact, you can build such a cool-looking kitchen that you might want to open it to the public, and make a fortune.\n\nIn short, I promise this book is going to show you how to take your toy-building skills to new heights. I know that my family are just going to love this book, and as you build your collection of characters and accessories, we're sure that you are going to be amazed when you find out that you too can create a whole new fantasy world of Star Wars characters.\n\nOkay, Obi, take it away"

        "output": "what is the Infinite banking concept?\nWhat is the \"infinite banking concept?\" You are probably asking me that as a question, so let me ask you as well: What is money?\nWhat makes something money?\nYou don't care, you want to know what the \"infinite banking concept\" is. Well what is money then? Well money has to have a value...\nWhat makes something have value?\nHere is a good description:\n\"a system of exchange and a medium of exchange which is generally accepted by the parties engaged in the transaction for the mutual satisfaction of the parties to the barter or exchange.\nIn modern times, the dominant form of money has been either precious metal (gold and silver) in the form of coins or paper money issued by a central bank and backed by the sovereign government. (Wikipedia)\"\nWhat exactly is your money and how can it be replaced by \"money\" in your bank account?\nLet's start by answering this: It is a \"thing.\" It is a \"thing\", but it is just a unit of accounting that you keep track of on paper in your bank or in your personal accounting books.\nIs money a tangible thing or an accounting thing?\nIt is an accounting thing...a number in your checking account and a number on your credit card.\nWhat is an accounting number?\nAn accounting number is an \"amalgamation.\" It is the sum and the aggregate of many actual, tangible, or even \"human\" things. But what is a thing? A thing is anything that has a finite quantity, a finite substance, or a finite quantity of time. Anything. It is always one of the following:\na) tangible\nb) abstract\nc) spiritual\nEach and every thing has a finite quantity, a finite substance, or a finite time. That which is \"in-finite\" is never one of the above. That which is \"in-finite\" is just a \"thought.\" And that is precisely why one \"in-finite thing\" is just an \"abstract notion.\"\nMoney is a measurement of time.\nMoney is time. Money is a way you measure or track \"time\" in your financial world. So, \"money\" is a \"way to measure or track time\" and it is a \"way to hold and track it.\"\nYou think that \"money\" is the \"value.\" Is money a monetary measure of value? Or is money a monetary measurement of time? You may wonder: \"What is the difference?\"\nI use this example on most of my clients to drive this point home:\nIf someone offered you a one-dollar bill for an hour of work to do for you: I would ask that person what is a dollar. And the answer will be that it is a measurement of time. It is that much time that you give in exchange for that one hour of work.\nHow much time is that one hour of work?\nHow are you going to use that one hour of work? Is it a way to get a \"lot of money?\"\nIs the \"lot of money\" what you are going to get for the one-hour work?\nIs not time the one thing you can not give back? Is not time the one thing you have to \"pay for\" if you want to work for your living?\nAnd what do you \"value\" the most in your life?\nMoney is not \"value.\" Value is only in time. Money is only a measurement of time. That is pretty much all it is.\nSo, back to the first question you posed: What is the \"infinite banking concept?\"\nI will answer that above:\nWhat is \"Money\" in your checking account?\nIt is an amalgamation of a number on your credit cards, it is an amalgamation of a line item on your bank statement, in your checking account and in your mortgage, car, or other loan account.\nWhat is Money on your credit cards?\nIt is a credit line that you can only use with the full knowledge that you have to pay it back with an \"interest\" payment.\nWhat is money? It is your money. You do not own it and the bank does not own it. Who owns money?\nYou create money. You create money from nothing. You create money by just putting something in your pocket and something on your checkbook.\nSo to answer that first question: What is the \"infinite banking concept?\" The infinite banking concept is that you spend money that you have ALREADY made. When you spend your money, you create money again, but this time you give it to someone who needs your money and in exchange ask \"less money\" in exchange.\nThis is a very, very, fundamental concept but also very, very, fundamental to our society.\nWhen it comes to money and the infinite"

These are summarised below.\nIn addition to watching her fat consumption and carbohydrate intake, Laura also had a few other dietary changes that helped her drop two dress sizes. She reduced the amount of sugar in the household, limited sweets, and stopped grabbing snacks at her sons' hockey games.\nThe first 3 changes to my diet\nâThe first three changes to my diet were all about the fats I added in,â says Laura. âI started eating more healthy fats, like olive oil. â¦ I limited my omega-6 fats, like vegetable oils. I also reduced the amount of butter I ate.â\nâThe first change to my diet was eating more healthy fats. I ate 2% Greek yogurt with a scoop of peanut butter instead of the fat-free, zero-calorie alternatives. And I reduced the amount of sugar in the house so I wasnât tempted by a box of cookies. I also put some honey on the table for people to use when they want a sweet treat.â She added that she stopped eating sweets, like those at the hockey games, with the intention of âbreaking the addictive brain behaviourâ.\nThe second 2 changes to my diet\nâThe second two changes to my diet were both about the carbohydrates I ate. I cut out refined carbs,â said Laura. âI started adding low-carb vegetables to a salad, and limiting the amount of carbohydrates in our food â like limiting pasta and other carbs in the house.â\nâI changed the way I used carbs, so I ate more healthy whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, beans, and lentils.â\nâI was the one who cooked the meals so I had to learn new ways to cook with what was in the house.â Laura decided to eat a low-carbohydrate diet by reducing sugar, starch, and refined grains in her diet, while increasing vegetable and protein content.\nLaura also focused on adding more vegetables and fruit to her diet, and this was a major component of her success.\nâI found that my taste buds adjusted and now vegetables taste so good!â Laura added that she increased her portions of low-carb vegetables, such as cauliflower, broccoli, and a whole range of green vegetables. She also tried eating more fruit such as peaches, pineapple, watermelon, and blueberries.\nThe third 4 changes to my diet\nâThe third four changes to my diet were what I call âthe no-nosâ,â said Laura. âI limited fat consumption, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine.â\nâWhen I first started out I was drinking a glass of wine or champagne for dinner every night of the week, and then in the evenings I'd pop to the shop and do a mini-shop for chocolate, biscuits, ice-cream, etc. I had to stop doing all that.â She added that she also started to watch her alcohol consumption. She decided that she was going to use champagne and wine as her celebrations drink only, and that alcohol would not play a role in her social life any more.\nâI was also limiting my caffeine too â coffee, sodas and iced teas.â\nIt sounds like Lauraâs first four steps to success came from cutting down the fat, refined carbohydrates, sugar, caffeine, and alcohol in her diet. But what about her other recommendations?\nThe last 4 recommendations\nâI increased my water intake,â says Laura. âBut I also increased my intake of tea and coffee, which Iâve been drinking for over 30 years. So I didnât want to stop drinking coffee, and I didnât want to reduce my water intake.â\nLaura also learned to listen to her body when she sat down to her next meal. During her first weeks of dieting she would just be hungry so she would eat whatever was next to her.\nâNow I ask myself the three Bâs: am I burning up energy, am I burning fat, or am I just eating because Iâm bored? Then I decide whether I should eat. If"

        "output": "Where does pornography come from? Pornography is a very popular and big business everywhere. Pornography is now part of the mainstream culture. Pornography as an industry is becoming increasingly more mainstream in American society as time goes on, especially with the Internet. There are many people that have an interest in pornography for different reasons. Pornography is also the oldest profession, the oldest industry in the world.[citation needed] Pornography has been around for thousands of years.[citation needed]\nIn the United Kingdom, where the production and distribution industry for pornography has no restrictions, the 1984 Video Recordings Act[58] prohibits the supply and possession of pornographic material deemed to contain acts which \"lack any serious literary, scientific, or other value\" (whether or not their sole or main purpose is gratification of sexual desire). The British equivalent to the USA's federal obscenity statute[59] prohibits the creation and distribution of pornography which \"tends so to arouse the passions, and produce lustful thoughts\" in the viewer as to reduce the person to sexual submission.[60]\nPornography and social issues\nA study by Dr. Dolf Zillman, entitled Watching Pornography: The Viewer, The Video and The Victims, has found that 6% of men watched pornographic videos for 70% of their leisure time. 12% of women spend 30% of their leisure time watching pornography. The percentage of time spent engaged in sexual activities in pornography have shown to be on the average 200% higher than in their own personal lives on couples.[61] This leads researchers to believe that the viewing of pornography leads to an increase in the frequency of their sexual practices outside of the relationship.\nAccording to a 2007 analysis of the U.S. Consumer Expenditures, data for 2004, pornography was the most expensive of the 321 goods and services and the 10th highest expenditure in the household sector.[62][63]\nIn 2007, a study of 500 college students was conducted in England and Northern Ireland. The study concluded that more pornography consumption by heterosexual males results in greater increases in depression, anxiety, and anger among their heterosexual female partners.[64]\nIn 2006 research showed that young men who have access to internet pornographic images often find them not only exciting and amusing, but also empowering.[54]\nA study done in 2008 at McMaster University, Ontario Canada, and Harvard University, found a relationship between heavy pornography usage and a 20% increase in male sexually transmitted infections.[65]\nPornography and violence against women\nMain article: Violence against women\nA 1999 Australian study showed that one-fifth to one-third of women and men in a sample of women and men had experienced rape or attempted rape, one in eight women had experienced a severe act of forced sexual intercourse. This figure increased to one in five women among women who had been exposed to pornography, especially violent pornography, suggesting that pornography may be used to prepare victims, especially young women, for sexual violence.[66] The use of pornography may also increase sexual aggression against children.[67]\nThe National Coalition Against Pornography (NCAP) has stated that pornography objectifies women, reduces them to sexual objects and has contributed to prostitution and the coerced prostitution of children.[68]\nAmerican psychiatrist Judith Reisman has been writing and speaking about the harm of pornography and pornography-related child pornography since 1980.[69]\nIn an October 2003 address in Australia, President Bush said, \"I call on the people of Europe to stand against the dangers in the pornographic television that flows freely into the homes of Europe.\" The European Parliament strongly supports artistic and freedom of expression in the media, saying, \"[the European Union's] culture ... is deeply influenced by and indolent to, the free flow of artistic and creative works and values that result from it.\"[70]\nA 1973 United States Supreme Court ruling in Miller v. California held that obscenity (and thus pornography) is not protected by the First Amendment. However, the court held in its same-year ruling in New York v. Ferber that child pornography is not protected by the First Amendment. The court stated that it is unaffected by the definition of what constitutes child pornography used in common, and that the court's definitions must include \"that which is the product of any photograph, videotape, motion picture, or any record, device, or edited materials.\" In U.S. v. Oreck-Bullock in 1994, the Court held"

        "output": "Hi, can you tell me a story in a novel format including dialogs between the characters, a story based on the Justice League comics, including the characters, Green Arrow, Red Arrow and Cheshire. The story would be in a novel format but it is NOT a sequel to the Justice League comics. Thankyou, and please let me know when you can.\nThe JLU team met a man named K'onel on an outpost. They learned that K'onel's world has been overrun by a race called Kromaggs. They asked him to come with them to see Justice League International.\nJustice League International was not around back then, and so K'onel decided to return to his planet. However, they decided to do some space exploring and so saw an asteroid with a planet trapped in it. K'onel and his friend were trapped as well. As they struggled they discovered a green flame and were able to use it to get to a Kromagg ship. And then they teleported to an alien ship.\nOnce they landed, Cheshire was very curious as to who these people were. They decided to go to find Superman and the other Justice League members. That way they could tell everyone that the Kromaggs were attacking.\nOnce they made contact with the Justice League International and had explained everything, Green Arrow asked for Cheshire and went on a mission with her.\nRed Arrow was on an island trying to find an egg.\nHe saw a woman who told him to give her his watch for the egg. Instead of giving it to her, he said that he had met a group of people who would take over the world if it were possible. He was sent to a room where his sister was being held by a Kromagg. He knew that Kromaggs were not people and decided to kill the aliens one at a time. After a while, she left him and he continued to kill them.\nWhen he was about done, he went back to Red Arrow. After explaining everything to him, he said that he wasn't ready to leave.\nBack in the ship, K'onel met a woman who had been on his planet when the Kromaggs had invaded. Unfortunately, she had been injured and couldn't fight with them any more. And she explained that there was a group of resistance members called the Green Lantern Corps who could help the Kromaggs.\nGreen Arrow told everyone he had met Cheshire and learned about how people can learn how to become Green Lanterns.\nBack on Earth, Red Arrow had given away the only green lantern ring to a little girl.\nWhen their ship came to a new planet, they came across people who were looking at the Green Arrow. They were upset that so many people had been killed in his world. A man tried to stop Batman but he did not. So Batman was ready to fight him and they began.\nThey continued fighting until they heard a noise which distracted them. The group then decided to go home.\nBack on K'onel world, they began learning everything about the man he was looking for, Green Lantern.\nBack on Earth, K'onel and Batman traveled to the headquarters of the Justice League.\nJustice League International met them and found out that K'onel's world was destroyed.\nWith the help of Batman, they were able to defeat the Green Lantern. After that they continued learning more about K'onel's world.\nThen they turned the ship around and head to the planet they saw. However, they came across a race of Kromaggs and learned about the people who destroyed K'onel's world.\nAt the same time, Cheshire had learned the truth about one of the other Kromaggs. And she and Green Arrow did battle and lost against Kromaggs. But Cheshire came up with a plan and then learned the truth about Kromaggs. As they learned this, Green Arrow realized that there could be hope for K'onel to be a hero again.\nAs they talked about what had happened, K'onel remembered that his father was not as evil as people had believed. And he realized the truth about aliens and humans. After that, everyone went home and lived happily ever after.\nI'm not sure what you're looking for. I wrote a story like that about The Flash's first mission in the Justice League. http://dcanswers.com/faq/show/877631-will-the-justice-league-makes-its-first-public-appearance-on-tv\nI don't know if it'll answer all of your questions since it's from season 3.\n@RJ White I really like it! Thanks so much!\nThis is in reference to my story and a plot I've been trying to work out for a little while"

        "output": "How do I check my system drive for errors on Windows?\nFirst, go to Control Panel in Windows 10. Then use the Search bar (at the top of the page, to the right of the Search box) to find File Explorer. Then select \"This PC\". Finally, select the system drive, such as C:. Windows will display a screen with the drive name. You can then press the “Disk Cleanup” menu item, a new screen should open. On this screen you can select, from a drop down list, the type of check you would like to run, then you can choose either Full or Quick.\nWhat is the difference between Full and Quick?\nFull: The full scan runs through your drives completely. If there are bad sectors in your disk, they are fixed.\nQuick: The quick scan looks for problems but does not fix them. This is because the disk has a problem with one or more bad sectors. If found, it will repair them and you will be able to use your disk.\nNote: You need to make sure that you use a disk with a good sector to do the repair.\nWhy do I still have errors on my system drive after all the time and effort put into running the disk check?\nYour system drive could have bad sectors. If, after you have run the disk check properly, your system drive still shows that it has problems, then you need to move your system drive to a new disk.\nI’ve run the check and I don’t see any errors on the screen that popped up. Should I move to a new disk?\nPossibly, but more likely, no. Not everything is shown on this screen. It is, in fact, only showing the problems that are big enough to cause your computer to slow down, crash, or other symptoms. If there are still errors on this disk and there are no symptoms, then you should continue using it, but if you would like a new disk, you can do that next, but be sure to back up your system drive before doing this."

With zip, my function call takes around 500ms and 600ms. Can I make my zip function faster with another way? If not, is there anything else that can help improving my performance?\nI want to increase the performance so that I can run my code faster in the real project I'm trying to do. I do not want to create another function that will return the two elements, I want to know how to do it better. I do not want to use cpu-intensive things, using 1/th of the cpu is ok. I found this site\nbut I don't understand what I'm reading and how can I make my function faster.\n\nA: You're missing the point of zip.  It only takes the nth tuple from the source list.  If your source list has N values, with n % N being the true index, and you only want to read the first n/2 elements, then you could iterate over the source list twice.  First, iterate using a while loop and index n so you can pop the first n/2-element tuples from the list:\n    def first(i, file_data):\n        for i in range(0, len(file_data)//2):\n            first.append(file_data[i])\n\n    def second(i, file_data):\n        for i in range(len(file_data)//2, len(file_data)):\n            second.append(file_data[i])\n\nThat should go much, much faster."

        "instruction": "What is the meaning of life?",
        "output": "What is the meaning of life?\"\n\nAs if that is an answer easily found. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to such a question. Just as the answers you get to the question, \"What is the meaning of music?\" are as varied as the music itself. It depends on who asks and why. It depends on personal circumstances. It depends on political upheaval, social upheaval, scientific developments or lack of them. On so many levels and beyond the scope of this essay.\n\nBut the answer is also very simple—or so it seems to me. It is so very similar to a question we've all heard many times: What is art for? \"To change our souls.\" What is the meaning of art? \"To ennoble our souls.\" What is the meaning of music? To express the inexpressible. That is what many composers and music lovers say. \"To put words into music.\" I have heard it said, \"To give words a back and wings.\"\n\nThis is all true, of course, but the most important thing for all of us is that we have to experience the meaning through our own emotions and feelings. In my view, music is best used by you and only by you, as each of us is unique, and there can be no universal answer for everyone. Even if we take the \"meaning of music\" from a composer, it is that piece of music that is really important. It comes from the composer. But it is played by you, so it must be yours. And through it, you should be able to reach your own personal meaning for music, art, or even life in a general way.\n\nTo me, music is a tool for growth, both as a musician and as an individual. It is best to think and act in that specific way. Music is a tool that we all use and it can best be used as a part of life, to create a fulfilling and exciting life with all the colors and emotions that life has to offer.\n\nNow, more than ever, music can give meaning to people. In troubled times, music is more important than ever before, and we should give music the attention it deserves.\n\nSo yes, I believe that music has a great significance, but it is only as great as you let it be. It is you and your interpretation of what is happening, of what you experience. And that is the real meaning of music—or of any kind of expression.\n\nIf we allow music to influence not only our feelings but our actions as well, we will be much stronger and healthier people. That is the greatest gift music has to give us all, including our young musicians.\n\n[**\"We are all the same.\"**](002_Contents.html#ch7_5)\n\n######\n\nWe are very lucky to be a part of this orchestra, to be with musicians of such a high standard. We all play the same instrument—the violin. But on the way we have learned to approach this instrument in different ways. Sometimes you get ideas for music only when you play with musicians outside your own circle and they use musical languages you are not used to playing with. For instance, the Dutch violinist Erik Tulp said something about my playing: \"It is like a Dutchman playing Russian music.\"\n\nI have heard that all you have to do is \"find a better violin and become more experienced.\" For many of us, the violin is more than just a violin, it is a part of ourselves, and it takes a lot to learn how to play an instrument that has that sort of significance, that can give you so much in return. But it is not always easy. What kind of thoughts go through your head when you approach the violin? Do they cause you to play differently? Have they influenced your way of approaching music? Or did you know you were playing the violin—or have any other instrument—all along and that's why you play as you do?\n\nIn that way, I have my own way of doing things. When I start something, I do not usually listen to music. But I listen to something else. In my case, a sound. Just one sound. And when I listen to it, I can hear the same sound in the notes I play as the sound I was listening to. I think I have always had this way of doing things.\n\nI have always had a deep interest in making music. But I have never tried to force it. I have always tried to accept the way it came to me, like when I played in school, or made up my own instruments and wrote music by feel.\n\nWhen I talk about the development of a violinist, we talk about technique. But the truth is that technique only plays a small part in being a great musician. It is more about being able to hear the music"

        "output": "In minecraft, what are the best ways to farm experience quickly? Name pros and cons. I was playing Survival with my friend and he wanted to level up instantly. How can we do that?\nExperience-wise:\nThe easiest way is to fight monsters in the cave to mine ores, and then to use the furnace. There are monsters everywhere from easy level 10 to 3* harder. Some of them drop valuable ores, and that can be sold to get 5000-10000 experience per time.\nThe second way is to mine gold bars (or emerald to a lesser extent) to grind into items: pickaxe, axe, iron sword, or diamond pickaxe. One bar turns into 3 experience.\nThe third way is to mine iron, and use it to make a sword.\nThe fourth way is to kill chickens to farm eggs, and use the egg to make bacon (35 experience per batch), or make bacon sandwiches with bread to gain another 35 experience. Egg can also be used to bake bread, and then the bread is used to brew ale (400 experience gained per batch).\nThe last way is to grind out a lot of ores and forge metal to make iron, or better quality items with enchants applied on them. The most effective item is iron armor with fire protection (+2 enchants), so you only need at most 10 iron ingots to make some of those.\nEasiest way is to spawn gold and spawners and wait to farm experience and gold. Don't forget to destroy all the spawners after you have enough gold.\nThere are many ways to gain experience, and there is no wrong way (except perhaps a way where experience is wasted on farming)\n\nFor gold farming\nFor gold farming, it is as simple as spawning a bunch of gold miners and just spawning until they get enough gold. There are a few ways to do this, but it's mainly just by finding a pool of gold ore, or putting a bunch of spawners in a cave so it's all gold.\nOnce there is one, continue to place a second spawner in another part of the cave, then a third, and so on. Once there is a stack of about 20, it will be quick to get plenty of gold, then once you have enough, just destroy the spawners and you've got gold to sell.\nGold can easily be turned into a huge pile of gold bars, which can be sold anywhere. Even a single gold bar gives about 500 experience, so you can make it quickly.\n\nA: If you have a few players on your server that are around lv. 99 -- maybe use the enchantment of 'Drain Life' on enchanted swords.\nWhen your player hits an enemy, the enemy will take some of your blood life and share it with them in a drop of life.\nIf you have enough enemy monsters you can make a stack of drops of life, and sell those drops.\nThen use the money you got from your drops to make more drops and get more experience. \n\nA: If you're playing Minecraft in a 1.8+ server, you can buy and sell Experience Orbs that can be sold / bought through the shop. You can get 255xp for an orb of pure xp (45xp), and it is quite cheap. While you can use this method in a survival world, it is a very time consuming way to farm experience (especially with a server populated with people who are not players but administrators, so you can't buy the orbs off them).\n\nA: The easiest way to farm experience in the world of Survival and Adventurer, is to mine Iron or Gold and use it to build a pickaxe, which then unskilled you 185 skill points for each successful hit, and once that pickaxe is used 10 times it will break, this is when you use those resources again, but this time to build a sword, which you will have to repair as well, now there are a few ways to farm experience\n\n\n*\n\n*Mining.\n\n*Killing enemies\n\n*Farming\n\n*Buying exp\n\n*Eating bacon\n\n*Eating chicken\n\n\nThere are plenty of ways to farm experience, such as the ways mentioned above.\nKilling monsters like zombies & skeletons give you 100 experience points.\nMining (any material) give you a 75  10 points per successful hit.\nFarming (any material) give you 100 points per successful farm.\nNow the best way to farm experience is to have 1  stack of 54 - "

        "output": "In TypeScript, how can I tell the type system \"I know that in theory this value may have these multiple types, but in practice I know it will only have this one\" so I can cast it to a single concrete type?\n\nA: What you're looking for is Type Guarding.  A common idiom for this is to use a union type and match on the type's properties to determine the appropriate behaviour.  For example if your value is a MyType.MySubType value you can do the following:\nclass MyType\n{\n    public MySubType: string;\n}\n\n\nclass MyTypeClass\n{\n    public myType: MyType;\n\n    private get myTypeClassType(): MySubType\n    {\n        return this.myType as MySubType;\n    }\n}\n\nvar myClass: MyTypeClass = { myType: { MySubType: \"something\" } };\nmyClass.myTypeClassType;\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\nA: In general, this is not possible.  Cast is the type system's way of saying \"I trust you\".  If you're not confident about the value, don't cast it.  (One exception to this might be union types.  If a type defines a different subtype for each field, you could define different methods that handle each of them.)\n\nA: Type casts have to happen at compile time. So it's not possible to prevent type errors from happening. It's also not possible to check every time the method that you're calling needs something that it can handle, when it can handle it. If, for example, you change from MyType.MySubType to MyDifferentType, you won't have checked for that, and if you use that method with the new value, you'll get a TypeError.\nThere is, however, a way to avoid that error 100% of the time: if you know that the only type in MyType that has MySubType, don't bother with anything but MyType.MySubType. If you don't care how exactly the value is cast from MyType to something more specific (e.g. MyType.MySubType is a string, and MyType.SomethingElse is a number), don't cast, don't check if you want to call that method.\nSo in short: there is no easy way to check that a cast is going to succeed."

        "instruction": "is javascript back end or front end language?",
        "output": "is javascript back end or front end language? JavaScript has the most flexibility to handle multiple types of programming languages. Its ability to be interpreted as well as compiled make it suitable for most applications.\nJavaScript language was created by Brendan Eich to solve some problems that were arising with Java. It was written in May 10, 1995 to solve the problem of dynamic content for the Netscape browser. It was released on Netscape Navigator 1.0 in December 1, 1995.\nJavaScript has a lot to offer to websites today including: JQuery, JSON, RxJs, Angular, Typescript, .Net and ReactJs.\nWhy JavaScript is so used?\nJavaScript was created to be a dynamic object oriented language for the internet. It was designed to be used on web browsers. Therefore, it is widely used due to the number of users of the web.\nIn addition, JavaScript is relatively easier to understand compared to other more complex languages. This also makes it one of the most used languages today. While other languages are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to use, JavaScript has still managed to rise and remain at the top to serve all the web. This makes JavaScript better to work on in comparison to others.\nWhat does JavaScript do?\nThis is a common question raised by learners of JavaScript. JavaScript has a lot of uses on the internet which includes the following:\nIt is used to render HTML elements including form components that interact with users. Thus, the pages written in JavaScript can communicate better with users.\nWeb Pages containing JavaScript also have better performance. This also makes navigation across web pages faster.\nJavaScript is also used for other more complex tasks such as making interactive forms, games and content for web pages.\nHow do I learn JavaScript?\nLearning JavaScript is easier these days due to the increase in learning tools and content on the internet. It can be said that learning JavaScript is much easier today compared to its previous years. Learners can easily access online courses and materials through free or paid courses.\nWeb Development with JavaScript is also an option that allows a learner to develop websites with the help of professional programmers who can guide and teach you through the process of learning it.\nThe steps to learn of course include:\nReading the book of the JavaScript, which is a manual designed for beginners\nTaking a free-online class\nReading material like blogs and videos\nTrying to practice and create your own website\nThese are tips that one can use to start learning JavaScript.\nDoes JavaScript support Object Oriented programming?\nYes, JavaScript supports Object Oriented programming. It is one of the things that makes JavaScript popular.\nJavaScript is a language that is easy to learn and can also support development of objects as well. As already discussed, JavaScript was originally designed to support interactive web pages. Today, it is also widely used to support object-oriented programming by adding the Object Orient functionality on it.\nWhy JavaScript is used in programming?\nThere are many reasons why you should use JavaScript programming software. Some of these benefits are as follows:\nIt is much easier to work on JavaScript if you learn to work on it. It is free to use and can be downloaded on web browsers. It is also the easiest language to understand for web programming. This makes it an ideal language to use for web development.\nJavaScript is widely used as one of the most popular programming languages out there today. As such, it has a number of other web languages to support. This means that you can also use other languages with it such as RxJs. With JavaScript, you can use it to work on many different web pages and make any web application possible.\nCan you learn JavaScript in a day?\nYou can learn JavaScript in a day. It only takes a few clicks on your keyboard to start working on programs. At the same time, this will be an easy task once you start learning about it. So, you can easily learn to use it in as few as a couple of hours or a day.\nHow many lines of code are there in JavaScript?\nIt depends on the number of lines of code you want to create. The general consensus is that there are 300 lines of code that can be used on any project that is made out of it.\nHow hard is JavaScript to learn?\nIn all honesty, JavaScript can be quite confusing to learn. It would not be easy to learn in a day as it has more to it that you would expect. However, it has a number of benefits to work on in comparison to other programming languages.\nWhat are the different JavaScript languages?\nThere are many types of JavaScript languages for you to use. Some of these JavaScripts are as follows:\nWhat is JavaScript language?"

The way this text was generated, or any other similar article, is by an algorithm of words (usually with a pre-defined vocabulary), which learns from its own and human-written data. But these algorithms can be very complex, because they also have to learn the rules of natural language, which is a big obstacle as they have to make a lot of assumptions in order to make sense.\nBut since this is an algorithm only capable of processing sentences, it will be difficult for it to understand concepts as these would require a much more complex way of handling sentences, and there might not even be a concept to make use of in the first place.\n\nA: \nHow can I use text generation models like GPT-3 to produce high-quality sentences?\n\nThe first thing you should know is that GPT-3 might not be able to produce the text you described.\n\nHigh-quality sentences\n\nThat's actually a difficult definition to evaluate. On the one hand there are some models like GPT-3 that generate really good results, on the other hand, there are also models that generates text that's actually hard to accept. But then, GPT-3 as well has its drawbacks, so there is no guarantee to be satisfied with it's outcome.\nOn the other hand, there are some common tools to get an idea how good the result will be.\n\n*\n\n*If there's a training dataset that's used to train the model, you can look on the examples in that dataset and check if the example you're interested in (the sentence that you're trying to generate for GPT-3) appears in that dataset. If it does, you can assume a really good generation (it's likely coming from the training data set).\n\n*If the training dataset isn't public, you can try to request an example from the GPT-3 model.\n\n*Additionally to these 2 points, since GPT-3 is a language understanding model, you might also see how well it explains the input and the output. For example, when you request an example that was generated by GPT-3.\n\n*Last but not least, there is a large online database of people that ask GPT-3 and you can try to check the answer from that crowd as well."

These tasks are broadly representative of the kinds of tasks we ask our model today. So, these are the kinds of things it might do if you have it, and these are the kinds of things we expect to see it do in the future.\nTo be clear, we’re not saying that the way we train language models today is necessarily the best way. Language models still have many limitations, and these limitations could be lessened by other ways of training language models or new models entirely.\nWe believe that the power of language models is the product of a broad research effort across large language modeling, conversational learning, large-scale corpus building, infrastructure, and even human-in-the-loop techniques. We are continuing to build on this foundation and explore new techniques.\nHowever, we believe that open-source large-scale language models can serve as a catalyst for the larger community, to support research on the entire research continuum and to provide an experiment platform that can make the entire field more efficient.\nWhat is the open-source model?\nWe are developing a community-focused product, GPT-NEO, which will contain a subset of our open-source code, a copy of the HuggingFace Transformers library and model code, and a trained model. This product will be available to the public in the coming months. The primary advantage of this product, and the reason we made it available today, is that all features are free for non-commercial use and require no authorization and no payment. Additionally, GPT-NEO can be deployed on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS), without special permission, and is compatible with most existing applications.\nWhat is the timeline for open-source code release?\nToday, we are releasing the code for the first iteration of open-source models, including two model variants and an auxiliary inference toolkit. This code is available for download at the OpenAI repository.\nWe will release additional models in the near future. Specifically, we are already working on version 3.0 and are exploring additional model sizes and additional open-source variants. We will also continue on several fronts to work on models that we believe can offer a compelling alternative to what we have today.

        "output": "What are the main methods used by car manufacturers to reduce emissions in their ICE cars besides trying to lower the amount of fuel the engine uses?\nThe answer is to install new catalytic converters.\nIn the last few years, manufacturers have started taking advantage of the catalytic converter technology to reduce emissions in their cars.\nThis technology removes the harmful pollutants and toxic gasses that are a result of combustion.\nThe introduction of new catalytic converters on older ICE models has reduced the harmful emissions dramatically.\nIn addition, the new catalytic converters are also reducing the amount of emissions that come out of your tailpipe and are making your car more eco friendly.\nThe car manufacturer Honda has used catalytic converters in its combustion engines.\nIn fact, these new catalytic converters are so effective that cars such as the CRF450R can emit only half the amount of pollution.\nThe company also has a program where it installs new catalytic converters in the vehicles when they are being manufactured.\nWith this, it reduces the amount of toxic pollution produced by ICEs and thereby reducing the harmful impact to the environment.\nHere’s an interesting fact about catalytic converters, when they are inoperative, their emission is so small that it is barely detectable by the human eye.\nWhat exactly is a catalytic converter?\nA catalytic converter is a piece of solid metal that is placed in the exhaust system to capture and convert the exhaust gases and harmful particulates from the engine to a harmless gas.\nThese catalytic converters need to be placed where the exhaust gases are coming along with a temperature of about 1500°F to 2000°F.\nThe catalyst for converting the pollution is a catalyst that is made up of a metal, usually Pt and Rh, which is coated with a ceramic material.\nThis ceramic material is basically a ceramic coating that can absorb the harmful emissions coming from the exhaust system.\nOne example of a catalytic converter is the one installed in the CR-F450R.\nThe Honda CR-F450R has installed this type of catalytics into its 2-stroke engine.\nThe CR-F comes with a two-stroke engine that is fueled by methanol instead of gasoline and runs on a fuel mix consisting mostly of methanol.\nAs a result, it creates a lot more hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust.\nThis type of catalytic converter has a more complicated structure which makes it more expensive to manufacture.\nThe main purpose of installing this catalytic converter is to remove the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from your exhaust gas and produce new ones for the gasoline-powered engine.\nThe exhaust from the 2-stroke engine is made up of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons like CO and C-x.\nBy adding these catalysts or additives, it reduces the hydrocarbon content in the exhaust and reduces the amount of hydrocarbons being emitted from the tailpipe.\nThe most common catalytic converter is the ceramic-based catalytic converter that is used in the gasoline engine.\nAs mentioned before, this type is made up of a thin layer of a ceramic coating that is coated with metal.\nCarbon monoxide and carbon dioxide absorb the carbon monoxide in your carbon dioxide (CO) and use it to form water.\nThis process is also called a catalytic process where the CO and C-x are converted to a carbon dioxide.\nThe carbon dioxide is also absorbed by the gas-powered engine to form a carbon dioxide molecule that is then converted to a hydrocarbon.\nThe final step is to convert the CO to a carbon monoxides molecules which is formed from carbon monic acids and water.\nWhen this catalyzed process is carried out continuously, it helps to reduce the emissions from your gasoline engine.\nWhat Are Exhaust Catalysts?\nIf you are a car mechanic, chances are you are familiar with the various types of exhaust filters that are used in the exhaust systems.\nThe most common one is the catalytic converter.\nThese are made up from either a ceramic or metal or both.\nThey work by absorbing the pollutants coming from the engine and converting them into carbon dioxide gas.\nThis gas is then released into the air.\nThese types of exhausts are not only used in gasoline-powered engines but is also used for electric, natural gas, and diesel engines.\nIn the past, these types were mostly used as a way to improve the performance of the car, but today, they have become an important part of the vehicle’s exhaust system.\nIf you have a diesel car or an electric car, you can install a catalytic converter into the exhaust pipe.\nThis is because the exhaust gases are generated from the engine and contain harmful particles like carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and various other harmful gases.\nThe carbon dioxide produced"

I recently came across a review which seemed to think the author was very arrogant and pretentious.  On the other hand, you may find this review (by a man named Nassim Taleb) somewhat useful.  I would not take their word as gospel, but they do seem to have done a lot of reading.\nFooled by Randomness is a book primarily about finance, and the issues it deals with often are quite relevant to finance.  However, it is a book that is written in an oddly entertaining style and it is a book that I think anyone should read.  If you have any familiarity with finance this may seem like rehashing what you know, but the author has written it as it was intended to be read; for a more complete education in this area you should see any of the finance textbooks you come across and read them.\nThere is a chapter in the work, about how to understand the odds of success in poker, which applies to other competitive, risky environments.\nThe book is about two things.  I think many people have read the book or at least heard of the book, and the author, and simply don't know what they think of it.  Reading the reviews and articles is useful, but it's best to read the book and see what you think of it.\n\nA: *\n\n*\"Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Innovation\"\n\n*\"Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in the World of Business\"\n\n*\"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable\"\n\n*\"Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder\"\n\n\nI am a fan of Nassim Taleb (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Taleb) and I have recently started to read the \"Antifragile\" one. If you want to get to know the author, there is a documentary with him named \"The Man Who Would be King\" which is about his struggle to convince people and societies of the validity of extreme randomness.\nThis, my last recommendation (so far), will let you see Nassim's personality:\n\n\nA: For a brief description I would recommend you the following page (http://www.nassim-nicholas-taleb.com/taleb/fooled.pdf) that describes in a few pages the most crucial aspects of the book. For a more comprehensive description I would recommend the Wikipedia page which contains some of the relevant reviews.\nTo give you an idea of the level of discussion of this book and its author I recommend you reading this\n\"The Taleb Review\"  edited by Nassim Nassim. You will find reviews about this book as well as other reviews about other books of this author written by the author. Nassim Taleb seems to be highly respected among people that are part of this particular community of thinkers that like to discuss ideas like this one on a global scale.\nAnd, to give you an idea of the audience for discussion of this book I would highly recommend you reading this book review of a book review of this book by Nassim Taleb\nhttp://www.nassim-nicholas-taleb.com/taleb/critic.pdf The first few pages of this book review are particularly illuminating if you want to know about the level"

Can you please also compare that distance to the distance of the center of the Andromeda galaxy from Earth?\n12.1.1 How far away is Andromeda galaxy from Earth?\nThere is an enormous number of galaxies! (10^41 in recent estimates on the size of the visible universe.) And we live in one galaxy, Milky Way galaxy. So I think that your question “Can you please also compare that distance to the distance of the center of the Andromeda galaxy from Earth?” is not quite well expressed. Please take a few seconds to read my answer to question #1 above and please also read questions #2 and #5 above.\nI'll answer the one about Andromeda in a few minutes. First, let's continue with Sgr A*.\nThere is a great video on Youtube – “How black holes are discovered? – A visual guide” – which is so useful! The video was published on 13 June 2006. The authors are not mentioned. I think that it is important that it is on Youtube. A scientific paper on this great video has been published in the journal Plos One (Plos One is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal, published by the Public Library of Science). The paper is titled “Visualization of Astrophysical Objects for an Educational Audience”.\nHere is the paper on the great video above.\nHere is the great video on Youtube – “How black holes are discovered? – A visual guide”.\nLet’s continue: Sgr A* isn't the only source of X-rays detected in the Galactic Center. So what are its counterparts? The infrared counterparts are the most important. Let’s consider the 2MASS source IRAS F17355-3247 which is a very nearby infrared source of the Milky Way galaxy. Here is a recent paper on IRAS F17355-3247 – “Infrared emission from the center of the Milky Way with the VISTA telescope”.\n“Its infrared counterpart, IRAS F17355-3247, is found to be an infrared bright and compact source, with a mid-infrared luminosity of 6.3×1038 ergs s−1, located 11 pc from\nthe Galactic center in the direction of the Galactic center black hole (GCBH), giving an estimate for the Eddington limit of the GCBH to be 4.25×1036 ergs s−1.\nIn this paper, they consider an analysis on the “dynamical mass of the GCBH”. They derive that “An accurate estimate of the dynamical mass of Sgr A* is important for future research on the dynamics of black holes, and constrains the size of the dark disk, a possible component of the Galactic potential”.\nThey continue:\n“We first report the discovery of a new source, IRAS 17355-3247, located 1.4 pc from Sgr A*. The source is detected at a high completeness level in V, R and J, and its brightness is consistent with that of Sgr A* in the J band.\nWe consider the dynamical properties of Sgr A* as well as the GCBH by using high-resolution VLBI observations. With the assumption of a point mass, the astrometric data indicate a radius of R ≃ 3.8 pc and an inner accretion disk, which is consistent with the GCBH. Using the astrometric velocity data, we estimate the dynamical mass. The source is also detected in the K band, enabling more accurate estimates of its luminosity and temperature, but we still have significant uncertainties with a range of 1-5 K.\nThe X-ray flux of Sgr A*, ⟨F X⟩ ~ 1.6 × 10-9 erg s-1 cm-2, as estimated by \\textit{Chandra} is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that observed by \\textit{XMM-Newton}.\nAlthough the observations support that Sgr A* is a Kerr black hole, the X-ray behavior is still mysterious.\nIRAS 17355-3247 appears to be an extended but not too strong X-ray source. In this study, we also present a new analysis method for deriving the black hole mass from an extended disk system.\nWe calculate a dynamical mass of Mdyn = 5.3 × "

You only can use words and your own knowledge. You cannot expose the fact of time travel.\nHow do you approach such task?\n\nA: I would look for someone who is at least on the right track with their philosophy. Someone who has at least the beginnings of a great and grand philosophy. Someone who is open-minded, and who may even realize the greatness of Hitler's philosophy. You would encourage them, you would show them a brighter future, you would show them the potential of freedom. You would introduce them to a life greater than that of Hitlerism. You would try to bring him around to the idea of a more free world.... but that's just a crazy and unlikely dream, eh?\n\nA: Be a part of the 1919-group that Hitler joined. Let him have all his opinions in your group and later convince this group to go against Hitler who you are the leader of. You can start the war yourself.\n\nA: You can be a scientist who knows enough about the inner workings of Hitler's brain.\nYou can set up to him to meet a woman he likes. Then set the date for the wedding and arrange it to be on 29 Nov 1941.\nThe woman is in love with Hitler, who is under the spell of your date, and so is Hitler.\nWhen the day comes, you can say something like, 'Oh dear, I forgot to tell you that your cousin has just arrived.' You can then leave them and the woman you know is going to die as Hitler will be on the way somewhere.\nOr you can use her to make Hitler see the light and let her get killed by the Nazis, who are all under Hitler's spell, by killing the woman when Hitler makes a speech.\n\nA: I know how difficult/impossible to get him to join your team. So I'm gonna give you a solution that gets rid of Hitler asap while protecting humanity. If you were able to travel back in time, you'd probably try to get Hitler and other like-minded people to give up their views and live freely. But even if you try to assassinate Hitler, there is a high chance that it'll fail and it will still put your life on the line.\nThe best way is to get Hitler and other like-minded people to join the Nazi party, the Communist, the Zionist or any group of their choosing. Once they do that, you have them under your control: either the Jewish people, you or the other party's leaders will let Hitler join the group to have better leaderships on all the parties and to make them more influential. After this, you can use Hitler to do evil things while in the group's name. The group's influence will be greater and the Nazi party will be the main target of the people's resentment, not all of the Nazi's own ideas will be lost too.\nEven when Hitler's influence is getting more powerful, he won't be able to be a true dictator. His position is going to be weak: he has to work for betterment and he has to face people's disbelief every day. You can use this advantage to convince him to let Germany become a democratic state.\nOn the other hand, if you were not able to convince him to join a better group and you wanted to stop his actions, he'd probably be more of a danger in the future. Once you tried to assassinate him, he'd get more paranoid and he'd probably have a better way than his own thoughts to become a dictator and control the whole state by a lot of bloodshed. Once he has become a full-time dictator, all you can do to get rid of him would be to let people to start to fight him by starting a coup d'tat, at that time, he will probably have a lot more people to die as a result. You can't let him die alone, because there'd been nothing left to gain from his death.\nBut what if you didn't want to get back to the present yet? \nIf you wanted to remain in 1919, you could take your time to let Hitler join the group and you can try convincing him to become a more effective leader, you can let other dictators do the dirty works of the group, to get him less suspicious and you can let his idea to do good at first, but when they are starting to do evil things, you are going to make the people trust you in order to let them trust you even you were not going to do anything good, to convince Hitler to let the group become more democratic and he won't be a true dictator"

        "output": "What is the difference betwean interpreted compiled and JIT-ed programming language, can you also tell me some benefits of each type of language?\nCan you give me at least 3 examples from each of these categories of programming languages?\nThe only real benefit of programming languages is that there are 1000s of them to choose from.  No one wants to try and understand all of them on their own, it's so much more fun to use an interpreter or compiler.  An interpreter is really a compiler -- in this case the \"compiler\" is running inside a user process, and emits bytecodes (or whatever) which are then interpreted later by something else entirely.  Either way the \"compiler\" is just a program.  (JIT-ed is actually a pretty nasty name for what is really an implementation detail, and isn't actually a compilation phase.)\n\nI don't mean to insult you, but isn't that a bit rude just to point the finger at the interpreter and say that the interpreter is so much simpler that they just don't understand the code that's written to it?  After all, an interpreter could be a lot more clever, it could just interpret each line, that's not that hard, right?\n\nIt depends what the \"line\" is.  A line of a shell script would be simple.  A line of a \"makefile\" might not be.  There is also the possibility that an \"interpreter\" could execute a line in an arbitrary process.  This would not be a line of code at all.  It would be an input to a program which the user expects to output something based on that input.  Then they expect that output to become \"the code\" being executed next.  That is the problem with calling this JIT.  It's not \"just in time\", it's \"instant execution\".  All of the work needed to interpret something that just executes that code as a whole has just been done once for every single character that ever gets typed into the program.  This is very useful to a lot of people, it's how they actually write these kinds of programs, but it's not the same kind of \"interpretation\" an actual interpreter would use.\n\nAlso, what does \"interpreted\" or \"interpreter\" mean in this context?  I mean, it seems to me that they are both the same, but really they are different.\n\nNo, that's wrong.  An \"interpreter\" is a program which runs a piece of code one instruction at a time.  It doesn't do what a \"compiler\" does either, a \"compiler\" can use a program called \"compactor\" (which is what you really mean by \"interpreter\" in this case) to \"compile\" the code and get it down to a form which is easy to manage.  But what that code does at the assembly language level is still just run one instruction at a time.  It isn't, for example, anything like a CPU.  The CPU actually executes code line-by-line, it doesn't execute \"statements\" and \"expressions\" and \"instructions\" at the same time, it only executes one of those instructions at a time.\n\nA: \nAlso, what does \"interpreted\" or \"interpreter\" mean in this context?\n\nThere is some ambiguity here. The term \"interpret\" is used in two contexts. When the term is applied to an assembly language program (\".asm\"), it means that this program is \"compiled into\" a binary executable (\".exe\").\nIt's also used to describe the process of converting some kind of source language text (like a C++ program) into an assembly language program. The machine is \"interpreting\" the source language code in order to convert it into the appropriate assembly language, and then \"compiling\" the resultant assembly language into an executable that can be run on the actual machine.\nThe most common kind of interpreter is the program that runs the source language program on itself, line by line according to the syntax of the source language (or other source). This is the usual way to run an interpreter.\nThe term C++ has been used that way for almost 25 years. Some old-timers still do it the old fashioned way. Many programmers do it with a \"compiler\". This is a program that reads the source language text and uses a compiler to produce an assembly language program, thus eliminating any need for an interpreter or a separate compiler.\nIn recent years, this same kind of text processing has been used by new languages and their compilers. One example is Python 3's type of code -- you have .pyc ."

        "output": "Would you be able to design an electric Pokémon? Describe it as best as you can and also give me the stats of that Pokémon.\nYou’re just messing with me aren’t you 🤣, there must be a list of electric Pokemon somewhere.\nI was in the middle of writing an elaborate response saying that when I realized that you had already put my idea into words. 😄 What a coincidence.\nIt’s not really an elaboratethat but, anywho, I guess that means it’s ok for me to answer your question.\nI would create a Pokémon with the Electric and Ice type. This Pokémon is really strong on ice terrain, but you have to play its stats down or else it doesn’t do anything. When you take it out of the ice terrain, it gets so much stronger that you can easily beat anything in the game. Then, when you’re actually fighting it, nothing happens. It’s like it’s trying to attack you and the move won’t go thru. It’s basically just spamming move after move and just waiting on you to call out another move. This Pokémon has two moves.\nWhat is it called? Well, here we go\nIt’s called Shudder.\nWe all could learn a lesson for what to expect in college, but that’s another topic.\nSo it’s a shudder? That’s like when you shudder and think “man, those damn Indians are right again, that’s cold.”\nDo you have a description for it, or are you just using the powerof words to describe it’s weakness?\nIt should have 1/156 speed. Since it’s a Water/Ice type, it should have ¼ of the Base Speed of a regular Water/Ice Type. You add the Base Speed of a Water, and the Base Speed of an Ice and divide by two.\nWell it’s also a Pokémon, so don’t be afraid to name it. The only thing, I don’t need a long answer here, but a small explanation would be fine.\nShudder is like the electric/water equivalent of the Ice Beam move. It paralyzes your opponent with shock waves. The only difference is that your opponent can’t actually be paralyzed. When your opponent gets the stun from Shudder, it’s like it’s just waiting for you to release another move and Shudder will just attack again. It’s basically an infinite, paralyzing attack that you can use on anyone while they sleep. The only thing I will say is that it should always come out as Shudder.\nWhat does the Ice Type help with? Well, that’s hard to tell from just the type. Would it help with freezing things?\nI don’t really know. It should help with Ice. Also, it should be able to use Water moves like Freeze, Ice Beam, etc. It should also be able to use Water/Ice types moves like Haze, Mist or Rain.\nI honestly don’t know why they gave it a 1/156 speed. That’s a shame.\nThanks, I will take that into consideration.\nAlso, give me your Pokemon’s stats or tell me how many HP you have.\nIt has a base speed of 12/156\nI thought you said 40 HP.\nMaybe you don’t know how to play?\nI’m not the one who would be stuck in a game where I can’t beat or win.\nWell, you would have to know your enemy’s attack and defense values.\nI’m the enemy? What’s this got to do with me 🤷‍♀️?\nBecause you asked. Just so you know, this thing looks like this:\nWhat’s it called again?\nThat’s Shudder.\nI don’t even have a name for this type. I don’t even know what the name of this type is.\nIt’s a type of ice and water.\nNo, I meant the type name of that.\nI don’t know. It has a name. I don’t know what it is.\nLet’s stop this…It’s a move.\nA Pokémon move?\nYeah, that’s what I said.\nIs this Pokémon dead?\nI don’t know, but it’s not even good at it’s own type.\nWhat type is it?\nIt’s an Ice/Water.\nI still don’t know what the type is though. I know that’s the one you always have to remember.\nThat’s what I said.\nAlso, you said the Ice type would help, but not even an Ice/Water Pokémon can do ice."

        "instruction": "what does the @ in python do",
        "output": "what does the @ in python do\n>>> @Decorator\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is to ask about what is the @ ( at symbol ) and what is it's purpose and what exactly it does. I know this is a short-cut to adding a function or making an object class inside another function/object. But to understand it better before that I want to know what is @ in the syntax of python.\n\nA: In Python, an @ operator can be used to bind a variable to the value of another function. It's called decorator notation.\nLet's assume we have some function like this:\ndef print_something():\n    print('Something')\n\nNow let's say we want to modify the above function in some way. If that function was bound to some name, we can decorate it using the @ notation:\n@print_something\ndef print_something_new():\n    print(\"I'm a new thing!\")\n\nNow print_something_new will have the same behavior as a printed_something would, which is to print \"Something\" to the console. This is called decorator and it can be used to add additional functionality over and above the function's original behavior.\nOne common decorator pattern is for debugging with pytest\nimport logging\n\n@logging.simplefile('test_file')\ndef func():\n    logging.debug('Hello, world!')\n\nThis decorator will print out each line of the function that passes through it to a file named 'test.log'.\nMore on decorators can be found here:\nhttps://pymotw.com/2/decorators/\n\nA: In Python 3.3, there is an object called @ which was introduced in PEP 342 called a \"decorator\", which can be used to apply a custom action to an object, like adding a value to it. This makes it possible to combine code using @ to decorate various object functions with a single custom action.\nI hope this question helps someone that may be interested in understanding how @ does work, or even write custom decorators.\nThe other answer explains how decorators work. I will try to focus on how @ is used.\nHow to Use @ with Functions\nPython allows you to use @ to write functions as a decorator, which allows you to combine @ with other @ decorators, for example:\n\n*\n\n*First function can be any function, say @f()\n\n*@f() can be any other function, say second function\n\n*f() can be any third function\n\ndef f():\n    return 5\n\n\ndef s():\n    return 20\n\n@f\n@s\ndef t():\n    return 0\n\nt() # 25\n\nThe above code gives a new function called t but with additional parameters from s() and f(), which will return 25.\nYou are allowed to use the @ before a function or an object inside a function. It can be just once, or it can be any number of times, like:\n\n*\n\n*@\n\n*@@\n\n*@@@\n\n*@@@@\n\nUsing @@ on object\nYou can also use @@ on a class. In the first case you can add parameters. For example, we can create a class like this:\n\nclass ExampleClass(object):\n    def __init__(self, name=0):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def say(self, other:bool):\n        if other:\n            print(f\"Hello, World!\")\n            return\n\n        return self.name\n\nAnd the same object can call @@ on it, to apply custom rules to the object, for example:\n\n@ExampleClass\ndef t(other:bool):\n    if other is True:\n        return 5\n    return 10\n\nThis way you can change the value returned or the behavior of some function, if not using @, you can only do these as you like inside the function.\nOr you can use both together, such as:\n\n@ExampleClass(name=\"Hello Class\")\ndef t(name, other:bool):\n    return super().say() + name.upper()\n\nThis way you only need one custom function and you can define all the attributes and change the default function\nUsing @ on Classes\nYou can also use @ on classes, like this:\n\nclass SomeClass(object):\n    pass\n\n@SomeClass\nclass NewClass(object):\n    def some_method(self, a):\n        return a\n\n# or the same like:\n# @Some"

        "instruction": "Can we find a formula to generate all prime numbers, and is the distribution of primes truly random?",
        "output": "Can we find a formula to generate all prime numbers, and is the distribution of primes truly random?\nA good approach would be to use a computer program. The idea of the search algorithm is to look at all the previously known prime numbers and use that information to make sure that when we find a new one, we have not already added it to the list. Then, repeat this until there is no further growth in the list.\nIn order to find any numbers, we need something to compare other numbers against. In this case, we use modulo.\nWe will begin with some numbers, 3 and 5 are prime. So what do we do? Add them both to a list, or store them? We have created something called a list and we have created the number 8 because 3 and 5 both added to the list give us 8.\nThe next thing we ask is, well, if the numbers 3 and 5 are prime, whats the next number?\nNow, before we dive further into the math, I want to take the time to say these methods work. They are actually great methods. If you do not know how to do this, please try and do it. Because its a good thing to know how to program. However, I will provide explanations as it goes along.\nWhen we say some is prime, we mean, multiplying by 2 or 3 doesnt work. To test to see if 8 is prime, we will multiply by 2. 8 multiplied by 2 is 16, which equals 3 times 5, 15. 15 is prime. When you multiply something by 2 or 3, if thats prime, it will become some other number you want and that other number is prime.\nLet me remind you again, the prime number test is that anything other than 2 will not work, so if one of the numbers youre making up is prime, youve just made up a true prime number. It turns out its not that hard to know when something is prime. Multiplying it by another factor has to make it to 1 or -1.\nSo what we can do is add multiple of some to a list that we have defined, a list that we can add to, or simply just to have a method to store values. In doing this, the list stays the same every time we do it, and so we will always call this an array. This is not your typical math array because this one only works with prime numbers. We can call that List a set of 2 number.\nLets start by looking at an even number, two integers which are prime, 3 and 5. Here are their numbers, 3 and 5. Now, lets work with those numbers and add them to a list. Now, if I wanted more, how would I make more list entries?\nI could use numbers, but numbers might get in the way, or I could use variables. I will try it by creating two variables, x and y, just put in an easy number, 2 or 3, and then put them in an array.\nI just got two numbers that dont work as well, 15 and 5. I dont want to start putting things into list every time because that would take a long time.\nNow, if youre interested, I can explain how to do this better, but you dont have to, its not difficult to do for the next set. This is called a modulo. When I use it is when I just use 5. What it does is to see if it goes beyond that. If it does, that means I have a bigger number. Now, what am I going to do? I am going to divide it by 2, and when I divide it, the number will divide by a factor that leaves me with exactly 2. Therefore, 5 / 2 is exactly 2, and I get that 2. So I add that to my collection.\nWe know that two does not work.\nSo we dont use them.\nWe look to add the 2 to our list, its prime. Then, we add our 3 and we have our 6. 6 is our 3 multiplied by 2, so we have our 6. And in our list, we have our collection, our set of 2 numbers. It says 3, 5, 2, and 6.\nNow, what the heck? This does not seem like randomness. Well, it kind of has to work out.\nThe first number I chose, 3, is not prime. So when I multiply that, I get 9, which is no good since thats 3 times 3. So, we dont want that in there because when I add it through, its not prime. And, in order to get a"

The site had been used for two things, at least in recent years:\nA center for peace and reconciliation, with the “Peace Pole,” which is in the map at the left. We saw the pole there. It was also a place to hold candle vigils or pray. We have no current information on that aspect.\nA center for religious faith, with classes, programs, and occasional meetings.\nIt started in 2004 with a project to create a labyrinth in a garden outside the sanctuary. It was the first in a series of labyrinths built around the church, with one inside the church. It wasn’t until 2007 that it began to be known as The Maze.\nThe Maze.\nI didn’t pay attention to this until a few days ago, when a friend in an ecumenical group told me the church had decided to dissolve the entire organization. A few weeks ago, a labyrinth was placed in the middle of the sanctuary. But on Sunday, it was announced that the rest of The Maze would be dismantled.\nFor nearly two decades, The Maze was a center for our community. Some have wondered whether its demise is a sign of the times. It’s certainly an indication of where our local community is or has been.\nThe site has apparently been sold, and a new organization (name unknown) will emerge. One of the problems it has had was an inability to build on its existing donations. I’ll be curious to see how that goes. It will not likely have a name that matches the Maze. It will probably not have the Peace Pole.\nThe Maze, a photo from 2014.\nNow it’s become known as The Maze, a place of contemplation and wonder, of peace, joy and hope. We didn’t know the history and meaning that the place represented. We thought it was just our local version of a labyrinth.\nWhen the Maze was announced on the church website, I was astonished. I had seen the news at another local church whose blog was updated.\nA few days later, my friend, an executive of the other organization, phoned to tell me that he was also shocked. It was an incredible irony. She tried to offer words of comfort. He wasn’t comforted.\nI remember visiting The Maze the first time – not at the site, but in a meeting. Someone was leading a discussion of the place and its purpose. I was fascinated by the concept, which is still puzzling to many.\nI was even more enchanted when I saw the photos on the website. The peace pole was there, but other photos showed it as a place to build a sense of community. There were weddings and events there, and a sense of mystery and"

If thats not an option, a stopover might be possible, as long as its 24 hours.\nThe other way is to get a sleeper room. When I was traveling by train with my husband, we had a compartment. Thats a private bedroom with access to a bathroom and toilet and a room where we could sit down, watch the countryside and sleep when we felt tired. It also had a big plate window, curtains, etc. Thats not cheap, but then again traveling by train is not cheap (it doesnt get cheaper to fly anymore, and sometimes it is even more expensive).\nIf youre coming from outside Europe, theres a train company called Eurostar from London to Paris. Eurostar trains do not stop in France, Belgium, or England. They do not stop, but they do pass right over London and get there in the same amount of time it would take a train that stops in London. The Eurostar train also gets to Paris in a shorter time (Ive been told). The train to London does stop at Calais (in France), for example, which is why the French (who think of Calais as part of France) claim that the train is shorter in their direction than in the opposite direction! Ive heard its also possible to take a local train while Eurostar is in the same station in Europe.\nI know its pretty late, but I wanted to add a few more ideas and some info about the time difference, if youre not doing that yet.\nHave you seen this post on the blog Frommers.com? They recommend the same activities, but they recommend taking 2 nights for each day instead of 1. I thought it was really interesting.\nIf you decide to take 2 nights for each day, I assume that youll have to decide where you eat that night, since you might have to go back to Paris after the day trip.\nI know that you can get a round-trip ticket to Paris or Lille (near Paris) for Eurostar trains on the Eurostar website, but I dont know if that also works with a single ticket. Maybe someone else knows something more specific about that.\nIn regards to the time difference, if youre coming from California, you dont have to go to sleep while youre in Paris or France otherwise, because youre actually traveling from California to England, or England to California. If youre going to the other direction, from England to Calais, then you have to go to sleep while youre in France. Its like traveling from California to Boston and back, except that its just easier to stay up that whole day in California.\nDo you like it when they tell the train when to pull into the station before you need to leave the train?\nTheres a way to avoid that. Just go to the next station, which isnt London, get off, and then try to get back on the correct train at Cambridge, since the next stop there is London.\nWe had that happen a few months ago and we realized that we could have just missed the train in London, so we stayed in Cambridge overnight instead.\nHave you ever watched"

        "output": "Using critical thinking methods, how would you approach and solve the following problem: A local restaurant is experiencing a decrease in customers, and the owner wants to understand the cause and find a solution. What steps would you take to gather information, analyze the situation, and develop potential solutions? The restaurant owner told me that his business had been declining steadily over the last 3 months, which led him to believe that customers had simply stopped coming, but more than two-thirds of his restaurant’s staff agreed that there were too few customers to support their full force of 10 servers. When confronted with this claim, the owner was confused. He couldn’t understand what was going on, because he’s been in business for 10 years, and he’s never had that experience. He’s been able to successfully compete with the other restaurants and grow the business over time. To help the owner, I interviewed each of the restaurant employees, as well as the management team. After the interviews, I compiled the data and used the results to generate some ideas for solving the problem. Ultimately, we used the interview response from one of the servers to determine the cause of the problem—the restaurant’s menu was too expensive and required too much preparation work—that led to the decline in sales. We decided to redesign the menu to align it with the prices and food preparation requirements of that specific demographic. Following the solution, we worked with the employees to set a goal for the restaurant staff and determine which departments would have the biggest impact. To do that, we split the team into smaller departments and assigned sales expectations to each employee. Once the sales numbers were assigned to each employee, we created a strategy that included a rewards and recognition system to motivate the staff. This approach enabled us to make an impact on the business quickly and effectively. The outcome was that all of the employees understood the goals and what they were responsible for, and they could work collaboratively to make a big impact. In addition, because management played an active role in the program, employees felt like their input was valued. It also increased employee retention, which is important for business success, as you will see later. Case Solution - Solution of the Problem - The steps to solve a problem at the restaurant are outlined below: The first step is to identify the problem. The owner told you that his business had been declining over 3 months. The second step is to analyze the situation.

        "output": "What are F-centers in crystallography ? How are they created and what consequences do they have on the overall appearance of crystal ?\nThe concept of a focal plane (or \"f-plane\") was initially invented as a mathematical definition of the planes where the image formed by a lens was focused. F-centers are similar, in that they are the planes in a crystal where some or all of the reflections are aligned, although they are not required to be planes.\nThe key distinction between this concept and the crystallographic definition is that the planes on which the reflections are aligned are not defined by the crystal symmetry (crystallographic), and can have multiple orientation. That is, there can be multiple sets of f-centers in one crystal.\nWe can imagine that the f-planes exist because of interactions with the electrons. The electrons have the same charge distribution in the crystal, and so have the same electric field in the crystal. But, there is a finite density of electrons and one would expect that some of this density will be at the locations where the electric potential varies the least. The electron wave functions would tend (on average) to minimize the overlap around some planes in the crystal. While it is not entirely clear how this occurs, it can be shown that the f-centers can be predicted well from electric density predictions (http://eigenvector.jlab.org/content/44/5.full.pdf).\nThe concept of F-centers was first applied to ionic crystals by Brillouin in his book, \"Introduction to the Theory of Crystal Lattices\". In particular he noted that the locations of F-centers in lead iodide were a good guide to the positions of the f-centers in barium titanate. The name \"F-center\" came from the early work in 1950 on lead iodide where the locations of the F-centers in the crystal was used to locate and separate the barium and titanic impurities.\nF-centers affect the diffraction pattern to give \"extra intensity\" at the F-centers but the appearance of which F-centers are present in a crystal is a complicated problem: it depends on which part of the crystal you sample, how the crystallization occurred, and how the F-centers \"overlapped\" (a bit like trying to tell the two sides of a coin).\nThere have been a number of attempts to predict the F-centers in crystals (Rice, Koster, and Rietzke) but they have not had much success: ( http://science.sciencemag.org/content/270/5237/1150.full). However, new work is now giving promising results:\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/0957-4484/47/12/123202\nOne issue is that F-centers are not an intrinsic feature of crystallography, unlike Bragg reflections. In fact, Bragg reflections are a special type of F-center.\nSome of the consequences of f-centers in a crystal is best illustrated by three examples:\n1. Ionic crystals: F center in a crystal can give rise to an Efrenkel polarization. These are often found at the F-centers. The Efrenkel polarization is important in the behavior of many crystals, including phase transitions and other symmetry breaking phenomena.\n2. Molecular crystals: The F-centers affect the interactions between the molecules, as has been found for a variety of molecular crystals, including sugars, nucleic acids, and lipids\n3. Binary crystals: F-centers can be found in the crystal lattice. These can occur because of differences due to impurities, chemical or isotopic. It is these impurities that give the color of the crystal, or the electrical properties, and are the basis for separating them in many experiments.\nThese three examples show a number of interrelated topics, but illustrate the importance of this general concept.\nby jake on June 4th 2015, 12:54pm\nFracture Energy (Bond Dissociation Energy) in Graphene\nSo I've spent quite a bit of time reading, researching, playing around with this concept and I'm still not getting my head around it fully but I think I've at least grasped the gist.\nIn a few weeks, my lab will be getting one of the first single layer graphene devices, so I've been trying to get my head around this concept of what the fundamental limit to it's electrical conductance might be.\nI'm not going to rattle off the equations, I'll let those be the reference for those who want to read more"

Why is it important for renters to have options when moving to a new neighborhood? Why are housing costs important for a family? Why are rents a small proportion of the income of most people? Why are housing costs often a concern for\nboth low- and high-income families?\nBecause housing costs for families make up a significant portion of\nthe familyâ€™s budget.\nIt might take a huge portion of their income\nand sometimes for low-income families they donâ€™t have enough money to\njust pay their rent and basic necessities and pay for other things that they\nmay need or that they want.\nHousing costs for low-income families are often a concern because so\nmuch of their income is spent on housing.\nBecause a lot of people donâ€™t want to move to a new neighborhood and have\nbeen there for a long time so it is very important for them to have options\nwhen it comes to moving to a new neighborhood .\nExplain how the cost of housing impacts poor and low-income families.

        "instruction": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?",
        "output": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?\nThe wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms. How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?\nIf you are wondering how to improve the wireless networks coverage at home because of weak signals in some rooms, here are some solutions that can help:\n1. Switch to a wireless router with a longer range.\nYou can buy a router with a longer range (typically a dual-band access point) that uses 802.11ac MIMO and a higher gain antenna to extend the signal up to 230 feet or more. A high-gain access point extends the wireless signal up to two times the distance of a standard router.\n2. If you have the option, choose a router with MU-MIMO support.\nFor a wireless router, MU-MIMO (Multiuser  Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology can be a game changer. It provides better bandwidth and better coverage compared to the non-MU-MIMO router, even if the distance is about the same. The main difference is that MU-MIMO can support up to 10 devices and send data at the same time through its 6 GHz frequency band. This means your device can get more data and less buffering.\nA router with MU-MIMO technology uses an antenna with directional transmission to improve the signal strength and reduce signal interference. It transmits signals in parallel instead of in sequence. This means more devices can use it at the same time.\nIt is not the only router with this feature. There are some other routers that support MU-MIMO, but they lack the ability to work with Wi-Fi 6 on 5 GHz frequency bands.\n3. Extend the range with an Internet amplifier or WiFi repeater.\nAnother good solution to extend the wireless Internet signal is by using an amplifier or wireless repeater. A wireless amplifier or a WiFi repeater is a device that improves the Wi-Fi signal strength in your home. It extends the signal up to 300 feet from your router because it boosts the signals received from your router. Also, an amplifier or repeater does not affect your wireless signal speed.\n4. Change the positions of your router and access points or use a new access point.\nSome people have strong Wi-Fi signal outside the home, but its weak inside the house. If this is the case, the problem may be the position of your router (as long as its in the right place), rather than the range. The best location for your router has good line of sight to your modem. The router should also be as far from walls as possible and at the center of your home. Also, avoid putting your router on a surface that reflects sound. Do not put your router on a surface with a texture that has ridges, bumps, or dimples (or a table or shelf), which will create echoes. Finally, make sure the rooms around your router are properly ventilated to protect the router from heat.\n5. Upgrade to the latest Wi-Fi standard: Wi-Fi 6.\nWi-Fi 6 is a brand new wireless standard that offers more speed and less latency as compared to older wireless standards, such as 2.4-band wireless or Wi-Fi 5. Wi-Fi 6 also improves efficiency and stability in a crowded environment. It also supports more devices, has better power consumption, and provides better reliability and security.\nIn addition to Wi-Fi 6, some Wi-Fi 5 routers with the 802.11ac-MU-MIMO and MU-MIMO support can also provide better and broader coverage to your home wireless network.\nWi-Fi devices use bandwidth, where bandwidth refers to the amount of information sent or received every second. Data transmits in real-time using a data rate that depends on the frequency or the speed of information sent.\nSo what does it mean to have a low data rate or low-speed Wi-Fi?\nFor example, an 802.11 ac router is capable of transmitting data at 1.3 Gbps. If you have an older router, it can only transmit data up to 250 Mbps, that is, much slower than an 802.11 ac router.\nMany factors affect the speed of your Wi-Fi, but one of the most important is your routers range.\nFor example, the distance between a router and a device can affect the speed of the information when transmitting from the device to the router. That is why home wireless routers must be correctly positioned to make sure that you receive the Wi-Fi at the same speed no matter where you are in the home.\nA Wi-Fi router with a greater range will make the"

        "output": "Why can't you see the stars in the city, but you can in the countryside? The reason is that stars and other celestial bodies have an electric charge. They are surrounded by the electric field of the Earth and shine in the dark because of this electric field.\nElectrons are around the earth by a huge number. They give the Earth an electric field of positive charge. It is easy for us to feel this electric field - in fact, we are surrounded by it and it has been an important part of our lives for a long time:\nHow long does it take for electricity to reach us here on the Earth? Imagine that lightning strikes the ground and it takes the electric field exactly 50 milliseconds to reach the Earth and we feel it. After 51 mm, it's time for the electric field to take the opposite direction.\nBecause of all the electrons around the Earth, the electric field is so rich that it is even possible to conduct electrical currents here. We see it as lightning, and if you have ever felt an electric shock, you know how it feels like to be in this electric field.\nThe electric field of the Earth is a part of the natural electric charges on the Earth, because in its composition it has one positive and one negative charge.\nLet's take a look at how energy is transferred in this image.\nThe Earth's electric charge\nEnergy of a charged body\nAll objects have their own charges that result in the presence of a specific electric field. These charges are transferred to and from the body's surface, because they don't move freely inside the body.\nElectric fields are defined as all the forces that act on electric charges. These forces may be static or dynamic, so they may cause movement of electric charges.\nElectrical conductivity\nElectrical conductivity is a phenomenon by which a charged body allows the passage of a certain energy.\nIt is a measure expressing the ease or difficulty of the transfer of electric charge through a conductor.\nIt is measured based on the value of the electric field in the medium. Conducting materials (liquids and solids) have a larger electric conductivity than non-conducting ones (non-conducting ones).\nConductor conductivity\nConductor - Materials through which electric current flows easily are called conductors.\nInsulator - Materials through which the electric current flows at low speed and is not easy to move.\nNonconductor - Materials in which electric current does not flow at all.\nAll materials that carry electricity are electric.\nSince materials are electric, they are electric. This means that they contain electrons and are exposed to electric fields. Therefore, all of them can carry an electric charge.\nElectrostatic energy\nElectric fields - when electric charges are set up are called electric fields. These fields are present in all materials, and the magnitude and sign of the charge depends on whether they are static or dynamic.\nThe energy of a field of static charges is very important. The total energy of the entire electric field is equal to the energy of the electric field multiplied by the total amount of electric charge in the field.\nIf we take the case of two static charges that are oppositely charged, each of them absorbs an equal amount of energy from the surrounding electric field. This is important because it means that the more charge is around the objects, the more energy it will have. Therefore, if we consider two electrodes with a different charge, then the electrode with the higher charge will have an electrical field and it will exert more force than the electrode, with less charge.\nThe difference in the number of charges in the electrical field between the two objects is the result of the electrical field that the object has with the surrounding environment. The electrode that has less charges in the field, absorbs a smaller amount of energy and is weaker. When the distance between the two objects is doubled, the power is halved. So the more powerful the electric field, the more it is.\nThe electric field intensity (E) is proportional to the electric charge itself and the distance between the two stationary objects.\nHow to calculate the potential difference between two stationary objects is a question that is answered very simply. The electrical field, or more precisely, the charge at the position and the distance between the two objects, determines the potential difference.\nLet's take away the force between two stationary objects. The force can be calculated by knowing the electrical field between the two objects and their separation.\nNow let's suppose that it is easy for us to feel the electrical field and we can even measure the speed of the electric field in the medium. Then we can get a lot of energy by connecting two or more objects with an electric field.\nSo if the distance from the two objects is doubled, then we should expect the result to halve the power to. But this is not the case!\nWhen you connect two objects and"

A woman is likely to experience this between four and eight weeks after the birth, including on or around Christmas.\nIn order to minimise the likelihood of baby blues, it is important to reduce stress and anxiety in pregnancy and to avoid giving birth at Christmas time due to increased hospital staff workloads.\nPsychiatrist Dr Lisa McGirr said it was important to seek treatment for these episodes in order to prevent them from happening again.\n“The episode usually resolves with support from friends and family, or, for a few couples, the birth of a second child,” Dr McGirr said.\n“But it is important to discuss with your medical practitioner whether further support is necessary to ensure this does not happen again.”\nPsychiatrist Dr Melissa Rawlings said the Christmas period was often a “real challenge” for young children.\n“It is important for parents to check in with their children on a regular basis during this time of year, particularly if they might be feeling lonely, anxious, isolated or even sad,” Dr Rawlings said.\n“Talking therapy in the form of playdates with children from a school or community centre can be beneficial to help children feel like they belong and are accepted.”\nThe holiday period was also something that parents should work toward “rather than resist”, she said.\n“We want to encourage parents to think about how they can have a family tradition to help them through the holiday season to support the transition into the new year,” Dr Rawlings said.\n“This could include the preparation of festive dinner, singing Christmas carols in the car on the way to a visit, or even a trip to the Santa train.\n“These can all provide moments of family bonding to get you through a difficult time.\n“We also recommend families focus on giving to others rather than taking as the holiday season approaches.\n“This will help reduce stress and give our children the opportunity to become aware of those less fortunate than them.”\nAccording to Dr Rawlings, the Christmas period may bring with it the loss of a friend, family member, a pet or a job.\n“It is important to talk openly with your child about these losses and how to cope with the change,” she said.\n“They should be encouraged to express their feelings and concerns to others around them.”\nIn the future, Dr Rawlings said parents should plan “family fun time” activities well before the Christmas period – such as a “secret Santa”.\n“These fun activities and the gift of giving can help us bond together as a family and help our children feel that it is OK to cry or be a bit sad during the festive season.”"

The declaration provided official backing for Zionism: “His Majesty’s government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.”\nThe declaration does not offer a solution to the status of Palestine, which until then has been under Ottoman rule and was subsequently taken over in 1918 by Britain as part of the League of Nations.\nIt has been argued that the declaration offered no specific support to the Jewish people, only to the fact that an international organization, such as the Balfour Declaration “believed it desirable … that such a national home should be built for the Jewish people”.\nThe Balfour Declaration was a major step in an attempt to create a state for the Jewish people.\nThe Arab opposition to the declaration was that in his declaration, Balfour “did not recognize the rights of the Arabs and denied Palestine to be their country.\nThe Jewish leaders of Palestine believed that the declaration was a step in the right direction and that Britain would support their cause.\nThe Arab opponents of the declaration argued that “the Arabs of Palestine are not able to stand up to the Jews of Palestine who are not only more numerous than they, but are also armed to the teeth.\nThe Arab leader Husayn bin Ali told Balfour that if it was not possible to create a Jewish state in Palestine, they should find another home for them.\nThe Balfour Declaration also had an international impact, as it raised the hopes of the Jews across the world that they could finally return, as the Jews had been denied the right to return to their homeland and were forced to flee Palestine in the 1600s.\nThe Balfourt Act of 1916 gave the British government the right to take all necessary legal measures to establish the rights of Jewish people over their homes in Palestine, which was a key part of the British Empire at that point, and was the first and last country to support Jews in their fight against persecution.\nIt is worth noting that the Balfour Act is not a law of the United Kingdom.\nThe law is now a law of the common law, which is a British law of international importance, and means it can only be passed by Parliament.\nThe Balfors Act of 1817 gave the British government the right to pass a law “allowing and providing for the settlement of Jews in British territory”.\nIn 1821, the act was amended to allow Jews in Palestine to settle “without restriction”.\nThe 1817 law was in effect until 1835, when the British Parliament passed the Balfort Act, which gave British citizens the right “to go abroad and return to their home”.\nThis gave Jewish people in the UK the right “to live, work, do business and worship in any country in the world”\nWhat is DACA and how will it impact our health?\nHow to get your dream health insurance job"

However these strategies may not be as effective as the one-to-one training approach developed by the research.\nFor each of the new habits, you have an established reward system that is applied to any behaviour.

I just need a sequence of letters that would result in some simple embossed picture, like a dog, cat, umbrella, etc. Can you give me a such text?\nHi Mikhail Thanks for reaching out and taking the time to submit a request. If I understand this correctly, youâ€™re looking to create a Braille embossing image of an animal or object, and would like help. While I cannot create such an image myself, my first instinct would be to suggest either to your universityâ€™s Braille printer or to a website that allows such a thing. For example, if I wanted a dog/pug Braille image, first I would Google â€œpug Braille embossingâ€; and given that Iâ€™m on a Mac, I would try this website, http://braillecreature.com/ (Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a good analogous website for Windows as well). Of course, this might not work, as it may not be available for public use. But if it is, and you have access to one of the university Braille printers, then thatâ€™s ideal!\nAnother option would be to look into the Braille translation software that your university has available. I believe theyâ€™re usually referred to as BTN software. If you already know what program to use, you could do so first. For example, I used a BTN called Visable to translate a photo of a flower into Braille over a few days, and did so in an unsupported way, with the assistance of my then-girlfriend, a Braille educator (who is also a software developer)â€”but I think that could be used, too.\nIn any case, good luck and let me know how it goes!\nThereâ€™s just no other way to do it other than to use a Braille embosser? Thereâ€™s no software that I could use to do it on a PC (Iâ€™m using Windows) that will actually produce a Braille embossed image, or even a line of Braille?\nHi Mikhail Many thanks for your follow-up and clarifying comment. Yes, I believe youâ€™re correct. Iâ€™m not familiar with the various BTN software, so perhaps a search would tell you more, but I wouldnâ€™t know how to get help using it. Hopefully your university provides such a program.\nI hope this is helpful, and I wish you success in your project!\nHello, there is a free Braille program to scan a photo of my dog and convert it to braille. I think its a freebie for teachers when they attend summer braille camps. I will look for it, but so far I havenâ€™t found it.\nHi Janice Yes! I too was directed to an online Braille tutorial website, https://www.k12brl.org/, where I found that link in the online textbook section. Thanks!\nAny way I can learn to create Braille text/images in word?\nIt is possible. Check out http://www.virtuousbraille.org/learn.html. I think itâ€™s for PC only at the moment.\nHi BenoÃ®t Thanks for reaching out, and for taking the time to comment. Iâ€™m currently on a work trip in London, and am without enough time (and the English language) to address this request more fully. However, I will certainly do so upon my return. I can say that, as I write in the last paragraph of this article, the best way of getting Braille text is by having someone do it. If she cannot, she may be able to get you some free Braille embossers from your local school. I hope that helps!\nIt would help if you could write the letters as Braille. There isnâ€™t an English letter I can think of that would correspond to the letter x on an US Braille cell.\nBraille is a writing system just like English â€“ it is not an alphabet. â€˜Xâ€™ is not a letter. A letter would be a grapheme that has its own Braille code e.g. d is D; so, it has a separate Braille code for each letter in any alphabet.\nYou can translate â€œThe first book of the New Testamentâ€ or â€œthe word of Godâ€ or â€œhow to liveâ€ into Braille.\nHi, you can do that, by the way, you can also type any of the English alphabet on braille typewriter and print it on braille paper and then you get braille text of any english al"

        "output": "I've recently started playing the turn-based strategy game Into the Breach. I have read online that the game is considered to have 'perfect information'. What is meant by 'perfect information' in this context?\nperfect-information\nPerfect Information\nPerfect information means that for the entire game no new information about your opponents' hand is revealed.\nAn example of this might be a game of 4-player poker. With each hand you see all of your opponents' five cards. You never learn whether your opponent held a spade on the two-card flop, for example. If your opponent raises, you know it's because they have a hand that's worse than their starting hand.\nSome games, such as Go or Chess aren't considered perfect information games because the board is not hidden. This is a very minor difference, though, and shouldn't give anyone reason to call these games imperfect information games. It's still the case that there's no new information about your opponent's strategy until they reveal it by moving pieces on the board.\nNote that I didn't say that all information was revealed to the player immediately. There's some additional time-gap before you learn certain things such as how your opponent is playing (and their strategy). This is often, but not always, tied to the speed of the turn-based strategy game.\nYou can think of \"perfect\" as a technical distinction or a marketing term. It's a description, not a definition.\nAs with a lot of things when it comes to game theory, it's mostly a different way of defining some of the usual concepts.\nIf you have \"complete information\" you have all the information that the current player knows.\nIf you have \"imperfect information\" you have all the information that the current player knows and all that the next player will.\nIf you have \"perfect information\" you have all the information what the previous player has said, all the information what you already know (which doesn't involve your opponents) and all the information what your opponents told you about their current/previous cards.\nIn games where you have more time to spend on your turn, such as Chess, Go or even Dwarf Fortress, you can get away with a lot of imperfect information. Your opponent in chess does not know how you're going to play your next move or which position on the board you're going to take.\nWhen things are a bit more compressed though, as in Poker or a board game with only one move at a time, then you need to play with perfect information to play effectively and quickly.\nTobias KienzlerTobias Kienzler\nOne thing about imperfect information: you get to draw conclusions, and you get to act on them. Even in poker, which is often considered an imperfect information game, you know all the cards you've seen, and if you lose a pot, you know who has a better hand than you.\nSo what is considered a perfect information game is: you have all the information to make an informed decision, but you don't act on it until you're forced to with the passage of time or the completion of a single action. An example of that is a timed game; at any given moment in time, each player has all the available information. They only need to act on that information as they approach their respective game end points.\n– Zazug\nI think the way you define the difference is helpful for a very specific context where you talk about the information being complete and the term \"imperfect information\".\nHowever, the concept is not so narrow. When you talk for example of Poker it is indeed true that I know all information in the sense that I know what card I have been dealt and it remains with me for the whole game. So even if I have no information about you I am already perfect informed, like if I had information about my left hand instead of my right hand.\n– michael.hoffmann\nPoker cards are not shuffled up until at least the third round and it is very unlikely you will see another hand until the next hand. Even with three, four, or five card hands there is not enough information to predict the likelihood of a hold, especially if they don't have many cards. A hold is a strong enough statement to show they are ready to bet and thus have a strong hand. If you have two cards and you bet you don't show they aren't that great.\n– Nurul Huda\n@michael.hoffmann: I'm not so used to defining game theory terms. I'll fix the typo in the example.\n\"Perfect information\" refers to a time at which the player has everything necessary to make a decision and the player has used it. The information must be known and not \"outside information\"...\nA standard"

The author asserts that Rome's fall as a consequence of factors such as an ever-increasing population, the decline of the empire's ability to control the northern territory, and the lack of the ability to protect the borderlands, but I would venture to say that even though these were contributors, they were not the determining factors in the fall of Rome. The author argues that the primary reason for the decline of the empire is a lack of cohesiveness in government, lack of unity in the empire, and inability to sustain the empire.\n\nI believe that the author has overlooked the most important piece of evidence: the fall of Christianity. The author mentions that Christianity was a growing influence in the Roman empire, which it of course was. But even more importantly, Christianity brought with it new, unorthodox ideas, ideals, and expectations. It is Christianity's influence that had a huge, detrimental impact on Rome's decline. Christianity was a new way of life and it changed society in ways that were never before seen. The most noticeable problem with its new ideals was that it made people think more than they did before. Christianity brought with it questions about life's purpose and its impact on Roman society. The Romans of late antiquity were so pre-occupied with the problem of what to do once you're dead and what your purpose in life is if you're alive that they couldn't get along when they were going to have to survive on their own.\n\n**Answer Key -  \nExam 1: Essay Question Only**\n\n**Directions:** Write an essay in which you discuss the main points and illustrate them with examples. Your essay should include a focused, carefully-grounded thesis statement, which should be presented within the first one or two paragraphs. Follow with an introduction that frames the argument and provides more specific information about how the essay is going to proceed. Follow your introduction with several paragraphs that illustrate and explain the various arguments you are making. The essays conclude with a summary of the main conclusions made.\n\n1.\n\nThesis: For the United States, the first thing that should be done to prevent future wars is the elimination of nuclear weapons.\n\nIntroduction: In the present day, nuclear weapons have reached all but the point of being entirely obsolete. This is because of several factors, including the following:\n\nNuclear weapons are now more dangerous than ever before due to increased access to weapons of mass destruction by terrorist groups\n\nNuclear weapons have proven to be a failure in international affairs.\n\nNuclear weapons are more harmful than ever before in human history due to the increased accessibility of nuclear materials\n\n2.\n\nThesis: _The First Great Awakening_ was not caused by the preaching of the famous ministers.\n\nIntroduction: The first great awakening is considered to be one of the greatest religious movements in the history of the United States. However, as a result of poor research, people tend to believe that the famous ministers were largely responsible for the success. The focus should be put on the actual group that was considered to be a part of this religious revival the new settlers.\n\nBody paragraphs:\n\nThe new settlers believed that America was a new start in life. They believed that in this new world everything should be fair and just. They had no reason to believe that religion would fail them. They had no reason to believe that they could not live good, decent, and moral lives. This is why the new settlers did not believe that the ministers would lead them astray into believing in God. The new settlers did not have enough to believe in religion, so the ministers brought it to them. Most of them were"

I made some difficult decision that will change my life forever. The economy has forced me to move, a situation that would affect me deeply - so deeply that I would give up my passion for the sport of running. It was because of my passion for running that I decided to enter into the New York marathon. I felt that it would be a new challenge and would push me to new limits. It was a choice that I would get a lot of help and support from my friends. That the support I recieved from friends and family was so helpful would help me reach new goals. It was my support that gave me the strength to do it.\n\nThe task requires the use of the right verb tense in each sentence, to allow the reader to understand the time sequence, and a single subject for each sentence in an unrhymed, coherent piece.\n\n**Task 12-2** Your task is to create a single coherent and cohesive account of an event using no more than four sentences.\n\n  * 0-500 words\n\n  * No more than five sentences\n\n  * No more than three characters\n\n  * No quotes\n\n  * No references to other texts\n\n  * No more than one topic sentence/argument (that supports the thesis)\n\n  * No more than two sentences on one topic\n\n  * One coherent argument/thesis\n\nFor example:\n\n  * (500-700 words)\n\nYou are a parent who enjoys skiing with your family in the winter. One day you ski down an unmarked or marked hill, lose control and fall, severely injuring your leg. You're taken to the nearest emergency department, where a doctor performs emergency surgery to save your life. He places you in intensive care for two days where you experience severe pain and anxiety. With the help of doctors, nurses, and friends, you're able to recoup quickly with recovery through therapy. The next morning, you have the opportunity to walk and experience pain through your leg a few steps to express your gratitude to the medical staff, and celebrate your quick and successful recovery. You now have a stronger appreciation for good health and the health care professionals who work to keep it that way.\n\nThis example can be done about four distinct experiences. It uses no names, is written in a style that is direct (first person), and presents a clear argument/thesis.\n\n**Task 12-3** In the following text an ABD person has an A-level, but not completed a full degree. Write a paragraph about the pros and cons of taking this first step in an academic career, and whether or not it could help him/her choose the pathway to a career as a journalist.\n\nHere's a piece of text you can use to develop your first two sentences:\n\n> **_\"A-levels are important and are important for many people, but the fact that I have not completed my degree - an A-level can be seen as a major disadvantage when applying for a job. I feel more comfortable completing work because of this, even though I get better grades than people who have a degrees. To work as a journalist, I would really need to get a degree to have greater job prospects.\" \"Studying an A-level subject helped me to decide on my degree, which was an A-level in political sciences. It made me think more about different countries (which I would like to do a lot more of) and I found out some stuff about international politics. I feel more knowledge about politics will help me with my general knowledge, which I'm good at, and this is something that could make me a good candidate for a job in journalism for some reason_.\"_\n\nAnd here's how it could be done:\n\n  * 350 words - 25 words per sentence\n\n  * Five sentences - three paragraphs\n\n  * Seven different ideas\n\n  * 0 references\n\n## Write a description of how someone reacts\n\nIn your essay you can make use of a paragraph to describe how"

Many companies have rules that they enforce on their employees.\n\nA: If you are a new employee and have used up all your vacation time, you should be more than generous to give up your last and last to be taken days to your senior colleague(s).\nBut if you or other colleagues are also using up the last vacation day or two, then it's only fair for everybody to work till then and go to the beach for a few days.\nAs you can probably imagine there are many scenarios and therefore I think it's unfair to say that you have an obligation to use the first two days you got. Just keep in mind that most companies will require employees to be on vacation for at least five days (including Sundays) and that the days before and after may probably be counted again.\n\nA: This question's title seems to be, \"What options do I have if I'm being asked to give up vacation time to cover other time off?\"  With that background, your first point seems to be, \"I'm using up all of my vacation before the year is over, can I use this time to take some leave that other people have taken?\"  I have to say, that's rather odd behavior.\nUnless this is the first time you've been given leave time that you're now using, there aren't a lot of options to discuss (and the reason to do any of them will be that it's a temporary position anyway, so you don't have a lot to lose).\nIf there were a way to arrange it so that it wasn't a problem...\n\n\n*\n\n*Maybe you could set up a schedule of taking vacation time in advance (but not in excess of the actual vacation time you get).  That way you could tell the manager, \"I'm going to be taking vacation from [Date to Date] then going on vacation from [Date to Date].  On Day X of [Date], I'd be glad to cover for some of that time.\"\n(Yes, this is a bit ridiculous, especially since you're going to be on vacation when you're supposed to, but again, it might buy you some time not to be asked to give up future holidays.)\n\n\n...that would be ideal, because the manager would know that you've actually used your vacation time, which is more than any manager should expect from you.\nIf that doesn't work, then...\n\n\n*\n\n*You could offer to take on some of their vacation time at some point, since you'll be out anyways.  If that doesn't work, then...\n\n*You could agree to some kind of schedule that you agreed to be on call when needed while away, but not to be on call when you're actually away (and agree to work enough hours to cover when you're not there).  Maybe that will work.  But it might not, and this isn't worth doing either because you'll still be told to work overtime the next few weeks.\nAt that point, if you want to stick around long enough to find some other work you'l have to find the resources to deal with it.  If you're not in a position to do that, then you need to either do something with your vacation time (I agree with the other answers here that you're probably not going to be allowed to use it, but just having it in reserve could come in handy sometimes), or else find a new job that offers you better vacation time.\nIf all you're concerned about is taking care of the problem for the next month....  Just take the next month's vacation, and work your heart out.  If there are any repercussions for that, you'll find out.\n\nA: If your employer said that you're going to use all your vacation time before you leave (for which I doubt they would say such a thing if you had just started - they'd probably say you only get 2 days (as a new employee) if you're going to be with that company for more than a few months), then as long as other people don't request their vacation time back while you're on it, you're good.\nIf other people are"

Do You Want to be the Person Who is Responsible for All These Projects?\n\n### This is where things get fun.\n\n##### Your Objective\n\nThis task is a challenge. Once we provide you with a project brief and some materials (like code, assets, and resources) and then you see the project deadline creeping up on you, you suddenly realize you can't just throw together anything. You're working on a project, and it has a budget! It needs to be good and it needs to be presented in a professional manner.\n\n##### Walkthrough\n\nYou've had your first few projects rolled out before this one, right? Let's say you worked and pitched this one well, and you were paid $75. That meant $15 is yours to keep. We know what you're thinking: Maybe I should hold out for something even more professional. Maybe we should hold you back. But no! You deserve some credit just for the fact that you did the project.\n\nSo, for this one, you get to write a letter to the client. We think of it like a sales page, but even more like a prospectus, letting people know what your services are and what they'll get in return. We do encourage you to offer different packages on your list, and to charge accordingly, but what you charge for a $5,000 website will not be the same as what you charge for a $50 social media campaign.\n\nNow, what you'll write is really up to you, so we don't want to offer suggestions beyond a few pointers.\n\nJust remember to keep it short and sweet, and make sure you talk about your company's story. What are your passions and your vision? Also, what are you offering to give back to your company or to your industry?\n\nWe think that it's important to be true to yourself in these kinds of communications. It's easy to go overboard in pitching a product, but also, it's important to sell yourself and be authentic.\n\nYou wrote your email pitch, now use it to build your story.\n\n# Chapter 15-11\n\n# Project Management 101\n\nProject management is all about doing your job.\n\nWhether you're a software engineer writing a website, or a writer who is managing a podcast production, or a musician writing music for a new indie band, you still have to do the work.\n\nYou're the one who is going to write the songs or the words or the lines that the client asks for, and you're the one who is going to be accountable for your own deadlines.\n\nYou can't ask for a contract with a client unless you are prepared to sign a contract with them.\n\nYou can't send a press release and then wonder why you didn't get any responses back unless you've made sure that your address is correct and that you have a good list of media contacts on file  both of which take patience and a willingness to be proactive (which you can either get from this book or from your project manager or your boss).\n\nTo do your job well, you need to find out which tools you like and which tools you don't like, especially from the start. You may make the mistake of putting off doing any project management until you actually finish a project. Instead, you need to learn which tools and techniques work best when you get right into them and apply them to your project. This is why we give you the option in every chapter to choose between a Quick Start and Full Course. The Quick Start is just a starting point for an approach and a way to keep your project manager from nagging you too hard about your workload. The Full Course is a lot more intensive and takes a longer time to complete. You can choose the option that works best for you and your project, and then move on after you find the one that works.\n\nIn the Full Course, you can choose to do any combination of the tasks you want. If you have questions, you can also choose to go to our Help Desk for advice.\n\nOnce you have a project management strategy that works, you can try to build upon that. If you do work on one project, don't use the same strategy for the next project you have. Do you have a good sense of when to call your client or your boss? When do you find something needs a quick project update? Do you update them every week, or every day, or when something big happens? There's no \"right\" way to do this, but if you find that you want to be more efficient, you can refine your strategies.\n\n"

I was at home, with a broken thumb, but I couldn’t be left out, even from afar!\nThis is the real deal, as in it is literally Tolkien’s own text. So this is going to be huge. I’m not going to write it into my blog, but there will be a lot of buzz around it, both good and bad.\nThe “politics of WOTR” have already broken out on Goodreads. Tolkien’s politics were on the right, which is pretty much where politics are now.\nAnd the reviews are coming in now. From WotR they have: 1 out of 5 stars; 2 stars.\nI think the show’s creators (and the actors) realized that the first two episodes needed to be a bit of a toned down version of the final version of the show, to keep viewers, especially parents, interested.\nIf you didn’t read the books or weren’t familiar with the names of the characters, you’d think it was the most boring show ever, but in the final version there’s a lot of actual fight scenes, which you’d see if they’d been allowed to stay in this first 2-hour episode.\nIf you were expecting an exciting series, one where they can start to build a world of people from around the world, you’ll be very disappointed. The first 2 hours is, I think, the least exciting thing you could imagine Tolkien doing and I would not recommend watching them until the whole series is released, you won’t be able to wait to find out more in one-hour chunks.\nJust to remind you, that show is coming out on Amazon Prime on September 2 as 2 half-hour episodes.\nIf you’re in one of Amazon’s test-markets (the last I heard, it was in 20 markets, and I don’t know how big they really are) then you can see this “bonus” scene which Amazon put together for Amazon Prime members.\nI’ll be interested to know what you think of it.\nBy the way, today is a big release day for films. It’s the National Film Festival for Tiger/Leopard Conservation. The films are in English, Hindi, and Japanese.\nI don’t have much time this evening to write and say anything, so I’ll just post that one and let it serve as a reminder, and leave it to you to discover all these new and interesting things.\nIf you haven’t already, check the review of that show out. And let me know, what do you think of it after watching the bonus scenes?\nYou left the room, while I watched.\nYou will come back here soon, and you won’t remember where you were before.\nBut it will come back to you, very hard.\nIt doesn’t want to do good and you know that.\nI’m only here to do the things and watch the things.\nI’m not really a human.\nYou should have realized, but you didn’t.\nI can’t just let you go.\nIf I let you go, you would be free to see me, and then people might see me instead of you.\nI have to get rid of the part of you that knows me, and then you would be normal again.\nIt’s not really good, but it’s not evil.\nI can’t destroy myself if you’re not here to tell people I’m here. Then it would all be over.\nBut I’"

Some editors write short stories and other edited works, while others help to fix the mistakes that were made when editing. Most editors have degrees in English or writing and have spent their whole lives reading. You can make money as an editor, and if you donât like your job, you can change it. Here are some jobs you can do as an editor: â¢\tAcademic editors: Make sure that articles are in good grammar and format and have a clear writing style. These editors usually work at colleges or universities. They can make up and create a title for an article. Edit and rewrite articles to make sure that they sound professionalâ¦\nHow to be a Journalist?\nTo be a successful journalist, you need to be a writer and have good research skills. Most journalists go to school to get a degree in journalism or communications. A good example is CNN, which has 20,000 employees and needs reporters for its network. To work for CNN, someone with a bachelorâs degree can work as a web editor. You can be a journalist if you love to write, know how to research and write about what you are interested in, and can work well with people. While there is no requirement for a journalism degree, many colleges offer degrees in journalism, and you can work your way up to being a writer.\nTips for Self-publishing an E-book\nThere are many ways to make money as a professional writer. In fact, most writers make less than $1000 a year, so you could make a career. You can get a book published by writing a manuscript. Most self-publishing companies charge a fee and offer you help in order to publish your book. If you want to self-publish and have a specific book idea in mind, then you should do research to find out if it would be a good idea and what kind of book you want to write. There are lots of different e-books, so itâs important to choose one that fits your style and your audience. You can decide what kind of content you want to write about as well as the title that will be your book. You might choose to write a book about a different part of your life or business that youâre interested in. Once youâve figured out what kind of book you want to write, you can get help with the publishing process. You can publish your book online and sell it on Amazon or Ebay. If you have multiple titles, you can make them available as a series.\nSteps to Becoming a Fiction Writer\nIf you like to write on the computer and donât mind spending a little money, you can make money as a freelance writer. Most editors will pay you to write books or stories for them. Some freelance writers get paid weekly or monthly, and others get paid per item. If you want to work as a writer to make money, there are several things to consider. You need to pay attention to the way your readers read, be able to write well, and have the creativity needed to come up with an original idea. If you canât do all three, you canât be a writer, and you should try to find another job. For example, if you love to read but hate to"

A good example is in python, it is very easy to find python courses.\nThere are also so many YouTube videos on programming, you can find them too by searching the keywords on YouTube.\nIf you want to self-learn the programming theory like object-oriented programming, then a good book is a must.\nAnd last but not the least, you should also learn how to code properly. If you are new to programming, it is a good thing to learn how to write code correctly. You often can see that some of those programmers are not actually professional, so they make a lot of mistakes. So, to be better you should be able to fix the things yourself. You will not be professional programmer if you keep making lots of mistakes with your code.\nSome code that you wrote before can also be very good, so if you can improve it by adding more functionalities, that’s even better. But, if you have the problems, at the beginning of your programming learning journey, you can get help from the beginners forums on codebunk.\nSo, what do you think? Is it worth learning to code?

Use the following string. If there's more than one way to generate a code snippet, you should make a separate question for each approach.\n```python\nfor i in range(0, 5):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n- Code for creating a list of random integers (1 to 5). (a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] using random numbers)\n```python\nimport random\n\nx = list()\nfor i in range(0, 5):\n    x.append(random.randint(1, 5))\n    print(x)\n\n```\n\n- Code for creating a list of random letters and words (with a maximum size of 8 characters).\n\n```python\nletters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', \n'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', \n'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\n\na = ''.join(random.choices(letters, k=8))\n\n```\n\n### Pseudocode\n- Write a pseudocode for the same code snippet from looping examples.\n\n- Write a pseudocode for an algorithm for finding the first number where the digit sum and triple product are equal.

For example, search for all content in a folder \"test\" with the length between 5 and 10. \n\n### Comments and Indentations\n- Add comments with your pseudocode using a markdown comment. \n\n- Use a proper indentation in pseudocode. The code should be indented by four spaces, and every if statement(for example is should be indented by four spaces). Comment the file before the file start in the same line. \n\n### Comments and Comments\n- Add a comment about the algorithm.\n\n- One comment to explain the pseudocode. \n\n- Write a detailed comment to explain the pseudocode using English. \n\n- Write an English comment for that code snippet. \n\n- And add another comment using a markdown to explain the \"for\" loop (for example, what range(i:j) means). \n\n### Practice and Learn\n- Go to youtube.com and search for \"[Python for Beginners by CodeSchool](URL\" and watch the video. \n\n- Go to URL and read the article about Python. \n\n- Watch this [youtube video](URL\n  \n  \n### Useful Sources\n- [StackOverflow](URL\n- [Hacker News](URL\n- [Github](URL\n- [Programing Puzzel](URL"

For longer messages, consider using a file format such as .pdf, .doc, or .docx. Consider the following example: A business uses a standard message template to share information with their customers. For example, an e-mail from the Human Resources department notifies employees of their upcoming vacation.The message is sent to all employees in the company, which may have a maximum of 500 employees. As the employee count is relatively static, you can adjust the required length of the message by adjusting the line spacing and font size.To calculate the required number of characters, divide the line spacing (ex: 0.5 inch) by the width (ex: 76.0 inches). Then multiply that result by the height of the font (ex: 14-point) and the height of the type size (ex: 14-point). Then add that total to the total number of words to calculate the required number of characters.To make the e-mail message 48 characters per line, divide 0.5 by 76.0 (22 characters per line). Then multiply that line length by the font size and the type size to get 48 characters.\nUsing the preceding example, the required number of words is 28 words to fit on an e-mail of 500 characters. If the Human Resources department has an e-mail message that requires more than 500 characters, then you need to adjust the line spacing and type size. To adjust the e-mail message size, keep the number of characters at 500 and change the line spacing and type size accordingly.Example: An e-mail from the Human Resources department notifies all employees that their vacation starting the fourth week of October.In this scenario, the total number of words required is 44 words (48-4=44). To fit this many words onto the screen, you would need to adjust the line spacing and font size to 20-point Times New Roman and use a line spacing of 20-point.\nHow long is a MS Word Document?\nA Microsoft Word document does not have a maximum length. To send a document to someone who does not have Microsoft Word, convert the Microsoft Word document to a plain text file using the File > Save as option.For more information, see Confidentiality Issues for Word Document with Long Length.\nHow long is an average Word document?\nOn a typical computer monitor a typical document is around 11 wide and around 8 high. A 16 point font would be .89591124 inches wide and .71875 inches high. Thats around 8048 characters. A simple multiplication equation to determine the number of pages is to divide the length of the document by the average height the document will be on the screen.\nFor example, on a good-sized desk, you might have an average height of 22 (thats a pretty good guess considering desk monitors average 21 inches). So 8048 divided by 22 is 363.2 characters per page.\nHow to Use a Word Document\nWhat are three ways to enter text into Word document?\nYou can"

        "output": "Design a soothing pastel color palette for your slides. Pastel colors generally come across as pretty and delicate, so you’ll want to make sure your presentation calls for a similar mood. Choose up to five colors or color codes.\nInclude one illustration to add personality to your slides. Illustrating your slides will help you stand out from the crowd, so don’t worry if it doesn’t immediately make sense to you. Your illustration can be created from scratch or you can use an existing design.\nChoose a catchy headline to introduce your main topic. Highlight your headline to catch your audience’s eyes.\nPresent your main topic next. It is a good idea to use one of the colors you selected to create a header that makes the title the most noticeable element on your slides. A large color header will help make sure you speak loud and clear when you go over your main topic.\nAdd a few sections of small items to fill in the empty space. You can pick five or six items to show. You don’t need to add every item you have. Consider only adding items from your main topic. For example, you don’t need to include five items about how to keep a dog, then five items about how to keep a cat. Just choose the five top dog and cat topics.\nMake sure to add each item into the appropriate section. For example, if your slide’s main topic is “How to Play the Drums”, you might put your illustration in the main topic section, your header in the headline section, your first section on the drum kit, another section on where to find drumsticks, another section on the different types of drums.\nMake sure each title fits under its own section if you want to use images with your headers. A good way to test it is if the image would only show up in the next slide, then don’t use an image, just have a space above the next heading in your list.\nIt’s good to write a lot of your speech and then use your presentation to highlight your points. If you want to add extra detail into your speech that you don’t want to be put into your presentation, you can add images or notes to keep the presentation organized or just make sure you make a good flow of your slides from one slide to the next.\nYou can put a few items together under the main topic. For example, add a section on how to find the best dog food, then have a section on how to find the best cat food, then have a section on animals that aren’t cats or dogs because you don’t want to take up the main topic.\nMake sure to fill out your speech if you want it to go too long. You might want to add more items or write more about what you will speak at each section.\nStart each section with an interesting and relevant item. Don’t start with something useless like “what’s your name?” Instead, you can start on a funny story you heard, a great quote, and so on.\nIt might be a good idea to start off with something simple, like a drawing of a dog. Then you can use that as your main topic. If you want to get into an important topic like animal rights, maybe start with something minor like how to choose the best dog food.\nYou can do an experiment each time on each slide of your presentation. You can always experiment with your slides by changing the typeface to make it smaller and rearranging the information to see how the images look from different points, but this will get time consuming fast.\nThis is only if you have the time.\nYou can find some of your own slides online. When you open up a presentation online, you could copy the information together to create your own presentation. This is an easy way to save time and money. If you just want to keep up with your studies, you can do this by visiting one of the websites listed at the end of this article.\nThe easiest way to create your presentation is to download some of the websites already made or look at our link to Microsoft Powerpoint, which will allow you to create your own. See below for some good sites where you can get your presentation all done for you. Remember to keep an eye out and make some of your own changes though. For example, if you found a presentation made by someone else, you could rearrange the order of sections, or change and add up-to-date information, or add original data.\nAfter you have decided on what information you want, now you need to organize and make your points clear and succinct. To do so, you will need to organize your information depending on what you want to present first, what you want most important or central, and then what you are covering second-hand. In doing so, you will help to make your presentation understandable, comprehensible, and to help your audience to follow along with you, which will aid your audience to understand"

        "output": "Find sentences from reliable sources such as the Guardian or Forbes that contain the exact match for the given sentence or phrase. Also, mention the source of each sentence.\n\nThere are great options to use while generating the list of sentences:\n\n`-l <count>` to generate a fixed number of sentences.\n\n`-r <rate>` to generate sentences in a fixed rate.\n\n`-s <sentence count>` to generate a list of sentences that fit the given count.\n\n\n### Create Nested Sentence Lists\n\nBy default, the sentence generator is aware only about phrases. It means that a set of sentences can only create a phrase. To avoid this limitation, you should generate sentence lists, which use sentence patterns generated from a source.\n\nThis way, to use the sentence generator, you have to follow:\n\n  * Generate patterns from a source.\n\n  * Generate sentence sets from patterns created in the previous step.\n\n  * Generate sentence lists from the sentence set.\n\n  * Read the generated sentence list.\n\nPlease see detailed sample code below:\n\n{% highlight python %}\n    # Generate patterns:\n    patterns = phrase_generator.generative_sentence_patterns()\n\n    # Generate sentence sets from pattern:\n    sentence_set = sentence_generator.generate_set('I <pattern> my <pattern> and <pattern>'\n                                                   f'My <pattern>'\n                                                   f'I <pattern> <pattern> <pattern> my <pattern> and <pattern> and'\n                                                   f'I bought <pattern> my <pattern>'\n                                                   f'I <pattern> <pattern> my <pattern> and <pattern>'\n                                                   f'I <pattern> <pattern>'\n                                                   f'I <pattern> <pattern>'\n                                                   f'I <pattern> <pattern> my <pattern>'\n                                                   f'I <pattern> <pattern> <pattern> buy <pattern>'\n                                                   f'I <pattern>', patterns)\n\n    # Generate a sentence list with words from the sentence set:\n    sentences = sentence_generator.generate_sentences('sentences')\n\n    # Read sentences list and check its size:\n    assert len(sentences) == 61, 'Some words are wrong!

However, you can use the sentence generator, directly from your language or any programming in one of these ways:\n\n  * Reading sentences from files.\n\n  * Calling the python script directly from any programming.\n\n  * Using python libraries like **[Flask](URL [Web2py](URL [Django](URL [Node.js](URL and others to use sentences and patterns.\n\n### Sample Reading Sentences from Files\n\nPlease see the following script:\n\n{% highlight python %}\n{% raw %}\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nfrom string import strip\n\n\ndef download_sentences():\n    \"\"\"Download sentences from the generator:\"\"\"\n"

        "output": "You will be asked to answer the following question as part of the LinkedIn Skill assessments.\n\nYou find that your project has a tag and branch both named push-notifications, which causes confusion when trying to print out given reference. How can you specify which branch you want to look at?\n\nA. git log --notify-branch=push-notifications\n\nB. git log --notify-tag=push-notifications\n\nC. git log --branch=push-notifications\n\nD. git log --tag=push-notifications\n\n## A. git log --notify-branch=push-notifications\n\n**A:** This option would look at the tag, or branch, associated with the branch or tag you're querying. In this case, you're looking for the branch named push-notifications.\n\n## B. git log --notify-tag=push-notifications\n\n**B:** This option would look for reference that matches the tag and branch push-notifications. The options for this command accept either a tag or branch name from the git config file.\n\n## C. git log --branch=push-notifications\n\n**C:** This option queries the branch list, but only for a given branch. The branch parameter has no special notation options.\n\n## D. git log --tag=push-notifications\n\n**D:** The correct answer is C because the git command for this question would show you the list of tags or branches you have configured on your repository. The option for tag has special notation options.\n\n### 2.2.5.7. git diff and merge\n\nThe git diff command will generate a diff file that shows how two different commits could differ in terms of what is actually saved to the repository.\n\nIt is handy for comparing a given branch with a commit, or vice versa, to check on changes. You can ask git to show only the differences between the current file and the previous commit, and even limit the amount of information produced. Here are a few of the more common git diff commands you want to know.\n\n**git diff**\n\ngit diff prints a diff between the working directory and the index, and the index and the working directory. By default, it will show the results in a two-column format. It will list out each line and its status, based on whether the line appears in the working directory but not in the index, in the index but not the working directory, or in both directories.\n\nIt will also display unmodified lines with a **M**. If you ask git to display just the patch (default is **M** ), it will give you a list of files that it thinks could be fixed with a git diff --patch .\n\nTo give you an example of this command in action, try the following:\n\n    **$ git diff master develop**\n\nThis command will show what has changed between the master branch and develop. You might see something like this:\n\n    **$ git diff master develop**\n    diff --git a/index.php b/index.php\n    index d38d44c..53e4082 100644\n    --- a/index.php\n    +++ b/index.php\n    @@ -1 +1 @@\n    -echo \"this will be deleted.. but is not\";\n    +echo \"this will be deleted.. but is not\";\n    -echo \"only the changes\";\n    -echo \"in this file\";\n    +echo \"only the changes\";\n    +echo \"in this file\";\n    diff --git a/index2.php b/index2.php\n    index b3b008e..0719be0 100644\n    --- a/index2.php\n    +++ b/index2.php\n    @@ -1 +1 @@\n    -echo \"this will be deleted.. but is not\";\n    +echo \"this will be deleted.. but is not\";\n    -echo \"only the changes\";\n    -echo \"in this file\";\n    +echo \"only the changes\";\n    +echo \"in this file\";\n\nWhat this is telling you is that there has been a deletion that would have affected the actual code written in index.php as well as an addition that has been made to index2.php.\n\nYou can also specify two patches to be applied to a diff, like so:\n\n    **$ git diff master develop "

There are better ways to tell a good story. Suppose you were to think of your previous advertising experience as part of a larger project: the advertising campaign for your own business. How would that help you in a sales position?\n\nYou could say in that case that when you made sales calls for yourself or worked events, you learned to think creatively about your clients' business needs. You also learned how to listen well and be sensitive to others' feelings. How has that translated to your work as a salesperson?\n\nIf you want to talk about your work experience in detail, there are many ways to make it more interesting than simply describing what you did, how much progress you've made, and so on. The key is to tell a story or make a point, instead of just talking about what you did. Here are some useful tips for using stories:\n\n  *   **Ask questions.** If you want your responses to draw the most out of your interviewer, don't just give answers. Ask open-ended questions that encourage a conversation. Why? Because an interview is two-way business! At least, to some degree, it should be.\n\nFor example, if one of your interviewer's questions is \"Talk to me about your experience as a salesperson.\" (This is a nice example of a \"descriptive\" question with an invitation to \"give me an example of...\" after it.)\n\nInstead of saying \"I've done a lot of sales and marketing, and I'd love to tell you about it,\" talk the interview back. Ask, \"When we were talking earlier, you mentioned you're looking for a sales team member whose job is doing cold-calling and generating leads for our product. Do you have any ideas for what kind of personality would be right for this kind of work?\"\n\nYou are offering an answer to the interviewer's question while asking for input on _his_ answer, which is a wonderful way to get the interviewer talking and more likely to lead to a positive result.\n\n  *   **Make a point.** Once you've talked about yourself, make a statement and build on it. A statement should leave the interviewer with a question in mind. If the interviewer asks about it, then you'll get the chance to continue talking about this. You can also frame a comment with an example or anecdote, as in the example above.\n\nFor example, if I say to the interviewer \"My work ethic is great, and as you know from today's interview, I'm very self-motivated, which often means I do work late, even over the weekends.\" (My statement is \"I'm a hard worker,\" I've just made a point and will probably be asked to expand further on the discussion.)\n\nThen I follow up with, \"What do you think about my work ethic?\" This builds on the idea brought forward in the statement and provides the opportunity to continue talking about my work ethic.\n\nIf the interviewer has an opinion, I get to hear it. If he's hesitant, I get to hear that, too. If he has nothing to say and isn't feeling comfortable to say anything about me, the end of the interview may be near. I can ask if I've addressed the issue he's interested in. This gives me a chance to say something else and leave the interview on a positive tone.\n\n## Ways to Build Memorable Stories that Show Off Your Strengths\n\n* * *\n\nHere's how you might use your skills to make a stronger statement.\n\nFirst, think about the strengths of those qualities that have developed naturally in you. Then think about them as a set of skills that someone might want to have."

The first line contains the description about the class, the second the definition, and the third line contains all the values (from 11 to N + 1) for the attribute.\n\nWhen you open the file in a text editor, you'll see that the values in the file are different each time, because each time GUS requires a new Manifest.mcf file. In this file, you'll find all the data for each class you define for the next movie you want to analyze.\n\nI've changed this file and I will tell you how in the next few minutes.\n\n### Instructing GUS to Analyze the Movie with Genre\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to specify all the movies you want to analyze with GUS. The first column of the file contains the movie ID. You can either use the ID provided by IMDb or you can give a new one. The second column is the name of the movie you want to analyze. Finally, in the third column I've indicated the country of production for each movie.\n\nI suggest that you use the information already available in IMDb when you write the file. Just remember to indicate each movie ID in all the columns and in the other columns include the movie name in the third column and the two-letter country that refers to the country of production in the fourth column.\n\n### Instructing GUS to Analyze the Movies With Genre in the Movies.txt File\n\nTo instruct GUS to get the information about the genre from the movies.txt file you have to create a new manifest file (Manifest2.mcf) in the manifest directory. As I will show you in the next sections, GUS uses the genre information from the movies.txt file to analyze movies in the movies folder. To get the genre information, GUS needs to know how many movies are stored in the folder and which genre they fall into.\n\nThe manifest file contains the same data, and I'll show you how to create it so that you can start analyzing the first episode you'd like to analyze.\n\n##### Finding All the Movies in the Movies Folders for GUS to Analyze\n\nWhen you open GUS, you're taken back to the main window, where you can select the files you want to analyze as shown in Figure 3-7.\n\nFigure 3-7.\n\nMovies Analysis  Manifest File  Folders\n\nThe first thing you need to do is create a new file titled Movies.  txt. Remember that GUS will ask for the path of the file where you want to store the text file.\n\n##### The Movies.txt File to Manage Movies\n\nNow that you have the movies folder with 12 movies in all, you can get their information and manage how they are organized during the analysis.\n\nThere is a command that allows you to extract the file names for all the movies you have in the given movies folder: type get filename.\n\nWhen you open this new file in Windows Notepad, you can see that you have 12 names for the movies, as shown in Figure 3-8.\n\nFigure 3-8.\n\n12 movies with their names in the Movies.txt file in Notepad\n\nThe next thing to do is to organize the movies in a way that's easy to understand. To do this, you can type some keywords in the same file to group the movies as a family and their sub-series as a subfamily, or you can create another file titled Family Movies. To start, create a new file.\n\nYou need to create the first file because the next step requires you to analyze the first movie from the movies.txt file. This task is done in the next section of this chapter.\n\n##### Creating a Family of Movies\n\nFirst, I'll create the family, which will be used to group the 12 movies together. This step is the first step in the analysis. The data will be used by GUS to identify the subcategories. After that, it will be easier to create the subcategories. The next step is to create a group for the family and then create the sub-family because the family must be created in advance. This is the way of managing your own personal files when you want to create sub-categories to make movies more recognizable and findable. GUS stores"

Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?\n\nA: First of all, I would like to ask you if you can solve the issue on your own before you take this step. There could be many reasons for this.\nFirst of all, are you doing anything that could be construed as ruining your trip or having any real bad habits that would be ruining your trip by yourself?\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you have a bad attitude while traveling?\n\n*Do you have bad habits while traveling (smoking, eating garbage food, lying, stealing, etc.)?\n\n*Are you bringing all this negative energy to the trip?\n\n\nCould the issue be with you?\nI would like to point out that if there is something you really want from me, you won't need to say anything at all, because I don't need to ask and I believe you could tell just by looking at me and just by having a little bit more presence.\nI would think the most important thing to do here is, after you have established that this issue is really with your friend and not with you, is be honest.\nIn addition, it seems like you feel like you are getting a lot of negative attention so what you need to do is to communicate with this person in an honest and open way.\nIt is very important to establish a good relationship with this individual because you want to build trust with him/her.\nYou should try to help your friend communicate his/her feelings. \nTry to make the conversation more focused and less about the issue/topic of tension.\nHave a positive mindset as well, don't dwell on negative feelings towards your friend.\nIf your friend is a very negative person and constantly bringing down the mood, how to approach this individual?\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to find out what this person's motivations are for being negative/negative energy. If this person is depressed, have a conversation with him/her on how they can see past their issue\n\n*The conversation shouldn't only focus on the negative energy though, you could also have conversations about other things that are positive that you both enjoy\n\n\nIf this isn't working and the person just doesn't want to talk about anything positive or is just being negative, how would you go on alone?\n\nA: In the case where you are getting negative vibes from someone, I would suggest: \nStep 1: Take a deep breath in and exhale slowly. Do this in your own time until you feel comfortable. \nStep 2: Imagine yourself going to a safe place in your mind like your childhood home and having a conversation with a beloved person in your life. Be specific, like Grandma or Uncle or best friend. \nStep 3: Tell them that you want to get away and that you need some time to yourself. Remind them that your being a good friend and telling them the truth, which they will understand if that is who they are. \nStep 4: Start to formulate your plan for going away (you might need to do this on your own). \nStep 5: Go back to your safe place in your mind and thank them for listening and understanding. \nStep 6: Follow up with an apology for causing them some discomfort that they had to accept. \nStep 7: Now you can go out into the world having worked through this problem and feeling more confident moving forward. \nIn the case where you are feeling like you are ruining someone's trip, I would suggest: \nStep "

The circumstances remain unclear and are currently the subject of a police investigation. At one of the demonstrations, an African-American woman told the media that she had tried to stop the officer who shot her young nephew, only to be arrested.\n\nIn response to the incident, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed into law the “Anti-Anarchist Law,” which prohibits protests that disrupt “business and transportation, cause damage, or obstructs officers from performing their duties.” On July 31, 2020, officers were met by anti-government protestors when they arrived to service a warrant at an apartment housing African Americans and the media, who had been told that it was a residence for the homeless. When asked to wait outside until the warrant was executed, the officers were attacked by protesters with bottles and rocks, and were forced to use pepper spray and stun guns in self-defense. A confrontation ensued between the police and the media, which then escalated with the arrival of additional officers. Two officers were shot during the melee. One, Christopher Allen, a five-year veteran who had been on the police force for only two days, was killed. The other, 27-year-old Aaron Ray Smith, suffered injuries to his arm and back and survived.

For the term \"TF\", it means the number of times that the term appears in the corpus. This word 'term' can be a word or a phrase.*\n\n*For the term \"IDF\" in topic modelling, it is a number between 0 and 1. It means the logarithm of the number of documents containing the term as inverse of the number of documents containing the term.*\n\n*For the term \"TF-IDF\", it is a number between 0 and 1. It means the product of TF and IDF.*\n\n*When we use those terms, we will need a corpus. A corpus means a collection of documents with word-level data.*\n\n*When we use TF-IDF, how should we choose the term? Should we choose the term used for TF and IDF? or is there a better way to choose terms (not to use IDF)?*\n\n*For example, we have 10,000 docs in the corpus. If we want to use TF-IDF, will we have to calculate TF-IDF for each document, so that each document will have TF/IDF pair? or can we calculate TF once, IDF once, and TF-IDF just once?*\n\n*It seems that I can use tf-idf directly in my model to weight the terms. So, is that it? Is there a better way to do it?*\n\n*Why do we need TF/IDF before we use it in our model?*\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis\n\n1. You said that there is $O(n^4)$.

        "output": "Considering the reason for the rejection, write a polite rejection letter for rejecting a candidate.\n\nReason: You came in second, but you did not qualify.\n\nReject the candidate.\n\n## 5-2. How to Apply with a Self-Rejection Letter\n\nA self-rejection letter is a rejection letter sent from the candidate to the employer. When applying to multiple companies, a candidate will usually send one rejection letter to all the companies that rejected him or her.\n\n### Situations in Which You May Need to Send a Self-Rejection Letter\n\n  * You rejected the candidate.\n  * You got in touch with the rejected candidate and asked for an update on their employment status. If they have been placed elsewhere, provide some form of recognition that you took action against them, and inform them that you plan to send a letter of praise toward the hiring company.\n  * You need to apply in the future to the same company.\n\nHere is how you should draft a self-rejection letter. After you draft the self-rejection letter, add an outline of your employment history, and the date of the letter.\n\n## Sample Self-Rejection Letter\n\n> | \n> \n> Dear [Name of Company],  \n>   \n> ---|---  \n>   \n>  My name is [Your name]. I was previously a candidate in your recruitment. It seems that I did not obtain a job on March 5, 20xx, and we could not move forward with the interview on March 6, 20xx. I understand and respect your reason for refusing to hire me. However, I must admit that the job was highly attractive and could have gone to another person who was also looking for a job. I believe that you may be interested in my resume. It is important for me to mention that in my previous experiences, I was able to be of great value to my companies' growth and success. I would like to receive an update on your recruitment process, as I am still looking to find a proper place to work.\n> \n> Thank you,   \n> [Your name]\n\n# CHAPTER 6\n\nWhat You Should Know Before Sending a Rejection Letter to a Candidate\n\n## 6-1. How to Know the Rejection Reason\n\nIf a candidate rejects his or her rejection for employment, what form of compensation will the employer be required to pay? What should the employer do and not do? Before sending a rejection letter to a candidate, it is important to be clear about the following issues.\n\n## What to Do\n\n  * Send a letter of acknowledgment.\n  * Send a compensation package.\n  * Send a termination package.\n\n## What Not to Do\n\n  * Send an empty letter.\n  * Send the same letter to all candidates.\n\n### Sample Rejection Letter Sample 1\n\nDear [Given name]:\n\nThe reason for my rejection for employment was as follows: I came in second. You have been notified that you do not qualify for the position.\n\nI understand that you might believe that you deserved the job, but the decision was mine.\n\nI shall contact you with further information regarding compensation for your interview time on March 6, 20xx.\n\nRegards,   \nName\n\n### Sample Rejection Letter Sample 2\n\nDear [Given names]:\n\nWe thank you for your application, but we have decided to hire someone else for the position.\n\nThank you for your time and cooperation.\n\nSincerely yours,  \nName\n\n### Sample Rejection Letter Sample 3\n\nDear [Given name]:\n\nAlthough we were pleased with your qualification package, we made our selection from among the qualified applicants in the order of your application.\n\nI will take the time to explain the selection process to you, as well as the selection method. We will be contacting candidates from first to last, but we do not require candidates to be interviewed in order.\n\nThank you for taking the time to apply for this position, and I look forward to speaking with you again in the future.\n\nSincerely yours,  \nName\n\n## 6-2. When to Send a Letter of Recognition\n\nThe question of when to give a recognition is still the subject of much debate, but the conclusion is that you should give it to the candidate within two weeks of having sent him or her a rejection letter for employment. The ideal situation is to give the compensation package within a week. The following are some issues to be cognizant of.\n\n## When to Send a Letter of Recognition\n\n  * After sending a rejection letter for employment, which is your own form of rejection toward the candidate.\n  * Before a candidate finds a job elsewhere.\n  "

And I'm not gonna let you do that to me.\"\n\nI look around at the rest of the traffic going to the traffic light and say \"You know we could just turn around and go back home and try again tomorrow\".

        "output": "Design an outline for a blog post based on the given information and list the sections accordingly.\n\nThis blog post is going to about making a list of last-minute gift ideas. Also, the tone of the post is going to be relaxed and casual.\n\nThe post consists of an opening statement, some information, and then several suggestions for something to do. The next piece of advice is also about a couple of resources to use, and then the piece concludes with where the person in the audience is located. So, let’s break it down.\n\n## Opening Statement\n\nWelcome all. My name is Mary Mary. Today, I am here to talk to you about making a list of last-minute gift ideas. Before I get started, I want to thank you so much for allowing me to be here. What I have prepared is not just something for you, my dear listener. There are a thousand ways to come up with an idea for a gift for your friends and family this time of year, and I am here to share mine with you. I would like to say that this idea is going to come from the heart, but I am not one to try to be too poetic with my words.\n\nLet’s get started. How often have you been in a conversation with a very close friend or relative who is in search of a meaningful gift? Well, let’s take a second here to just stop and reflect. How often have you been in that situation?\n\nThe way this sounds is as if the person in the conversation is putting pressure on you to come up with the next great idea for a gift. But it’s also important to look at their situation. It’s usually not their fault. They are not the one trying to find the last-minute gift, right? That should remind you how hard it is for someone in that situation to find a gift that will be perfect.\n\nJust keep reading.\n\n## About the Gift\n\nThere are a lot of things that you could think of if it comes to finding a gift this late in the season. One that I find to be very meaningful is to find a gift that includes something small for yourself.\n\nBut let me take a moment to backtrack a bit. You see, I don’t try to make my suggestions for last-minute gift ideas into hard and fast rules. I have learned that it is important to listen to the people you care about. In the end, it is you as the gift giver who should choose the gift that they like and that they will use. After all, it is your job to give them the gift that is right for them.\n\nBut for now, you should try to make what the person needs part of the equation of what you are thinking of doing. I usually try to think about these last-minute gift ideas based on someone’s needs. So, the more you know about what the other person loves or needs, the better.\n\nIf you are thinking about something to do in this situation here, here are a couple of hints for you.\n\n## The First Suggestion\n\nI have found that sometimes there are small things that people don’t get a chance to do because they are too busy. They are also afraid of failing, not being good enough, or doing it wrong. But I would like to tell you that it’s not that hard to just have a go at something new. So, here’s a great idea: take a class together.\n\n## A Second Suggestion\n\nThere is also another way to make this gift and that is through experiences. Experiences are nice gifts. Experiences and activities make us happier because we remember the times we had together. It’s a gift. When you go on an adventure or make new things happen, you are building up those little moments of beauty, and they will be there for you when you need them.\n\nI don’t want you to think that I am trying to say that you shouldn’t spend money on last-minute gift ideas. My friend and I once had a great time going on a trip together, but we didn’t have much money to spend on a trip. We planned one on our budget.\n\n## The Third Suggestion\n\nIf you have this problem in your mind, here are some ways you can have an adventure right now. I am sure that your friend will appreciate the gift, and you will enjoy it, too.\n\nYou don’t always have to wait until you find the perfect thing that you want to give someone. If you want to give someone a gift, you can always find something small to give them.\n\n## Related Resources\n\nIf you are feeling like you could use some advice to create your own last-minute gift ideas, then I want to recommend two sites to check out right away.\n\nThe first one is called [Sellfy](URL and it is an online"

        "output": "Write a section for a blog post and try to cover all of the provided information about this section in your text.\n\nBlog Topic: 7 Fall Fashion Trends Worth Taking on Your Trip\nSection Title: Trusty Jeans\nMain point of the section: jeans can be worn all year and look good with everything .\nBody: Jeans are a staple of American culture, even more so in a country based on “The American Dream”. They were made to be worn as working clothing during the Industrial Revolution, but now are worn for comfort and style. They’re practical. The right pair will last through rain, mud, snow and anything else in between. To get the most wear and love out of jeans, follow the rule of thumb to choose the right fit.\n\n### Style\n\nWhat is the size of my hips and butt? Measure your backside.\n\nFit tip #1: Look in the mirror and pinch the crotch seam to determine the break line. This is the point at which the jeans give way and start to fall off. If it is too short, you’re too short. Too long and you’re too tall. Adjust accordingly.\n\nFit tip #2: Don’t sit down. Find your hip to hip size and the waist line—the smaller the number, the smaller the waist—at a tailor, jeans store or in a retail store.\n\nFit tip #3: When looking for the right pair of jeans, be honest with yourself. “If you’re a size 14, get a 14, not a 12,” says <NAME>, founder of <NAME>, a high-end denim retailer. “You know that they’re never going to look as good on you as they do for your size 8 girlfriend. She’s going to look like a supermodel.” <NAME>, vice president of the United Nations Development Programme, has a different approach—he just wears 13’s. “I think you should use your body as it is,” he says. “If your jeans are cut to fit your body, they will be great.”\n\nFit tip #4: Never buy your jeans online, especially if you need an odd size. When you feel in love with a pair, buy them and bring them along to try them on when you head out of town. That way you’ll be sure you love them for your destination and not just the one style you happened to try on during the week.\n\nFit tip #5: Denim should hug your shape. Wearing jeans when you’re sitting or lying down will help you to make the right decision. “Buy your jeans on the side of your chair,” says <NAME>, an architect in Atlanta, Georgia. “If they look good, you’re good to go.”\n\n### Design\n\n1. Fit\n2. Color\n3. Style\n4. Stretch or natural denim\n5. Fit\n6. Cut\n7. Size & Color\n8. Style\n9. Fabric\n10. Design\n\nIn order to ensure that you find the right jeans, start by looking at the design. The first thing to notice is whether the pants are “stained with tears and holes”. Don’t just take in the entire pants—focus on the right area. “The crotch is very important,” <NAME>, a designer for <NAME>, tells us. “The seat and the leg openings must be perfect.” Another detail to look at is the cut. The way in which the jeans can affect different types of bodies. “In the thighs there are different cuts,” explains <NAME>, “sometimes flared, sometimes straight. It’s a must to find the right style, because no one can be in the same style.” Finally, don’t forget about the texture. The last thing to look at is the material and the quality. “A real pair of jeans isn’t made of denim with a lot of stretch. They’re very fine,” Maccarano says. “It’s not possible to stretch.”\n\n## Research\n\nThe research you need for your trip depends in the country or city which you are visiting. All of the information you will need is available online for each nation.\n\n- Check the weather\n- Check the flight options\n- Check travel advisories\n- Check your destination's local laws\n- Read local culture guides\n- Understand history and tradition\n- Look in to the popular activities/sightseeing opportunities\n- Determine what is your transportation method (train, car, boat, plane, etc.)\n\nThe research you have done should provide you with the following:\n\n- Flight times\n- Flight cost\n- Flight itinerary\n- Transportation options (cabs, trains, buses)\n- Your hotel or bed & breakfast reservations\n- Weather forecasts—if"

        "output": "Use appropriate emojis to convey the meaning in the given text.\n\nCute cat\nplayful\nSoft fur\npaws and tongue\n\nHow to test this method:\n\nMy method is not suitable in the following cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*No punctuation in between sentences\n\n*Sentences don't contain enough words to get unique emojis\n\n\nA: Here is my simple implementation using the @kenny70 approach:\n(1) Extract phrases from sentences by split using Space.\n(2) Collect unique emoji by groupBy with Emoji.\n   (3) Map group items by collect into a list of a single emoji.\nList<String> emojis =\n    text.split(StringUtils.SPACE)\n           .stream()\n           .map(s -> Emoji.get(s))\n           .flatMap(Collection::stream)\n           .distinct()\n           .map(Collection::toArray)\n           .collect(toList());\n\nThere is a limitation since it does not handle cases where you write a sentence such as \"He ______ a dog\". That is, he is not able to extract the - sign into the same group, though you can use a set of words without a separator.\nYou will need to replace all of your empty lists and space with spaces to be able to handle such cases.\n\nA: I would create a very deep recursive function, that checks, for each token:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the token an emoji?\n\n*If the token is not an emoji: Is it punctuation or a word? (word)\n\n*If the token is punctuation or a word (word), does it start the sentence? (no, and only the first)\n\n*\n\n*Break recursion (if it's punctuation)\n\n\n\nI would use this function to create a list of possible emojis per line, and then filter to get the one that has the most occurrences\n\nA: So for this one I would just simply use a String tokenizer and then iterate through all the tokens. Then with the help of Pattern.compile(\"[pP]unctuation|\"+\"\\\\W[oO]ld|[yY]ou|the|a|the|and|or|but|because|as|if|for|in|into|out|up|down|of|on|is|to|at|with|and|like|as|[^.]+?\")) I would add every one in the pattern list. Then when I'm done all I have to do is take out the punctuation and add each to my emoji list. \nFor example:\nString emojiList = \"\";\nString[] sentenceArray = \"He laughed at the cat.\".replace(\".\", \"\").replace(\":\", \"\").split(\"\\\\s+\");\n\n    for(String sentenceToken: sentenceArray) {\n\n        // Iterate through the sentenceArray and add emojis to list\n\n        String newSubSentence = \"\";\n        for (String emoji: sentenceToken.split(Tokenizer.PUNCTUATION_REGEX_PLUS_PATTERNS)) {\n        if(emoji.equals(Tokenizer.PUNCTUATION_REGEX) || Pattern.compile(\"[pP]unctuation|\"+\"\\\\W[oO]ld|[yY]ou|the|a|[^.]+?\".toCharArray()[0]).matcher(emoji).matches() || emoji == Tokenizer.PUNCTUATION_REGEX) continue;\n        else newSubSentence += emoji + Tokenizer.SPACE;\n        }\n        if(newSubSentence.length() == 0) continue;\n        newSubSentence = newSubSentence.substring(0, newSubSentence.length() - Tokenizer.SPACE.length());\n        sentenceArray[sentenceArray.length() - 1] += newSubSentence;\n\n        //If it's not punctuation add to list\n        if(newSubSentence.substring(0, newSubSentence.length() - Tokenizer.SPACE.length()).replaceAll(Tokenizer.SPACE, \"\").trim().contains(\" \")== false) {\n        emojiList += Tokenizer.LIGHT_PUNCTUATION_SINGLE + Tokenizer.SPACE;\n        continue; //if"

        "output": "The topic of a YouTube post has been described and based on the information, you need to write a hook for starting the post. A catchy hook will keep your readers interested so they keep reading. It would be great if you could come up with as many hooks as you can.\n\nA video showing how to make a tasty cup of coffee was uploaded to YouTube. The topic of the post is that you can boil water faster by using a coffee mug as a heating plate. Explain why boiling water faster is important and give the steps that you used to boil the water so fast.\n\nYou are an expert in cooking, so you can give some suggestions on how to boil the water faster.\n\nYou can also share your experience as a video reviewer who's going to upload a review video that will be shown to potential audiences.\n\nLet me give you a real example of a video to let you follow up your thoughts.\n\nYouTube shows a video on the screen with a coffee mug. The mug is a little bigger than the size of a normal mug. While a normal size coffee mug is 8-10 cups of water or about 400 mL, this coffee mug can hold seven to eight cups of water, or 380 mL. When the video plays out, it shows you that you can put water in the mug, then place it above a heating plate and microwave the water for about 18 seconds and the water heats up. In the video, it shows several other kinds of mugs that are smaller than a normal coffee mug and larger than a normal coffee mug. Some mugs are made of plastic, some are made of glass, iron, steel, and porcelain, and all of them have similar function although it seems that some don't work right because they leak when the water boils up. The video goes on to show four or five mugs and then it concludes that the coffee mug that can hold about seven to eight cups of water heated up about 100 degrees Celsius in 18 seconds is the best to use.\n\nThe hook for the video is: Can you boil the water faster?\n\nThe first thing is to describe what boiling water is or how do we boil water. The video has already done the main job. So you can just mention that boiling water is one of the main ingredients for many dishes like soup, pasta, and rice. These dishes all need boiling water. Next is the hook: How to boil the water faster? In the beginning, the video showed that you can place the mug on the heating plate and use the microwave to let it heat up. However, since using the microwave will heat up the entire mug, the temperature inside the mug is not uniform and the water inside the mug won't heat up evenly. So they said that since these mugs are already shaped like a coffee mug and most people have already used them to serve coffee and they have experience to handle it. So the reason that they think that people don't boil the water faster is probably because you don't know how to manipulate it. So they tested this idea and they got the same results.\n\nThen, go back to the main topic. What is boiling water? Boiling is the process by which a liquid and its dissolved particles are converted into a vapor at a high temperature. The temperature at which the liquid boils is called the boiling point. The temperature at which the liquid boils is not the same for all substances. But the temperatures of the critical point and triple point are the same for all known substances, so you should explain the difference between the boiling point of your subject and the critical point and the triple point. The video did it while showing photos so you can follow up the video.\n\nThen talk about a simple way to make the water boil faster, and finish the hook by asking a question: can you boil the water faster?\n\nIt is recommended that you put the hook at the beginning to catch the attention of your viewers. You can talk about a very interesting part of the video and try to grab the attention of viewers when they're going to watch the video.\n\nHow is the hook different from the question?\n\nQuestion: How do you boil the water faster?\n\nThe question is what the video is going to talk about next and whether the video answers the question.\n\nThe hook is where the video starts. You use the Hook to grab the attention of viewers and make them stay focused on the main idea of the video.\n\nThe answer to the question should be the answer to the hook. For example, the video said you can boil the water faster by using a coffee mug, it is better to use copper to make the water boil faster, and the best way to cook soup is to boil it faster.\n\nWhen you write a full article, it is recommended that you do not only write about the video, but also look for articles with similar videos."

        "output": "Using the provided topic as a starting point, brainstorm ideas for videos that can be made about it on YouTube.\n\nIn spite of the fact that procrastination feels bad to you, why do you do it?\n\nFor the first week of February, what if you gave yourself just one day a week to work on a project that you put off?\n\nWhat if you did it until the end of February, even if that project wasn't finished?\n\nWhat do you think you might learn about yourself? About procrastination?\n\nA few years ago, I wrote a blog post on my website. I wanted to say that there was no excuse. There was no such thing as good procrastination. We all want to blame something, something for giving us the excuse to make ourselves feel better. A bad work environment, a long line, a busy work schedule . . . the list goes on.\n\nSince that morning I became even more intrigued by how much time we put off doing the thing we have to do each day.\n\nBut what can we do about it? I set out to find an effective way to get rid of procrastination. It's been a few years but I still haven't given up on that quest. When I write these words, I've been on a mini-procrastination strike but I have found a ton of other little ways to overcome those little things that we put off.\n\n## Be More Organized Instead of Doing More Work\n\nFor example, you might think, _I should get to the gym today. I have a killer bikini coming up in a few weeks._ But you have something to do today that feels less important: you should go to the grocery store. It comes down to this simple question:\n\n  1. Do I spend the day working and doing more work?\n  2. Do I spend the day being more organized (and, thereby, doing more work)?\n\nHere is an easy way to tell the difference between a procrastinator and someone who gets things done:\n\n  1. Tell someone that procrastinator:\n  * \"You get your job done quickly.\"\n  * \"You manage your time very well.\"\n  * \"You get what you need to do done quickly and you move on to something else.\"\n  * \"You are very organized.\"\n  * \"You are reliable.\"\n  * \"We can always depend on you to get things done quickly and on time.\"\n\nThose are all good ways of speaking about a person who does not procrastinate.\n\n  1. Tell someone who is an overachiever:\n  * \"You put a lot of pressure on yourself.\"\n  * \"You are very competitive.\"\n  * \"You work too many hours in the night just to finish up one project that was a low priority.\"\n  * \"You push yourself to be excellent at everything you do.\"\n\nThose are all good ways of speaking about someone who is an overachiever.\n\nBut they are also ways of speaking about a person who works too hard and uses up extra time and energy doing things rather than focusing on what she is actually working on.\n\n  2. Tell someone who is a procrastinator:\n  * \"You are not reliable.\"\n  * \"Our projects suffer because you are not consistent\"\n  * \"You come to work late, you work for a short period, then you leave early.\"\n  * \"You only do half the work by the time it is due.\"\n\nThose are all good ways of speaking about someone who is a procrastinator.\n\n  2. Tell someone who is an overachiever: \"\n  * \"You always seem to have a lot on your plate?\"\n  * \"You are always putting yourself out there.\"\n  * \"You take over more tasks because you want to do all the work.\"\n  * \"You are so talented, it is almost like you don't even need to work so hard.\"\n\nThose are all good ways of speaking about someone who is so talented, they do too much work.\n\nSee a pattern here?\n\nThey are all good ways of speaking about the kinds of people who put others out, who are so talented they don't need to work so hard, who are so busy they have to keep on top of their work to make sure their workload never gets less than it already is.\n\nThey are all ways of speaking about procrastination and overachievement and productivity.\n\nOverachievers are good at getting things done but not necessarily in the most efficient way.\n\nProcrastinators get things done.\n\nBut they use up all your time and energy before they"

They offer a loyalty program where you can get a free scoop of ice cream after 10 purchases. They also have a 10 percent coupon for their website.\n\nThe Ice Cream Shop is known for the quality of their ice cream. The owners take pride in using fresh ingredients, and the ice cream is made daily and the flavors are rotated frequently so that customers can always find a new flavor they're interested in.\n\nThe current slogan for the shop is \"We don't just make ice cream, we make memories.\"\n\nThis is the opportunity to give the owners a different branding strategy that they could use to promote the business. If the location of the shop is small and quaint, it could help them sell more ice cream with the slogan \"Home of the best ice cream in town!\"\n\nIf they are known for using fresh ingredients, they could use the slogan \"Ice cream as close to homemade as you can get!\"\n\nIf they are known for having a high number of customers, they could use the slogan \"Most customers each day!\"\n\nThe owners could also use something like a slogan that uses a pun. One concept they could use is \"This is not your grandmother's ice cream shop.\"\n\nBrand-A-Grams\n\nBrand-a-grams can be pictures you take of products, especially consumer products. They encourage other consumers to purchase the product.\n\nThey can be used with any service. You can take a photo of your bathroom and then have it printed in different sizes. You can then put it on your wall so that you get compliments from people and they are encouraged to purchase your services.\n\nThe challenge is to create a photo that is not too detailed and not too plain. If it is too detailed, it may not be appealing. If it is too plain, then people may not want to hang it on their wall, and they will not purchase the business.\n\nSo what is the solution? You can ask potential customers for ideas. If a customer is in your shop and says, \"I think you could improve the signage,\" you could ask that them to provide a drawing of what they would like to see.\n\nA person looking to improve his bathroom was very specific when asked and said he would like to have a drawing of a person doing the laundry. This customer had great ideas.\n\nIf you ask customers to provide brand-a-grams, you can have them send you an email with the image or a scanned picture as a high-quality jpeg with a size of 5500 or 600 pixels.\n\nThe challenge for this customer that needed a brand-a-gram in this case was an interesting one. If he had gone with the old-fashioned design and used an artist, it would have taken a lot longer. The brand-a-gram created took only 15 minutes.\n\nBecause he only needed a one-time graphic, he decided to move forward with the brand-a-gram instead.\n\nIn the coming chapters, I will provide strategies for using Brand-a-grams to create awareness, increase sales, and make more profit.\n\n# [12  \nUsing The Power of Words](9780984362135_epub_toc_r1.htm#c12)\n\nWe are 60 percent visual and 40 percent aural. We use both sides of our brain when we talk and think. When we talk, we are utilizing words with specific connotations. In other words, when we speak, we use words. The words that are used are often the key to having an effective strategy to market a business or service.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nWhat one word might mean something completely different to another customer. If you are going to market a new product to the American public, you need to speak to them in their language. This means you need to understand the words they are using.\n\nWhen you understand the key words in a language and you know how they affect the way your reader feels, you can build an emotional connection with customers.\n\nThe way people talk is different in different areas. In the South, they usually use contractions, and in the Midwest and East, they usually do not want to. Words also have a different meaning in different cultures. In the United States, the word 'fun' means something completely different when someone says it to you versus if"

The confirmation does not have to be extensive, but a brief explanation of the type of meeting (if it's a meeting of the board, then a different type of letter may be appropriate) should be given.\n\nThere are many more possible ways to confirm an event. Each is appropriate for the situation.\n\nThe next phase is the meeting.\n\n### Confirm a Board Meeting\n\nAfter the organization plans a meeting, it is necessary to confirm that everyone will show up. Although an email is adequate for most types of meetings, for a meeting of the board, a letter might be more appropriate. This letter is also effective for any other group that has been chosen to plan the meeting.\n\n  * **Board of Directors' Meeting**\n\n**Dear John:**\n\n  * We have a meeting of the board today at 2:00 in the boardroom at the offices, and if you can't join us, then call John and tell him to take over as acting manager.

If it's a board meeting, then the organization's letterhead will be used. Also, depending on the type of the meeting, a formal letter might be appropriate.\n\nThe same email and letter template is used for meetings with other groups.\n\n### Confirm Your Conference\n\nIt is easier to send out an email to confirm that everyone will show up for a meeting rather than write a letter to confirm a conference or workshop. Still, there are several pieces of information that you should include.\n\n  * **Conference or Workshop**\n\n**Dear John:**\n\n  * We have a conference at 7:00 pm next Friday at the company offices, and can we do your homework and report on the conference Thursday? I'll talk to you then. Thanks,\n  * Sam\n  * **Subject Line:** A conference or workshop\n  * **Confirmation**\n\n  * As you know, we will be having a conference next Friday at 7 pm, and I'm sending out an email.\n  * I'll give you your homework then, and we have to start working on the budget for the event starting immediately.\n  * Let me know when is convenient at some point next week to talk.\n  * **Confirmation**\n\n### Confirm Your Seminar\n\nOnce again, the email template is used. The best format is to send it 2 to 3 weeks before the date of the seminar.\n\n  * **Seminars**\n\n**Dear John:**\n\n  * I scheduled a seminar for Saturday, November 9, and if you can attend, please RSVP. If not, then cancel and I'll take over and start work on the other seminar.\n  * Thanks,\n  * Sam\n  * **Subject Line** **:** Seminar: November 9\n  * **Confirmation**\n\n  * As you know, I am planning a seminar on the 9th and need to know if you will be attending and if not, can we use a different date?\n  * **Confirmation**\n\n### Confirm an Announcement\n\nThe announcement template is similar to the letter confirming the board meeting. The announcement is also similar to other types of letters for announcements.\n\n  * **Announcement**\n\n**Dear John and Jane:**\n\n  * We did have a conference on 15 September at 2:00 pm, but if you cannot attend, please call me or John. We need your attendance at the conference to get some important information.\n  * Thanks,\n  * Sam\n  * **Subject Line** **:** Seminar: November 9\n  * **Confirmation**\n\n  * As you may remember, we had the first of three board meetings last year on 15 September.\n  * This year's meeting is 12 Sep, and you were invited in March and"

So you should just send an email to the HR. But don't say that you are looking for better compensation in your email. Instead, please say, \"Dear HR, in a letter about a month ago (the date you received this), I shared some interesting information about myself that may be helpful to your company…\" Once you do that, the HR can start negotiating with you. Your new salary will certainly be higher than the last one that you got at your new job.\nYou need to write an email telling them you deserve a payrise. You need to explain what you bring to the company and the market price of your work.\nA better way to write an email: Dear HR in a company who wrote me a job offer a week ago, let me give you a market review of my work. Here's how much someone like me in my job field would be paid.\nHere's the best example that can explain what you should do.\nDear HR, I am writing to you again to provide information concerning your salary offer. I am aware you have already considered the market data for my market value. In fact, your compensation offer of $60k plus is slightly below the market. In this email, I would love to provide you with an updated salary offer based on my latest market survey.\nPlease let me know if you would want to discuss about my compensation at your convenience. As soon as I hear back from you, I can then review your reply and decide whether I'd be interested in having an interview at your company. My final decision whether I would accept your company's job offer will be based on 3 main factors: salary, company's culture and your communication. I'd love to hear about company's culture in more detail in person during an interview.\nPlease feel free to reach out to me to discuss this opportunity any time to schedule a phone call or an interview. Let's connect on LinkedIn! Thanks for reading this.\nHow can a new graduate negotiate a pay raise? I recently got an offer of $120k from a startup tech. I was able to negotiate this amount up to $130k based on the 30% discount (i.e. $1,200 x .70 = $840). I think I did pretty good considering this is first job, but I still want to know how I can negotiate it higher.\nI would negotiate my salary with the company again. But this time, I would ask them about their salary policy. For example, I'd like to ask them if they offer employees an annual bonus. If yes, can you give me an example for a $130k salary? You have a higher salary than $130k, so I think that you should be able to negotiate it. Also, you should ask them whether they offer 401k savings plan or not. Also, ask if they offer employees health care or not. You never know, maybe they will offer you some additional things if you negotiate again with them.\nIf you get rejected from job offer, never lose hope. Just try this again.\nIf for some reason you get turned down then I advise you to not try for 6 months to a year, only because you will be perceived as someone who just can't get it. It is almost impossible to go back to an employer and say \"Oh, you know, I was offered $X but then I was fired, and now I would be so happy to work for you...\".\nMost importantly, don't accept anything for less than $1300. You don't have enough experience to afford to live on less. So don't let it happen.\nAlso, get all the details regarding stock for your future and whatever you want from them, etc. It is not about money right now, it is all about getting in the door and then you have it.\nThe best way to negotiate a salary at startup is to find out what is the market price of your work.\nJust go to a website such as glassdoor.com or ziprecruiter.com and search for your position. Read some comments from recruiters or people who got a job with the company. You can also ask your friends if they know anyone who is there. The last thing you need is to get hired without knowing what you'll earn. There's nothing worse than getting your hopes up for a year only to find out you are getting paid pennies.\nI was recently recruited. I was offered an employee salary of $40K, and the company offered a bonus of $20K. I was told that I was given this because I'm a recent"

But, he only shows them that month's calendar in the event that no employees change their schedules that month. That's why this meeting is so important.\nIn the case of Microsoft 365, we create an event with an expiration date for everyone in our organization to see. Then, we create another event with the same title as the first one. And, for that event, we can set the expiration date as Today (a single day). For most organizations that doesn't change much. Then, everyone would still see the event until the next time someone changes their shifts within that month.\nMicrosoft 365 Calendar: Is it useful?\nMicrosoft 365 Calendar allows you to have up to 10 different calendars for a single user. One of those calendars, can be the default calendar while the others can be personal. The default calendar"

        "output": "It would be helpful if you could suggest an acronym for the repository.\n\nA python framework for creating, editing, and invoking Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits.\n\n\n## Goals\n\nNISCQ aims to act as a reference implementation for algorithms and simulators for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. This means, most functionality can be used in any language. We aim to make the APIs easy to use and well-documented.\n\nCurrently, these are in active development:\n\n+ General circuit creation, compilation and execution (including noise models, and optimization of circuits)\n+ Simulated noise implementation\n+ Algorithms built from primitive gates:\n  + NISQ-only operations (e.g., single qubits):\n    + State preparation / unitary simulation\n    + Clifford gates\n  + NISQ-only operations (e.g., multi-qubits):\n    + CNOT\n    + Measurement\n  + General quantum gates:\n    + Pauli-Z\n+ Benchmarks and metrics for circuits and noise models:\n  + Benchmark circuits:\n    + Controlled-Pauli-Z\n    + 1D depth-optimised 16 Qubit Clifford circuits\n    + 1D depth-optimised 16 Qubit Pauli-Z circuits\n  + Noise models:\n    + Depolarizing\n    + Depolarizing with error per round\n    + Erasure\n    + Depolarizing and Erasure\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis project is structured around the following concepts, for more information on how to use each:\n\n\n### Python library\n\nThis is the primary way to access NISCQ functionality. This library currently uses python 3.8, but should support python 3.6 and 3.7.\n\nTo install NISCQ using pip, pip install -U niscq\n\nTo install from the latest master branch, using NIST 14.1, run:\n  ```\n  pip install git+URL\n  ```\n\n#### Creating Circuit, Noise Model, and Noise Schedules\n\nTo create a circuit, there are some methods for creating it. \n\n##### Direct\n\n```\ncirc = Circuit(noise_model, num_qubits, ...)\n```\n\nThis will create an instance of a Circuit class. The instance must have a single argument for the noise model, which can be the\nname of a file (see below for more on the various models). The instance can then be configured using the Circuit.num_qubits and set_noise_schedule_depth() functionality, which will create\nan actual circuit representation.\n\nSome circuit examples:\n\n```\n>>> Circuit('depolarizing', 8).num_qubits\n8\n>>> Circuit('depolarizing', 3).num_qubits\n3\n\n\n>> Circuit('erasure', 3).num_qubits\n3\n\n\n>>> Circuit('depolarizing_onetime', 3).num_qubits\n3\n\n>>> Circuit('noise', 6).num_qubits\n6\n\n\n>>> Circuit('noise', 3).num_qubits\n2\n\n\n>>> Circuit('pauli_z').num_qubits\n2\n\n```\n\n\n##### From filename\n\nTo load a pre-existing or customised noise model for a circuit, the Circuit subclass provides convenience functions for common types. \n\nThe Circuit class provides a get_circuit() method to return an instance of Circuit that has been already created using a filename.\n\nTo create a Circuit instance from a filename of input model:\n\n```\nfilename = 'pauli_z.json'\ncirc = Circuit(filename)\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nfilename = 'depolarizing_onetime.json'\ncirc = Circuit(filename)\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nfilename = 'niscq_example_circuit.json'\ncirc = Circuit(filename)\n```\n\nor\n\n```\ncircuit = Circuit(filename)\ncirc.configure(noise_model_name)\n...\n# circuit.get_circuit() will return a fully-defined circuit\n```\n\n##### Onetime-only models\n\nA convenience method for Circuit also includes a set of pre-canned functions for common noise models for 1-time only operations. \n\n```\n>>> Circuit.Depolarizing.configure()\n>>> Circuit.Depolarizing._get_operator().summary()\n\n\n\n  Cl"

Mention what makes it inappropriate if you think they can't.\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\nThe Dark Knight is a superhero film about the Dark Knight fighting the villain of the same name. The villain is of course, an antagonistic, evil character who kills a large part of a significant force in the world. It also has some very graphic violence and strong language, with some nudity and other aspects of the film which makes this hard for children to watch without guidance. It also doesn't make it easy for people to be able to watch together, because of the strong language and violence. \n\nOne would think a superhero film like this would be considered suitable for most young children, however it is actually a very mature film, the movie talks about the consequences of violence on society, and on the family structure, it has strong violence, strong language and nudity.\n\nAs for the violence, the film features Batman's alter egos fighting a massive bad guy, and it also shows torture, and it has a large amount of blood splashed all over the screen, there are some very violent scenes which make this a no-go for children. For example there is a very graphic scene with a beating which makes some people feel sick. Language is another consideration, there is a lot of swearing from all characters, some very graphic swearing. There are even some jokes based on violence and this language, this can be very upsetting for little ones. For example one of the characters says he can't even eat popcorn, it will be a 'goner'. Nudity is also another drawback of the movie, it shows Batman's alter egos in a very revealing costume: black boots, blue pants, and a leather corset, very very revealing. There is lots of body contact, the scene that shows this is where Batman is having sex with Robin. The movie also shows a character hanging a woman he kidnapped over a fire, and he is laughing while hes doing it.\nI think that in order to make this film appropriate, the director should show less violence, even though this is a superhero film, he should show less blood and keep the swearing to a minimum. Maybe he could have another scene in the police station with Batman telling the police how they can use his abilities to stop crime before the climax of the film. Or he could show the character \"getting his act together\", by showing his \"journey\" before the climax of the film."

It is possible (and important) to do the bulk of your prepwork before you leave home, but even if you still have things on your must-bring list, remember that your bag can be a portable storefront so you don't have to lug all those items home afterward.\n\n### Choosing the Perfect Bag\n\nThere are so many kinds of bags in today's world that you can find something for your needs, style, and budget. From lightweight spinner luggage to classic-looking leather duffel bags, there are all kinds. In this section, we'll help you narrow down your choices to the bag that will work best for your trip. Then, you'll learn some of the ways you can use your bag during travel both on and off the plane.\n\n#### _Getting the Bag for the Layover_\n\nBefore you go, try taking your passport and the other necessities you think you'll need for your trip with you on an unplanned trip to the airport. A trip to the mall is a good place to try out your luggage. Do you need to be able to zip it up and down? What about folding it? Can you get your hands on it without any trouble? At all times, your main goal when you travel is to stay as safe, comfortable, and secure as possible.\n\n#### _How Big Should Your Bag Be?_\n\nWhen it comes to how big your carry-on and checked baggage should be, the size you choose is largely determined by where you are headed. If you are going to Asia, you will want to bring a large bag. If you're traveling to a place like South Africa, you should bring what is probably the smallest bag you can find. You can use the table below to make this decision. Check the \"Traveling to\" column for the country, and the \"Bag Size\" column for the ideal length of your bag.\n\nTraveling to| Bag Size  \n---|---  \nMost of Eurasian continent| Medium or large  \nNorth America| Anything but large  \nEastern Europe and parts of Asia and the Mediterranean| Small bag  \nAfrica and South America| Small bag  \nThe Caribbean| Small bag\n\nThere are some other factors to keep in mind while you are putting your luggage together. For example, is it important to you to have quick access to your laptop in a crowded airport, or do you plan to have it with you almost the whole time? Do you prefer to fly carry-on whenever possible, or do you have bigger pieces of luggage that need to be checked?\n\n#### _The Right Size for You_\n\nYou will be doing a lot of things while you are traveling, and your luggage will be your most important companion for these endeavors. So choose the right size for you. Is it important to you to be able to fit your day bag plus a carry-on in the overhead bin?\n\n### Packing for Your Trip\n\n### Your Packing Essentials\n\nNo matter which part of the globe you're heading to, you can't leave home without these items:\n\n1 passport\n\n2 or more credit or debit cards\n\n3 or more photos in passports\n\n4 or more forms of identification (such as a driver's license, airline ticket, student ID, medical records, and birth certificate)\n\n5 or more business cards from fellow travelers or business contacts"

The pool is gorgeous and the view amazing.\nWe recently stayed at the Aloft hotel whilst visiting Sydney during the New Year's revelry. I would like to give my opinion on the value of this establishment at this time. Firstly, we booked it in advance and made sure we had a view for the firework display. However, after getting here, I was told that there was a \"New Year's Party\" right on the same side of the hotel we had booked our room, which completely ruined our view of the fireworks for the entire weekend. When we booked the room, we were assured that there would be plenty of time to enjoy the view all night. Our room was also very nice, quiet as expected. The only problem our room had was that the aircon was rather loud and hard to turn down at night. This made for a very cold room for the weekend. A few other issues: at the front desk they were extremely rude and unhelpful with checking in. There is no complimentary water in the room at all. You have to get your own from a vending machine. My room was very cold but they did nothing about that. When we got here and I was complaining about the lack of view because of the New Year's party, our first impression was when they asked if we found the room hot or cold. They certainly were not very friendly at all. If you're looking for a comfortable room with an unbelievable view to see the New Year's countdown, I would definitely not recommend this hotel.\nA friend of mine is planning a Sydney Holiday and the Aloft Hotel is part of the plans. I checked up on the hotel in Sydney, Australia and came across some of the recent reviews. The hotel offers accommodation in Sydney and the area is part of a new hotel district that is located in the Darling Harbour area. The Aloft hotel is part of an international hotel group named Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. that offers high standards of luxury hotel rooms across the world.\nThe hotel in Sydney features accommodation rooms with high levels of design and state-of-the-art amenities. The Aloft hotel has a good location and it is only a short stroll away from the Sydney Aquarium, the Sky Tower and the Powerhouse Museum. The Darling Harbour area has restaurants, bars and shops with the Star City Casino also located in the same area.\nThe Aloft hotel in Sydney may be expensive but there are many advantages of staying at this luxury hotel. Some of the things which I like about staying at the Aloft hotel include the room designs, the cleanliness of the rooms, the great service and the facilities offered, and other features of the hotel. This hotel is rated as having excellent facilities for a hotel of such quality and is popular amongst people visiting Sydney.\n\"The rooms and service were okay\"\nWe are in Adelaide. We stayed at Aloft for one night while on business in Adelaide.\nAs this hotel was a very short stay, only a night, I wasn't expecting much except a good time, and so I was pleasantly surprised by our stay at the hotel. First, as I had checked in the previous night to work in the city, we arrived early evening after 6pm. We walked in and the room was ready and waiting for us. This was a relief as we had heard that the rooms were subject to some delays, and so all the better that we were already in our rooms. Our room was very clean and tidy. The air conditioning system was not overly cold, probably because I was so hot after the walk back from the hotel,"

However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.\nIs == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?\n\nA: The < and == operators compare the reference value. The .equals() method and equals() in the Object class (which it inherits from) both compare the contents of an object.\nNote that in general, compare to and compare equal should not be used as synonyms. The former includes comparisons with == and != whereas the latter is reserved for comparing the contents of objects for equality.\n\nA: == compares reference equality, in other words, whether both pointers refer to the same object. .equals() can be a little confusing though, because in order to ensure object equality it first needs to compare the pointers it gets on the argument lists to ensure these are pointing to the same object. If it doesn't, the function will raise a NPE.\nExample:\nString b = a.replace(\"g\", \"h\");\nString c = \"This is an example string\";\n\nif (a.equals(\"This is an example string\")){\n    // This will cause a RuntimeException to occur\n}\nif (a.equals(c)){\n    // This will not do anything\n}\n\nNow, because of how the .equals() works, if you did what was intended in the first example it would compare strings to make sure they refer to objects in the same memory location. This causes problems when you are comparing strings to see which refers to a valid string. \nIn the second example, you can do the same thing because the strings are compared to see if they refer to the same string object (they're both in the same memory location). \nIn practice, you'll see .equals() used a lot, especially since it can be more efficient.\n\nA: If the strings point to the same object\n ==\n\nwill return the true value, whereas\n .equals()\n\nwill return false if the string is empty or null."

Most resources. But you already know them.\nJust a few examples from official documentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*multiprocessing.manager.ManagedArray.set, 2.0.6\n\n*multiprocessing.Pool.close, 2.0.6\n\n*multiprocessing.Queue.put, 2.0.6\n\n*multiprocessing.Queue.get, 2.0.6\n\n*threading.Condition.acquire, 1.2.2\n\n*threading.Thread.__init__\n\n*threading.Lock.acquire, 1.8.1\n\n*threading._bounded_cond, 1.8.1\n\n*threading._local, 1.8.1\n\n*threading._Local.__init__, 1.8.1\n\n*threading._local._LockHandle.__init__, 1.8.1\n\n*threading._local._LockHandle.release, 1.8.1\n\n\n\nAlso, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.\n\nIt is not clear to me, what are you doing. Your code snippet is not clear. But you want do something:\ntry:\n    if not jobqueue.qsize():\n        return\n    p = process(jobqueue.get())\n    p.start()\nexcept:\n    #do something, probably exception handling etc\n\nor something like\nprocess(jobqueue.get())\n\nIn first case it is obvious, that you are using Thread, in second - Process. You do not need multiprocessing to do this. You can use Thread. Start it's parent with 'join' function\n\nA: *\n\n*In threading you have only one thread which takes a function.  Once it runs, it's thread terminates. Threading is single threaded, so you can't do parallel processing.\n\n*In a Process object, you can spawn off sub-processes at certain points. So you can run your code in multiple processes (if you have cpu cores, that is)\n\n*Thread locks are used when you want to stop a thread from running so that it waits until that lock's condition is true.  With a process, you only need a lock when you want to access/manipulate shared objects.\n\n\nThe examples in the documentation should be pretty clear.\n\nA: There is no difference between \"threading\" and \"multiprocessing\" in python; I'm aware that this is a controversial sentence so bear with me.\nWhat are the differences between them?\nWell, a thread is like a very short script that the interpreter has to jump around, in order to do the same things that a normal script would do (although there are some things it can"

        "output": "Design a programming problem related to the subject that has been given to you. Use some examples and constraints to improve your question.\n\nDynamic Programming\n\nIn the last section, I mentioned recursion when talking about backtracking and how to model it with a recursive function. I also talked about how in recursion we have to carefully use the stack to make sure that when we return from a function we don't try to run the function again. The good news is that there is a way to deal with recursion, and all our recursion functions now have a parent function that knows how to call itself. Let's take a look at a few examples of recursive functions and how to use a stack to solve them, and then we'll talk about how we make backtracking problem-solving easier when we can now use dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is where we try to find a solution to a problem and stop solving it at a certain point, we \"save\" the solution so far, and use it to help solve the problem at the next level of scale.\n\nFirst there was recursion. Then there was backtracking, which uses a stack to create a solution. With recursion you have the backtracking function that creates the entire solution, while with backtracking you have an iterator (the backtracking function) that helps find a solution to a specific region or piece of a problem. Now we have what I'm referring to as dynamic programming. With dynamic programming, instead of recursion, you have the recursive function that knows when to stop and to use the solution so far (in the stack) to solve the current problem.\n\nLet's take a look at a few examples of recursion first. Each of these problems is about finding the length of a branch from a tree. To find the length of a branch, you either have to find the total length of a branch, or go down to a branch and find the total length of the branch starting at that node. Here's the code for the length of a branch:\n\nstatic int\n\nlengthOfBranch(Node root)\n\n{\n\nif (root != null)\n\n{\n\nreturn 1 + lengthOfBranch(root.getLeft().getLeft().getLeft());\n\n}\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\nNotice that this function assumes that all nodes have children! Let's take a look at this function from a different angle. The code is pretty self-explanatory, it's just a base case and a recursive case. The recursive case is \"what would happen if I was at the rightmost node of the tree. In the recursive case, then I just need to find all the values and add their lengths together. Because I'm only looking at the top one level, I need to add the lengths of the leftmost, rightmost, and the last node, if any, on its right side. This is where being able to take advantage of the stack can help. Notice how at the end of the base case, I'm always setting result to 0.\n\nNote\n\nYou can actually remove the 0 and let the program detect when it is not defined. But it's good if you're practicing to make sure it's well-defined in case you are testing a function that assumes you defined everything even though not all the nodes are always defined as the recursive case continues.\n\nLet's see how this might work in practice.\n\nstatic int\n\nlengthOfBranch(Node root, int []lengthList)\n\n{\n\nlengthList[root.data.toString()] =\n\nlengthList[root.data.toString()] + 1;\n\nif (root == null)\n\n{\n\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\nint length =\n\n1 + lengthOfBranch(root.getLeft(),lengthList)\n\n+ lengthOfBranch(root.getRight(),lengthList);\n\nif (lengthList[root.data.toString()]\n\n!= 0)\n\n{\n\nlengthList[root.data.toString()] =\n\nlengthList[root.data.toString()]\n\n+ Math.pow(2,lengthList[root.data.toString()])\n\n+ 1;\n\n}\n\nreturn length;\n\n}\n\nHere's a run-through of the function:\n\n  * First, as with other functions, we pass along a reference to a value. In this case, the length array, and we want to make sure it's not null.\n\n  * Then we set the array to start at the node that it's in, and make sure it'"

        "output": "Think of topics that are most common in classic interview questions for a job in computer science. For example, “How would you best describe yourself?” or “How to you handle being stressed?” or “What kind of atmosphere do you need in your work environment?” What types of things do you try to avoid thinking about?\nHow do you want to be judged?\nThere are times when you will be judged on your appearance. This might include a job interview or a sports competition. The way that people see you can affect whether you get the job or whether you win the competition.\nIn the past, many people thought that attractive people were likely to be judged more positively than others. There was also a belief that people who had less power (in the case of job interviews) were unlikely to be judged negatively about their appearance. These ideas were challenged and some were even dismissed. Today we can see that it is hard to tell how someone is judged about their appearance. Therefore, how you judge someone’s appearance can depend on how attractive you see someone. You are likely to be less critical of other people if you find them attractive.\nIn your next job interview or social situation, think about how your appearance is likely to be judged. What do you expect people to be thinking about your appearance?\nCan you think of a time in which a person was judged about their appearance? Were the expectations influenced by appearance or was this about other things?\nDo you think that your ability to dress well will help you to be judged more positively? How is your behaviour likely to be judged?\nWays to use and evaluate the self-talk that is on offer.\nHow do you think they feel about your questions? Are these things that they would never think about doing? Are they likely to be comfortable with answering such questions honestly?\nDo they get annoyed with you? Why do you think this? Does it matter?\nDo you think that you are being honest? Do you think that you are making a difference by asking these questions?\nThis activity is about the question of self-awareness. Sometimes we don’t really know what we are thinking or feeling. When we do something that we don’t really want to do, it might be because we don’t understand what is behind our behaviour. It might be better if we were able to know how we feel and what is influencing our behaviour even when we’re not really aware of it. To do well, we need to be able to listen to and understand our own thoughts and feelings. It’s good to ask for help from others so that we can learn more about what is going on for us.\nHave you ever asked someone for help to make sense of something? If you have, what was it that you wanted from the other person?\nHave you ever tried to work out what you wanted without asking other people? How well did this work out? Did you think their help was useful?\nWhat questions work best when you are asking other people for help? How good are you at asking questions to get your answers?\nWhat is it that you need to find out from the other person? How difficult it this to ask these questions? Do you think it is fair on that person?\nDid you get the answers that you wanted? Which answers were useful and important to you? Which were not? Why do you think that?\nHow honest are you with your friends?\nDo you let them know what you are really thinking?\nDo you try to cover up things that you are not happy with?\nIf someone asked you for your help, would you help them?\nWould you encourage someone else to help themselves?\nDo you know where everyone is in the room at any given time?\nIt is really easy to become overwhelmed by our own thoughts. The way we think about ourselves and what is important to us can vary enormously. Our thoughts about ourselves can change over a period of time. In the next activity, you will find it useful to think about what you are currently thinking about yourself.\nHow is your body? Do you take care of yourself in the way that you deserve?\nHow are your friends? Are you having problems with your friends?\nWhat do you think are the causes of the problems in your relationship? Is there one thing that you would like to change?\nHow do you feel about your work? What are your hopes for your work in the future?\nWhat are your likes and dislikes? Where do you find pleasure? Where are you going to have to work hard?\nThese are all thoughts that you currently have in your head. If you can’t think of any thoughts that are important to you, then there is something different going on. Remember that we often think about things that are very important to us and not that others things. It is very common to have thoughts that seem very important to us but not very important to the rest of the world. How you think about these things is a good"

It is involved in many biochemical processes in the body and is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune system. Excess zink is not harmful as it is excreted in the urine. Zinc deficiency is known to cause several health problems including lowered immunity, abnormal growth, hearing problems, cancer, etc.\n\nZinc plays an important role in the metabolism of insulin. Zinc deficiency has been linked to hyperandrogenic syndrome, a condition that involves higher levels of male hormones in women which can cause their breasts to become enlarged and look feminine (see Appendix B on page 243).\n\nZinc also plays a crucial role in hair growth. Zinc deficiency has been associated with hair loss. The deficiency can also lead to low testosterone levels and a feeling of hopelessness and depression.\n\nIn addition, zinc is necessary for reproduction because it stimulates sperm production in men and helps to improve women's fertility.\n\nZinc also plays an important role in the structure of protein and is needed for normal bone development.\n\nZinc deficiency can impair bone development.\n\nZinc deficiency can inhibit proper bone\n\ndevelopment.\n\nAdequate zinc is essential for the treatment of hyperactivity and poor\n\nlearning abilities (1).\n\nIn the development of fetal and newborns (fetusses and infants)\n\n(2), the role of zinc is crucial.\n\nZinc is directly involved in the development of fetuses\n\n(3) and newborns.\n\nZinc deficiency is responsible for malnutrition of newborns (fetuses)\n\n(4), which affects the way the brain develops.\n\nZinc deficiency affects the structure of DNA and RNA and damages the cells.\n\nZinc deficiency inhibits the synthesis of DNA and RNA, which affects the structure and\n\nfunction of all cells and causes cell damage (5).\n\nThe results of extensive studies show that the function of zinc plays an important role in the protection the body against the aging process.\n\nThe role of zinc in the protection of the cells against damage caused by free radicals is\n\nexhaustively documented (see Ref. 6).\n\nThe results of the extensive research show that zinc protects\n\nour cells from damage caused by free radicals\n\n(excess electron activity).\n\nZinc participates in the formation of the immune cells.\n\nZinc reduces the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and\n\nincreases the amount of anti-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nZinc reduces the amount of pro- and anti-inflammatory\n\ncytokines, thus contributing to the production of a balanced immune system.\n\nZinc activates T cells, which is responsible for the body's natural defense\n\nagainst pathogens.\n\nZinc deficiency causes an increase in the number of lymphocytes,\n\nwhich are responsible for the body's natural defense against\n\npathogens.\n\nZinc activates the T cells of the lymph nodes, which is responsible for\n\nthe body's protection against pathogens.\n\nZinc reduces the number of lymphocytes that are responsible\n\nfor the body's natural defense against pathogens.\n\nAdequate supplementation with zinc (8mg daily for women and 11mg for men) can increase the number of T cells by up to 6 times (2).\n\nIf we take into account the fact\n\nthat:\n\nT cells (including natural killer cells) are\n\nresponsible for the body's natural defense against\n\npathogens,\n\nthe supplementation with zinc in the recommended dosage\n\ncan increase the natural defense system of the body against\n\npathogens tenfold.\n\nZinc deficiency, and therefore high levels of inflammation\n\nin the organism, also imposes significant metabolic\n\nburdens on the body, which, in turn, is a significant driver\n\nof all the other health conditions.\n\nThe metabolic burden caused by excessive inflammation\n\n(caused by zinc deficiency) is a major contributor to aging\n\nand degenerative diseases.\n\nPro-inflammatory cytokines, also known as acute phase reactants,\n\ncaused zinc deficiency, increase inflammation and the risk of chronic\n\ndiseases.\n\nInflammation, oxidative stress, and overproduction of\n\nglucocorticoids increase the risk of\n\ndisease\n\nZinc deficiency, as well as the pro-inflammatory state,\n\nincrease the risk of diseases;\n\nInflammation also causes oxidation (damage to the cell membranes),\n\nwhich increases the risk of further damage to our organs,\n\nand therefore disease"

In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting. The French sculptor Émile-Antoine Bourdelle and the Dutch printmaker Kees Verwey expressed themselves through mathematics.\n\nMany artists with a mathematical training have worked in an academic setting where they studied art history or worked on applied arts such as posters and graphics. Although they often have worked on purely abstract compositions, some also have made work with a mathematical basis. This has taken the form of art objects, such as the mathematical constructions associated with the Dada artist Man Ray, and the geometrical designs of Theo van Doesburg. In modern sculpture and installation art, three-dimensional and spatial forms often have been explored, e.g., by Marcelo Cícero; others, such as Carl Andre, Robert Morris, Richard Serra, Robert Smithson, and Bruce Nauman, have explored geometry in spatial art. Other artists who have worked with geometry are Jean (Hans) Arp, John Grillo, Henri Michaux and Yves Tanguy, while other, including the late 19th-century sculptor Alexander Calder and the German-American artist Georg Trakl, have worked with non-Euclidean geometry. The geometric work of Robert Hudson is one of his best-known. The work of the minimalist sculptor Richard Long explores the geometry and mathematics of the natural world. Many performance artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Yvonne Rainer explored mathematics and the form of the stage. Yoko Ono has worked with mathematics for a long time; and the mathematicians John Conway and John Horton Conway, John H. Conway and James Tanton in painting. In music, mathematical aesthetics has had a long history. In the 20th and 21st centuries, several composers have explored geometrical forms in music.\n\nSince 2007, the Science Museum in London has run a large exhibition of historical and modern works of art and art objects connected to mathematics and geometry.

        "output": "Improve the article using your knowledge of the topic in order to make it more informative.\n\nThe \"fair trade\" movement, also known as the \"trade justice\" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.\n\nIn 1966 the United Nations's General Assembly Resolution 2200a was passed, requiring that the exporting nation \"take due account of the interests and concerns of the exporting countries and make efforts to encourage and promote cooperation between exporting and importing states in connection with the fair and equitable treatment in international trade\". These efforts culminated in the creation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1961, which has its own guidelines on what constitutes \"fair and equitable trading.\"\n\nThere is also increasing awareness of the need for fair labour practices in other fields, such as the production of automobiles, computer equipment, pharmaceuticals, and the apparel industry. In the United States, the 1992 passage of the \"Clayton Antitrust Act\" forced companies to publicly announce their efforts to improve production practices. It was also during the 1990s that the United States government began to pass legislation enforcing the use of corporate \"social responsibility\" as a means of maintaining competitive advantage in global markets.\n\nThese policies have encouraged firms to take an active role in improving the economic conditions of both domestic and foreign suppliers, which have themselves begun to provide greater access to health care, education, and other benefits to those people directly or indirectly involved in their production. This has resulted in a greater awareness, among consumers and other parties, of a firm's actions regarding environmental and social criteria and in an expectation among stakeholders that they will play a more direct role in the creation of rules governing such measures.\n\nIn practice \nThe OECD's \"OECD Guidelines For The Regulation Of The Economic Development Of Certain Areas of Mexico\" (the OECD/Mexico Guidelines) are an example of voluntary standards that reflect the requirements for fair trade to operate effectively. While they do not specifically establish a process for making fair trade decisions, they do include a requirement for countries to conduct periodic public reviews of fair trade practices in order to determine whether they are effectively enforced through adequate legal, institutional and educational mechanisms.\n\nSimilarly, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has created a \"Working Group on Fair Trade\" that seeks to encourage countries to establish fair-trade measures similar to those outlined above through the use of technical assistance, capacity building, and knowledge exchange between nations. It also provides ongoing support for developing countries as they formulate national policies designed specifically for fair trading.\n\nAn example of fair trade standards being implemented in practice is the \"Fairtrade Foundation\" which was set up in 1991 by a coalition of UK retailers and consumers for the purpose of promoting fair trade practices in the domestic economy. It has since been joined by hundreds of companies and organizations all over Europe who produce and market what is described as “Fairtrade Certified Products.” Examples of these products include:\n\n Coffee, cocoa, sugar, tea, and fruit juices made from “Fairtrade Certified Coffee”.\n Chocolate made from “Fairtrade certified cocoa”.\n Fairtrade cotton and organic cotton.\n “Fairtrade tea”.\n Organic fruits and vegetables, including “Fairtrade berries”\n Organic vegetables and nuts.\n Organic rice—a major export from Thailand to the Philippines.\n Organic sugar—made by small-scale cane farmers in India.\n\nTo facilitate a fair trade deal, a commodity's price also needs to be negotiated before the transaction. Most major trading firms do this using two methods: an \"offer\" where the exporter provides a range of prices with an \"ask\" and also \"bid\" and \"ask\". The former is usually done when the firm has a good market position and the exporter must accept an offer. The latter is more common when a company has a relatively weak position and must request a price.\n\nThe \"Fairtrade International Foundation\" (formerly the \"World Fair Trade Organization\" or \"WFO\") is a non-profit, international trade organization that promotes fair labor conditions and other social criteria in the production of agricultural goods. The Fairtrade Foundation is also working to ensure that consumers, companies and governments are provided with \"fair trade\" options when making purchases.\n\nDevelopment and evolution \nThe first fair-trade initiative was set up in 1971 by a group of British retailers and businesses as the \"Fair Share Group\". This was followed by the \"Fair Trade Organization of Germany\" (in 1975), the \"Fair Trade Campaign of Holland\" (1976), and the \"Fair Trade Campaign of Austria\" (in 19"

The invention of musical amplification and electronic instruments, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized classical and popular music, and accelerated the development of new forms of music.\n20th-century Western classical music includes a diverse range of styles. From about 1900, some composers used new musical ideas to express their personal philosophies, world-views, and feelings. These so-called experimental composers used new musical instruments and technologies and created new sounds. They wrote unconventional forms of musical theatre, and experimental compositions. New techniques and technologies were incorporated into 20th-century forms including popular music, jazz, and electronic and popular dance music.\n\nWhile some 20th-century music remained anchored in conventions of the past, many popular styles originated or coalesced in the 20th century. They included early examples of rock and roll (1930s), and most commonly, jazz, swing, bebop, salsa, country, blues, punk, rock, rhythm and blues, disco, hip hop and rap. Early hip hop and rap, popular in the 1970s and 1980s, became very influential in Western, African, and Latin music cultures. The electric guitar became widely used, and, in classical music, the use of electronic instruments became standard practice.\n\nAfter the Second World War, music moved to new and emerging cities and venues. As the century progressed, it began to become highly commercialised in the West, where record profits and record loss led to consolidation of the music industry. In the U.S., many African-American musicians became a major influence on music, and the Harlem Renaissance, a blossoming of black art and culture, produced many important musicians, including the classic jazz performers and composers Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker. From the 1920s in the US, music genres such as swing, bebop, and rock and roll were developed. It was replaced by a genre known as rhythm and blues, which was further separated into R&B and pop by the beginning of the 1960s. Rock and roll was later transformed into 1960s and 1970s psychedelic rock, jazz fusion, hard rock, heavy metal, funk, and onward throughout the 1980s. After a surge of American popular music in the late 1980s known as the \"Second British Invasion\", a new wave of British acts gained popularity during the 1990s, which had a major effect on the U.S., as did U.S. techno in the early and mid-1990s.\n\nWith the arrival of the Internet, it became easy for independent artists to access markets to which they had no access before. This created new opportunities for artists, creating a significant change from the industrialization of music. The availability of streaming services such as Apple Music, Youtube Music, Spotify, SoundCloud has also enabled new music genres to thrive. Streaming services also allow for the discovery of new music, as well as the access to more genres than ever before. Additionally, it allows for more customization to individual listeners' interests, and more direct engagement with listeners. The advent of streaming services has resulted in the increased revenue of artists, but it has also resulted in less revenue for radio stations and major labels that are less digitalized than independent artists. However, radio has become more creative due to their lack of revenue and has increased the amount of advertising on radio since.\n\nSee also\n Music of the 20th century\n Music of the 21st century\n Timeline of music history\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n \n \n\n 1950s\n 1950s-related lists\n1950s music by genre\n1950s in music\n Music\n20th century-related lists\n1."

        "output": "Come up with the courses that one is supposed to take in order to be an expert in a given field.\n\nGraphic Design\n\nComputer Programming\n\nFilm\n\nBusiness\n\nMarketing\n\nAdvertising\n\nAnd so on...\n\nBut this list is incomplete because it doesn't include the real essence of what it means to be a creative person. Although these specific areas and occupations are important to many people, the person that creates will find a way to contribute whatever is needed at the time it is needed. What makes a true creative creative?\n\n1. Passion\n\nTo develop their craft, creatives have to love what they do. Creativity is only of value if it applies to something we believe in, if it resonates with us, and if it comes from our center of truth.\n\nThis is the same motivation most people will find when we are doing what we love.\n\nSo, what do we love? We can do anything we like, and we can love anything we do. Some people like music, some people like writing, some people like painting.\n\nFor me it takes some work to find what I want to be passionate about. All my life I wanted to be a professional guitar player, so at the beginning of my career I did nothing but practice. But I soon realized that this was the wrong way to go about it. I had to love what I did (and this comes from the place of truth). So, after I had been playing for about 3 years at a local club, I heard other guitarists and found that what I was doing wasn't good enough. I needed to change what I was doing. The most important thing I learned in this situation was that I needed to let go and let God (a phrase you'll hear a lot later on in this book) guide me.\n\n2. Freedom\n\nCreatives do not do what they do to make money or to be the most successful in any way. They are the ones who choose where to spend their energy. This is one of the greatest freedoms we have as artists, since it is a choice that we have never been limited by.\n\nMost of us have jobs that involve paying bills, etc. In order to be able to pay those bills, we must take on other people's opinions and we often have to compromise to the point where we are unhappy with what we are doing.\n\nFor us, it is the complete opposite.\n\nWhat we can do to support our creative endeavors is limit the number of people that are involved. The more people there are getting in the way, the less time and energy we'll have available. And if we have less time and energy available, then it will be much harder to create what we are excited about.\n\nMany creatives find that they are happier and more valuable to the world if they can live on very limited incomes. This does not make sense to a lot of people, however; I think we need to remember that this is not their primary value. What they are trying to do is contribute and that is what is important. It's kind of like the person who wants to become a professional athlete. They play this game as an opportunity to be recognized for having a passion for something and to inspire others. Not to make money, but to be the best at what they do.\n\n3. The World\n\nOur biggest asset is the world. This may seem strange to some people since most of us spend all of our time trying to get rid of certain things, but to the creative, the world is the one thing that gives us purpose and it is the source of infinite possibilities. The more aware we are of the world and its possibilities, the more valuable and powerful we become.\n\nWithout this appreciation and ability to see, we become stuck with our preconceived mindsets and we can't change. If we want to create something with real value, however, we need to get as aware as possible of everything we encounter.\n\nWe need to make sure our perspective is global.\n\nWhen we go walking in the forest, we need to see everything we pass and, when we come back, see everything we have passed through from inside out again while lying in bed at night. This may sound a little strange to some people, but doing this can really help us get connected to the part of us that wants to create. If the trees that we passed by had a part to play in our creation, then we need to have this part of us.\n\n4. Imagination\n\nCreativity is a big part of everything that a human does, so we need to remember that when we come up against any of our limitations. Once we realize that we have to create, we need to remember that we are not limited.\n\nOur creative imagination is a powerful tool but we often get caught with preconceived notions of what's possible.\n\nWe can get"

        "output": "Give students tips on how to keep their nerves under control during class presentations.\nWhat is the best question to ask? You can ask yourself this question before you begin presenting: What is the best possible question you can think of? A great question will drive the lesson forward. It will help you move to the next thing, and your students may be more interested in the answer.\nThe more you read and listen to others, the better your presentation will be. For example, if you are going to talk about the history of medicine in the United States, listen to the newscast.\nStudents, if you have been listening to presentations all your life, you’re probably tired of that! Presentations that are too long are boring because not everyone wants to hear all of the information.\nIf you have two or three big things to talk about, divide those up into separate points and present at the end what you have already talked about.\nWhen you have finished a presentation, check your notes. What are the things on your list that you did not talk about? If your notes include the name of the person you are speaking about, and you forgot to say it, it will cause you to do what? Look up!\nBe careful of this mistake because it is easy to make.\nTo be effective in a presentation, you must be friendly with your audience. If you don’t think you are friendly, practice being friendly with everyone you meet. Remember how people interact with you when you are friendly. They will smile and laugh.\nHave you ever been in a school or public place that was not very warm? Most of us have, and we feel uncomfortable.\nJust as you would turn your room or building into a very warm place, you would do this with your presentation.\nFor example, if you wanted something to make you feel nice, what would you do? If it were me, I’d get a big bag of M&M’s from a candy store and eat them all.\nDo you imagine that you’re as cute as Tweety Bird? You probably are, because you are much cuter. You’ve been watching too much television. What are some things you can do to make you look cute? When you’re alone, laugh at yourself! When you do a laugh-to yourself, it makes your face look different. You probably have a double chin.\nIn business meetings, everyone in the room should be involved in the discussion. If it is a meeting of teachers, everyone must also be involved in the discussion, because those who are not in the room are not responsible for what is going on.\nEven so, you have to have a good attitude about it. No matter what you think you should say, you have to ask if there is anyone else who has anything to say. Then listen to what they have to say. You can’t do all the talking. If there are any other people who want to talk, they have as much right to speak as you do.\nIn a recent study, when students were asked to evaluate their best presentation, they ranked “warm greeting, smile, and open body language” as the most important aspects of their presentation.\nThis tells us two important things. First, you must be friendly. You can make your students more comfortable by smiling at them. Smile, and smile broadly because it makes you appear more sincere. Then, make eye contact because smiling with your eyes helps warm the audience.\nSecond, and most important, you must learn to speak in a friendly manner. If you are not very good at it, be comfortable and happy with yourself. You know that you are not a professional.\nWhen you are ready, you think you are ready. When they don’t notice you or look at you, you can talk about yourself.\nAs a professional, you are not really an expert. You have to know a lot of things, but you are not the expert.\nThis is important because if you know a lot but you don’t know how to express yourself or how to teach, you are not an expert. Experts use their brains to make their presentations work. They don’t just know what they have to say. They have to be able to say it in a friendly manner."

        "instruction": "You can easily make your holidays more eco-friendly by following these simple steps:",
        "output": "You can easily make your holidays more eco-friendly by following these simple steps:\nRecycle Christmas trees. Trees can become a very expensive disposal option if you don’t recycle them. If you live in a place where Christmas trees are burned, consider donating your tree or have it shredded for use as mulch. If you live in a place where they’re not burned, recycling is usually available, and you can sell your tree to a reseller. This is an excellent way to save some money and to help the environment. If you live in an area that is not open to recycling Christmas trees, find out about the different options you can use to dispose of your tree and help the environment.\nCompost. When you compost your holidays this way, you use all the holiday materials you need to create the perfect composting garden. Your trash bag gets turned into nutrients that you can use to nourish other plants. You can leave out the trash bag and set out the compost bucket. This way, you can start right away with your compost.\nCreate your holidays yourself. One of the best ways to save on your energy use is by not buying any holiday gifts. Instead, make your own gifts. Your friends and family will love that you’re making an effort to save money and to help the environment. Just make sure that the gifts are handmade, not homemade. You can also create homemade toys for your children or animals to play with or homemade household items for you to use around the house. In addition, you can make your own ornaments or use recycled materials (such as newspaper or metal ornaments) to create your own gift decorations.\nEat homemade. When you create your holiday meals yourself, you can make sure that you’re using organic and sustainable foods. Cooking takes a lot less energy when your food is unprocessed, especially if you grow and harvest the food yourself. In addition, by using organic and sustainable foods, you’re helping to decrease the amount of pesticides and hormones that you and your family consume. By not eating meat, you’re also decreasing the amount of grain and grain byproducts.\nGo electric. Instead of using paper, you could use one of the new power-based or electronic options for your cards and mementos. With these, you just print out the card on your computer and print directly on the box. If you aren’t a printer or you prefer to make your cards by hand, you can hand write them and print them on plain white paper. You can buy postcards or have a family member hand make the postcard.\nBuy second hand. Since your gifts will come from handmade or recycled sources, you can also think about buying gifts that have been previously owned. These are a great way to help you and your family and friends save on your gifts.\nCut down on buying additional holiday items. You can cut down and reduce on your electric bill by reducing the amount you use in your new ornaments, lights, tree, decorations, ornaments, and so on. If you’re not ready to give up your tree, consider cutting it back a bit or replacing it with a pine tree. If you’re willing to give up your tree altogether, you can opt for some lights around your windows or candles instead. In general, the most energy-efficient decorations are the ones that don’t have too much decoration and are kept on a timer that’s turned off at midnight. With this option, you always know when it’s time to turn on your lights. These timers can even be used for your outside lights.\nWhen you turn on your lights, unplug them and turn them off when you’re done using them. This will help to save your electricity while you’re using the lights. You also won’t be using unnecessary power to keep the lights on.\nIn addition, when you’re unplugging your decorations, don’t keep them plugged into the outlet. Instead, bring their cords with you. You can then plug them into your regular outlet when you’re ready to turn them on and off. This can also help you keep from burning down your house from an overloaded outlet or from other accidents this way.\nThese are the perfect way for you to make sure you’re spending a few dollars to make an impact on the environment. These practices can make holiday planning so much more eco-friendly. You won’t feel guilty when you spend so little on your holiday and you can pass the holiday savings on to other people you want to give gifts to. Just make sure that you’re recycling, composting, and buying second hand and homemade wherever possible."

        "output": "There are many creative projects we can build at home that are related to the given theme, so let's list some of them.\n\nTheme: Circuits / LEDs\n\n## 1 Connect a circuit to an LED\n\nIf your kids are too young to use soldering, or you have no experience with circuits, use this approach. It has a few advantages:\n\n  *   You don't have to worry about the wire going through the soldering iron. Kids can easily connect the wire to a LED themselves.\n\n  *   No soldering! You only need to connect two wires with copper tape with a wire in the middle.\n\n  *   You don't need any technical skills, so you can build circuits together from the beginning.\n\n  *   You can still use soldering. For example, you can connect the wires with tape yourself before your child's birthday party and show them their circuit on the big LED board.\n\n### Parts\n\n  *   Circuit board, such as these 3V LEDs (you can also use 5V LEDs, in which case you need a regulator)\n\n  *   LED (for the 3V circuits you need, you can use the smaller 3V or even 1.2V LEDs like this)\n\n  *   Wire\n\n  *  copper tape (you can also use copper wire to connect to the LED – this is important to prevent a shock)\n\n### Steps\n\n  1.  [+] To connect the wires to the circuit you can use tape, as shown below.\n\n  2.  [+] Or connect the LEDs directly using a wire. Then you can use the tape on each wire to cover the wire end.\n\n  3.  [+] Your circuit is now finished – you can insert it into the big LED board.\n\n  4.  [+] Let's build more advanced circuits.\n\n## 2 Build a circuit with 3 LEDs\n\n### Parts\n\n  *   Circuit board, such as this 3V circuit for LEDs\n\n  *   Copper tape\n\n  *   Wire\n\n### Steps\n\n  1.   [+] Connect the wire to the LEDs on the circuit board.\n\n  2.  [+] Your circuit is now finished – you can insert it into the big LED board as a stand-alone circuit.\n\n  3.  [+] Of course, you can connect more wires to the circuit. For example, you can connect the LEDs in different colors or different circuits.\n\n## 3 Build an LED flash with an IR emitter\n\nWe'll use these two parts again:\n\n  *   IR emitter\n\n  *   3V LED\n\n### Parts\n\n  *   Circuit board, such as this 3V circuit for LEDs\n\n  *   Copper tape\n\n  *   3V LED\n\n  *   IR emitter\n\n### Steps\n\n  1.   [+] On the circuit board there are three sockets for the LEDs in different colors. Connect the IR emitter to socket C.\n\n  2.  [+] Connect your flashlight to socket A, and the LED to socket B.\n\n  3.  [+] The circuit is now finished – you can insert it into the big LED display and turn it on. What do you think you'll see?\n\n## 4 Make a circuit with two LEDs and two switches\n\n### Parts\n\n  *   Circuit board\n\n  *   Two LEDs such as these 5V LEDs\n\n  *   Copper tape\n\n  *   Two switch switches\n\n### Steps\n\n  1.  [+] Connect two circuit boards in series as shown below.\n\n  2.  [+] Connect a wire from each LED to one of the switches – like this LED for the first switch and the other LED for the second.\n\n  3.  [+] Connect a wire from each switch to the other switch – like this 1, 0 switch.\n\n  4.   [+] Your circuit is now finished – you can insert it into the big LED display.\n\n## 5 Build a circuit with 10 LEDs\n\nThe next circuit will build on the ones you've previously built; we'll connect more circuits to the last one. As usual, we'll use these parts:\n\n  *   Circuit board, such as these 3V LEDs\n\n  *   Copper tape\n\n  *   Wire\n\n  *   LED\n\n### Parts\n\n  *   Circuit board, such as this 3V circuit for LEDs\n\n"

The cup the coffee is measured in.\n  2. An analog meter that measures coffee darkness.\n\nThe main part is a 3\" cube, made from 1/4\" plywood. This is the base on which the entire coffee cup will be placed,\nand the location of the hole for the ananlog meter.\nThe size is large enough that the base won't be in the way of the measurement.\n\nThe second part is a brass meter that's 5 3/16\" tall, 4\" across at the widest point, and has a radius of 2\"\nin the middle of the bar.\nOn the top it will be a round hole of exactly 2\".\n\nThe black color of the \"meter\" is to match the black color of the cup.\n\nBuilding Instructions for Cup\n----------------------------\n\nThis step is optional, but the result will give you an attractive, sturdy cup.\n\nMeasure out all of the cut material (4\" squares, 2-5/8\" squares, 1/8\" x 2\" strips) using your scale for the final size.\n\nAssemble the 2 4\" squares into a square that is exactly 8-5/8\" on a side, and\nassemble the 2 2-5/8 squares into a square that is exactly 8\" on a side\n\nAssemble the sides of the box using the 1-8\" squares. You will end up using one of the strips on every side.\n\nThe sides of the box will be 4-1/8\" tall, 4 7/8\" wide, and have an aperture that is 3-5/8\" across in the middle.\n\nDrill a hole in the middle of the top of the box, with a diameter of 2-1/4\".\n\nNow you are ready to glue the interior parts together.\n\nPut the interior parts inside the box, and make sure everything is centered.\nGently place the box on a flat surface, and put a few ounces of weight on the inside.\nWhen you put weight on the top, it should be quite heavy.\nWhen you put weight on the middle (between the \"fingers\"), the sides should \"climb\" up.\nIf that does not happen, then it is not centered.\n\nDoing it this way, you will be able to adjust the height\nof the cup until it is the correct height for all of your favorite coffees.\n\nWhen it is centered, start gluing.

Let it dry for a week or more.\nThis gives it extra strength.

        "output": "Provide a detailed explanation of the steps that are required in order to construct the given project.\n\nSteam Engine Using an Empty Beer Can\n===================================\n\nA steam engine provides a lot of useful energy, and it is useful for many kinds of things such as cooking food, heating your home, and washing floors or clothes. In this project, you will use a basic steam engine as the basis for creating a cooking device.\n\nWhen you heat up water to a boil, you use a lot of energy in order to do so. Instead, turn this problem upside down: instead of using energy to heat some water up, use energy to cool this water. That way, the steam engine can provide energy to cook your food!\n\nIn order to cook your food, there are a few things that you need to do. Firstly, place your food into a container. This can be as simple as a plastic bag. If you put your food in this container, place a lid on top of it. The container should then be placed into some water, and let sit for several minutes. Use a thermometer to check that the water has reached a temperature of about 80 degrees Celsius.\n\nAt this point, all the water turns into steam in your container. When this happens, the steam will go out of the bottom of the bag (or the lid) and enter a funnel pipe. This pipe in turn is plugged into your steam engine. As the steam passes through the engine, that engine begins to vibrate. Then, that vibration is converted via a speaker into a loud sound.\n\nIn order for the vibrations to generate any useful food-cooking energy, there are two pieces of equipment which you need to use. The first piece are two plywood wedges which sit inside your funnel. These wedges are intended to hold the food into your container as they are vibrating (See Figure 10.1 for an example of these wedges. You can use cardboard or wood wedges to hold your food while it is being vibrated.)\n\nFigure 10.1. A picture of a steam engine that is being used for cooking.\n\nThe second piece of equipment is a metal bucket that is held in place using two rubber bands. This bucket sits upside down on one side of a pot and contains some ground coffee beans. When the bucket inside of this pot is vibrated hard enough, the beans that are inside the bucket will be able to grind themselves into a fine powder. This process happens very quickly.\n\nIn order for your steam engine to vibrate as hard as it can, you will need to attach some kind of sound amplifier. The simplest amplifier that you can do is one that works via a rubber band and a wooden paddle. You can find this kind of amplifier in many of the toys that you find for children. Place a rubber band across your paddle, and place two of your plywood wedges onto one of the ends of your paddle. Use the other end of the rubber band to attach the bucket to your paddle.\n\nAt this point, you can stand your steam engine up vertically or horizontally. Make sure that your funnel opens down into a vertical position and your steam pipe ends up above your steam engine. Then, bring a kettle of water down to a boil and place it next to where the steam pipe enters into the steam engine. After a few minutes, attach your speaker to the bottom of your steam engine just as you have seen in the picture. Then, put a bag of dry, non-dairy ice cubes in the water bath. After about five minutes, you are ready to start the vibrations to get your food cooked.\n\nThe first time that you run this experiment, you will hear a steady kind of high-pitched sound. This sound is the result of the steam escaping from the top of the funnel pipe. This sound should be heard until the water has gone completely cold and become solid ice. When you hear the sound start to go away, insert the bag of ice cubes. When these are fully dissolved, you will hear a louder kind of high-pitched sound. This sound is the result of your steam engine now vibrating.\n\nThe problem with this first attempt is that it may make it too difficult to hear what is going on. The second attempt is a little better: you can run the experiment using an empty beer can.\n\nEmpty Beer Can as a Steam Engine\n=================================\n\nSince the beer cans that you can buy today are plastic or aluminum, your steam engine will not work with that material. You might be able to work with a"

Calculations on the website say it may cost as much as $130. This project is similar to one I did but it doesn't need to contain a refrigerator. I made this water chiller for an aquarium set-up. There are other chiller types such as 3-2 chiller (ice machine + 2 separate water chillers) as well but I haven't created any yet.\n\nDIY Cooling Pack\nRequired items are: 5-18v 3-4amp fan, 3 18v 50-100 amp DC motors, 50W - 180W 12v thermo element, 3w high intensity leds, 5-12v DC relay, 12v power supply w/ fuse, 3x1000ma batteries, a couple of switches, a few connectors, and a bit of cable.\n\nAquaTech Cooling Systems Cooler\nRequired items are: Temperature regulator, 240w AC fan, 24V 600W Peltier plate, fan controller, 12v regulator w/ fuse, motor controller w/ 3dip switch, and 12V 6amp power supply. Calculations on the website say it may cost as much as $350. It is similar to the AquaCooling System that I've also used and made. The idea of this is to make a cooler for your tank but not just to create one that would cool the whole tank. It needs to cool your tank but the rest of your system is to be made with other parts.\n\nDIY 3-2 Chiller\nRequired items: Aquarium pump x 2, Temperature regulator, Ice-maker, 12v regulator w/ fuse, 12v power supply, and 12 volt 40 amp fuse block. I made one of these but it can't operate because it keeps catching on the aquarium's water and has a tendency to fall off the ice-maker. It was basically a tank-mounted fan and two aquarium pumps which helped move the air in and out of the tank. I had them each with own regulator to have the flow rate from each pump be controlled. In the middle was the controller and temperature/ice-maker. There were three switches (two for the pumps and one for the regulator) and one fuse.\n\nDIY Aquarium Chiller\nRequired items are: Aquarium pump x2, Temperature regulator, Ice-maker, and 12v regulator w/ fuse. I made this for an aquarium set-up and only the temperature regulator and ice-maker were used. The idea of this coolant was to have a pump at the top of the tank with a hole in the bottom wall where the controller was located. It used a fan at the entrance to the tank to blow in air and a temperature regulator to let the temperature in or out as it needed to.\n\nDIY Air Conditioning System\n\nRequired items: 2 12v 800w Peltier plates, water cooler controller, water cooler fan controller, 12v regulator w/ fuse, two 12v 9-18v thermo element switches, 12v power supply w/ fuse, switches, and connectors. I made this for an aquarium set-up. The idea of this coolant was to have a pump at the entrance of the tank with a small water cooler at the top, a few fans, and a controller. The water cooler was used to control the temperature inside the enclosure. I use my thermostat at work to take readings. The water cooler was the main component as it controlled the temperature. It did well until I decided that I needed to increase/decrease the water cooler's capacity. Since the water cooler controller would only function for a water cooler of 65/96 degrees and it was designed primarily for aquariums, I had to find a better way to have the controller detect the temperature. I thought of how my thermostat at works which works by having a temp sensor which is set at a specific temperature and a change in the amount of energy the thermostat needs to put out to keep the temperature constant. By adding a thermo element switch at the head of the tank water cooler, I can increase or decrease the amount of energy it takes to hold the temperature because it will be based on the temperature and not have to do the math for each individual switch.\n\nCool"

This chapter explores physical and emotional growth and the role of the parent and teacher in guiding the student to that growth.\n\n### **Chapter Learning Objectives**\n\n  Understand a student's physical and intellectual development\n\n  Understand the role of the educator and the way they can help students grow\n\n  Evaluate how to best support students with emotional and intellectual challenges, based on the principles outlined in this chapter\n\n  Evaluate how to best support students with physical and emotional challenges, based on the principles outlined in this chapter\n\n### **Physical and Emotional Development**\n\n### **Student Learning**\n\nThis chapter focuses on the physical development of students in the K–12 environment. This covers the cognitive, emotional, and social growth of students and how students reach certain milestones in their life. In each state, students meet certain milestones, depending on the grade range that they are in. For example, fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-grade students must meet certain physical requirements to participate in team sports. All students are required to wear a helmet while playing team sports by the time third grade rolls around, unless they are working on a modified sport or activity. A student's physical development is not only a prerequisite to getting in the game, but it is also an indicator of health and learning development. For example, a student must have basic motor skills to write, which means that the student must be able to sit upright while working. This can cause challenges for some students who have physical challenges.\n\n**WHAT ARE A CHILD'S MORAL AND SOCIAL REVGULS?**\n\n> They consist in the habit of doing right.... Our moral feelings are nothing but our natural affections.... But, as our affections advance, and as our senses become more acute, so our affections become more extensive and refined.\n\n—Immanuel Kant\n\nIn addition to their physical development, children must learn to develop as moral, civil, and social individuals. Social development starts with the family and teachers at home and school. A child's moral development begins at the age of five and progresses throughout life (see Figure 5.1).\n\n**FIGURE 5.1. A Child's Moral Development  \n(Courtesy of OpenStax, _Principles of Psychology_ by Roy R. Griggs [CC BY 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons)**\n\n_Source:_ OpenStax, _Principles of Psychology_ by Roy R. Griggs [CC BY 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nA child's social development is based on the way others treat that child. Sometimes, children with special needs may find themselves the butt of the jokes of their peers or may be left out of the mainstream activities of their school. What are they supposed to do? Do they join in with their peers, or do they stay away from them? How does or should someone with Asperger's Syndrome, for example, react to these circumstances? There is no right answer. Children must learn on their own how to deal with these circumstances or with others who may be mean to them.\n\nChildren learn and advance as moral and social beings from two sources: the family and the peer group. Each child is nurtured by different family and peers. Some children may have a very supportive family and a good circle of friends who are sensitive and caring. Sometimes children have to learn how to deal with negative situations at home, or they may be teased and bullied at school by their classmates. These occurrences in a child's life shape that child into the adult he or she will later become.\n\n### **Parents as a Learning Environment**\n\nMany students are not fortunate enough to have parents who want them to succeed or understand what they need, and these students struggle in school and at home—and they often do not progress beyond the classroom.\n\nIn fact, it is very difficult for students with special needs to get and retain the kind of help they need and need at home. There often is a sense of hopelessness among these students because nothing seems to happen when they try to ask for help so they begin to lose their motivation. This often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy for them, leaving them uninterested and disinterested in their schooling and their personal lives.\n\nIf a student with a disability"

        "output": "Give me an idea of the mental exercises you do to inspire yourself.\nI have always been an avid reader and still am and in my case I have to say there have been some very different books, but my favorites are biographies. I love reading about people and I think they inspired me to be open-minded and to see things from many different perspectives. To this day I’m still trying to understand myself and find peace with the fact that I don’t know everything. It’s like putting your puzzle together. I like the mystery that comes with that. I’ve always loved watching movies, especially musicals, so that has always been a big part of my life as well. It takes me on a journey that I can identify with or in the way I see life – a lot of life is like that.\nWhich book are you reading right now?\nThere are so many good books out there. What I’m reading right now I think is very inspirational and amazing is, “Unbroken”.\nWhat role does music play in your life?\nI was listening to music since I can remember. It is a big part of my life. I listen to music on a daily basis. Music is like food to me, I have to have it. It’s part of culture and is universal as well. It’s amazing. It’s just a part of who I am. It’s an addiction to me. It’s like a therapy for me in a way.\nWhat music would you say has been an influence on you?\nI think we all come from different places but I think all of us feel music in different ways. We all have different backgrounds and we all feel it in different ways. It’s a universal language, I would hope. All kinds of different stuff… I also sing classical music and I love playing a concerto. It’s not only rock ‘n roll or punk rock. It’s very different.\nTo follow up on your last question, if you had to pick any three artists to have on a desert island what artists would you pick?\nIt’s such a difficult question.\nAlicia Keys, Prince, Madonna\nYour first album “Under the Big Orange Sky” came out in 2010. What do you think was the best song from the first album?\nI think “Gone” is one of my favorite songs on the album. It’s a cover song but we put our own little spin on it. We decided to bring the song back to life because it’s a 90s song that everyone has heard and everyone has a connection to it. We tried to do a cover where we could put an acoustic spin on it and tried to capture that spirit; I really think it turned out great.\nWhat are you working on now?\nWe put together a very cool album and I would really like to talk about that. We are very pleased and excited to have the new album “Into the Black”. It’s the first album I’ve put out that’s truly a collection of songs I can say that I wrote by myself. It’s a very unique story and I think everyone who listens to the album will be able to attach themselves to a particular song.\nWhat was it like going into the Blackhouse to record your album?\nIt’s definitely something new for me. I was so glad that I chose Blackhouse because I think this album will make us more famous; everyone will know us. It wasn’t just anyone making this album. It was Blackhouse and they have this wonderful history of music. The studio and everything about it… It’s like a castle and it’s made of wood. It’s very quiet. Just being there is almost like being in a museum. We all had a lot of fun. It was a very good experience, very good.\nWhat was it like working with your brothers and sisters?\nIt’s been like nothing else is going to come after that. My brothers and sisters are the best thing to go with. I have four brothers and three sisters and I think we all get along really well and even though we grew up being separated by some time and our parents split up, but we make it work. Being apart for a while is fine. We each did the same. It was nothing new. We had great childhood and now it’s a great family.\nDo those childhood memories come out when you’re writing music?\nSome of my songs are about things that happened in my childhood. For example, “Gone” was about my grandfather who passed away in Jamaica from cancer. I was there and I wanted to dedicate that song to him. I think about my grandfather and my grandmother. It’s a very touching song and I think that was very special to all of us. Every time we remember something, we would tell each other, “We have to write a song about this"

        "output": "Plan an agenda for the daily standup meetings. Assign a time duration to each topic on the agenda. For example, you would not want to spend a day just discussing the issues in a company, but youâ€™d use an hour or so to go over the problems and opportunities arising.\nSet up a timer so your team knows when their time is up when theyâ€™re talking.\nUse this schedule to plan todays meeting.\nMake sure that everyone in the meeting knows what they have to do after the meetings. Have a brief â€œfollow-upâ€ to the â€œthis is your follow-up agendaâ€ part of every meeting. Explain the process for solving any issues which might occur at the next meeting.\nYou wonâ€™t know what you have to remember from your meetings until you have a few of them under your belt, so try to be as thorough as possible in the first few meetings. Thatâ€™s the real purpose of the meeting: to gather up all the information, organize it, plan it, and remember it for the next week.\nYour first few standups and meetings will be the most difficult. It will be hard for everyone to get used to being on time, answering the questions, discussing their work, and taking notes. This is especially true for those who have not attended standups before, or who havenâ€™t been part of any meetings in a while. Be patient and kind with your team. The more you give and the less you ask, the more theyâ€™ll want to be there and do their best.\nItâ€™s very important to get your team in the habit of standing up and sharing.\nIt will take everyone involved in your company a few meetings to get used to being at your meetings, answering questions, and finding their way through the structure you have built. This is normal and acceptable.\nItâ€™s always good to have an agenda for each meeting, but in your first few meetings, youâ€™ll probably use an â€œas neededâ€ agenda. If you have a problem on one day, you can address it at that dayâ€™s meeting. If you have a big issue that your team needs to go over, you should do that at a meeting with your whole team.\nYour first few meetings will be devoted mostly to getting your process down, and getting your team to respond to your meetings.\nYour first few meetings should be more collaborative than the meetings you have now.\nDo you currently manage by numbers? A lot of teams are â€œmanagedâ€ by tracking progress of their work in columns, each column is filled with a number. Those numbers, you can see, reflect the current workload in the company.\nTo give you a more granular overview of the actual work in your company, we have created a spreadsheet which allows you to track everything that your team has done in the past week. Itâ€™s designed to give you a more in-depth look at exactly how busy you are, and how your team is working together to complete all the tasks you need to do.\nThe spreadsheet will enable you to track your goals and progress towards those goals.\nIt allows you to see and compare information for each of your tasks and deliverables.\nTo see this sheet, simply click on the image or link to the sheet below.\nYou can track your progress as far back as you want. To the right of the spreadsheet you can see a list of all the dates you have selected.\nIf you want to see the tasks for a date in the past, click on your date in the table, and then click on â€œChange datesâ€ on the red bar at the top of the table on the right.\nThen click on the box next to the date you want to see tasks for, and then youâ€™ll be able to track the tasks you have completed and those youâ€™re still doing.\nIf you want to see this information in a daily, rather than a weekly view, follow the same procedure, except that youâ€™ll be looking at things like â€œtodayâ€ or â€œYesterday.â€ In the spreadsheet you would see a list of all the days in a particular time period (for example, one month, or yesterday), then you would click on the correct day to view the events for it, and you get a daily view of your work. Clicking that day would get you a view of all the tasks and work youâ€™ve done.\nNow that you can track your teamâ€™s deliverables in such detail, you will be able to ask your team to create more meaningful deliverables, using the information available in the spreadsheet. This way you can control what gets delivered, when, and who is responsible for completing it.\nWith this system in place, youâ€™ll have a clear view into your work and into your teamâ€™s work. This"

Each syllable is a step on the way to mastering your perfect French pronunciation. Just like the first seven steps of a staircase, each step is one more than the previous one.\n\nIn a normal conversation, French speakers generally say no more than three syllables per word, so that 7-step formula will be perfect for all of your French pronunciation needs. If, for some reason, you need to say more than three syllables in a single word, just say it like you normally wouldand don't worry about this 7-step formula.\n\nIf you start with the right foundation, pronouncing three syllables is not difficult at all. If you use it consistently, you'll soon get used to speaking three syllables without even thinking about it.\n\nAnd to make things easier, I have prepared a pronunciation chart for all of the words, phrases and sentences you'll find in the entire book so you can practice your new French pronunciation at any time.\n\nIn the next two sections, I will give you the steps to pronounce just five common French words:\n\n> * \"Hello\"\n> * \"How are you\"\n> * \"Thank you\"\n> * \"You're welcome\"\n> * \"Do you speak English\"\n\nAnd then I will teach you how to pronounce all of the words, phrases, and sentences found in the book.\n\n### Step 1: Ai  \npronounced _AYE_\n\n_You say_ \"How do you say\" _after you greet somebody._\n\n_Good Morning: Bonjour_\n\n_Good Evening: Bonsoir_\n\n_Good Night: Bonsoir_\n\n### Step 2: Noh  \npronounced _NOY_\n\n_\"Ahhhh.\" This word sounds like the 'ah' in 'ah, man!'.

But once you try popcorn flavored with a little butter, salt, and melted yellow mustard, you'll want to think of it as an everyday treat instead of a \"something to do while watching a film\". The trick is to make sure you melt the mustard first so it has the chance to completely saturate the butter and popcorn, so you get a little more mustard flavor to start with. This ensures that there's nothing sticking to the side of the pot, and instead, the buttery mustard flavor gets soaked up by every kernel of popcorn.\n\n# 204.

A chewy cookie provides you with that crunch and bite and is perfect for any time you need a quick energy boost. It also packs a good dose of flavor. This recipe is simple and it is quick: no long boiling or kneading required. The ingredients are simple, and the steps are straight forward.\n\nINGREDIENTS | YIELDS: ABOUT 30 COOKIES\n\n1 cup water\n\n3 sticks salted butter\n\n1 cup brown sugar\n\n1 medium banana, mashed\n\n1 egg\n\n3 cups oat flour\n\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n\n1 cup dark chocolate chips\n\nPREPARATION:\n\nTo begin, in a pot, combine the water and butter and heat over low-medium heat until the butter has melted. With a candy thermometer, stir until the temperature reaches 240°F. At this point, remove the pot with the butter mixture from the heat and set it aside to cool.\n\n10 MINUTES LATER:\n\nMeanwhile, mix brown sugar, banana, and egg in a bowl and set aside.\n\n1 HOUR LATER:\n\nPlace the cooled butter and water mixture in a bowl or mixer, and add the oat flour, baking powder, and chocolate chips. Pour the brown sugar mixture into the bowl and mix completely.\n\nBake cookies for 17–20 minutes in the oven at 300°F. Transfer them to a cooling tray.\n\nHow Do You Know If the Butter Has Melted?\n\nA sugar thermometer is typically used to know when the sugar crystals have melted. The thermometer should be inserted into the boiling mixture; then, you should observe the color of the sugar when it reaches a certain temperature. For this recipe, you need a clear (not pink or red-colored) temperature of 240°F.\n\nIs the Sugar Crystal Red Now That It Is Melting?\n\nIf you see any color change in the boiling sugar, this means that the temperature is too low or that you have the wrong sugar thermometer with you.\n\nWhat Can I Do If I Have A Low-Powered Stove?\n\nThe use of a sugar thermometer is essential. You can either purchase a small high-precision thermometer to match your stove, or you can purchase a device that matches with your stove and uses an infrared light to show you how hot the water or sugar mixture is.\n\n# 4. How Does the Environment Affect Food?\n\nThe Environment's Impact on Food\n\nWe cannot live without oxygen, but a large number of bacteria and other organisms in the air are capable of causing major problems for us humans. These pollutants take many forms, and they come together in what is known as our indoor air quality.\n\nA few organisms in the environment can be toxic, and some can cause serious illnesses that have to be carefully examined by a doctor. But how do we know which substances in nature are harmful to us, and which are not? Let's find out how scientists study these substances.\n\nThe Effects of Pollutants on People\n\nThe effect that every pollutant has on people depends on several factors, including:\n\n  * The amount of pollutant in the air\n  * The length of time of exposure to it\n  * The age and physical health of the people being exposed\n\nIn addition, pollutants can affect everyone in different ways. For example, a substance that can cause a particular illness to you can cause a different illness to someone else. Therefore, it is essential that we understand the effects of these pollutants in order to prevent any problems.\n\nIdentifying the Pollutant\n\nPollutants are substances that have been removed from their natural sources and are now in the environment. They can enter the air from the following processes:\n\n  * By burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas;\n  * By the use of pesticides when farming, or by the disposal of waste;\n  * Any time when we throw waste into a landfill, it mixes with the air; and\n  * From industries that use toxic chemicals or products.\n\nIn addition, there are pollutants that enter the air as a result of natural processes, such as rain on a forest or by rocks reacting with the substances in the earth.\n\nIdentifying Pollutants\n\nPollutants can enter an atmosphere in several ways:\n\n  * By the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal or oil.\n  * By the burning of garbage and other waste products."

The fact is that _The Story of Tristan and Isolde_ was written by the Anglo-Catholic nobleman and author Wilfred Scawen Blunt. Is there another Matilda-type around?\n\nYou get the impression that by doing so she was passing on all she knew about love. In fact, she is preparing to hand on the gift of her heart. Matilda is being given it by the two women in the novel who give her the gift of love.\n\n_The Story of Tristan and Isolde_ is a passionate, passionate novel. As a child Matilda must have wanted to give that to someone. She had to keep quiet about it. As we shall see, that was her job.\n\nThe truth is that she has only discovered after the book has been published that she had in fact fallen in love years before she was even aware of what this was.\n\nIf Matilda had fallen in love in her twenties she might now be married to the two men she had two secret love affairs with in her twenties. But she didn't do anything about it. In her twenties she couldn't give herself full expression to her passions. As she says later, \"I lived for you and you for others. You were my first love. I knew you would come into my life and I would leave mine. I was not ready for my destiny.\"\n\nNow she is free. She has never been free in her life.\n\nThis is a woman who has been brought up to conceal her emotions. She has been trained and encouraged to be obedient rather than passionate.\n\nIt is this passion that she is expressing in the love she shares with another woman in _The Story of Tristan and Isolde_ by Wilfred Scawen Blunt.\n\nBy the time I read _The Story of Tristan and Isolde_ for the first time in the 1990s I felt like I was reading my life story.\n\nWhen Matilda is finally at the age for love and freedom, she falls in love for the first time and goes off to Oxford university with her friend Beatrice.\n\nMatilda is excited by the prospect of going to university where she will share love and books for the first time and she will get away from her mother.\n\nHer mother is far more interested in her career than she is in what her daughter wants. Matilda says when she turns thirty her mother \"flipped a switch and my life began to revolve around you.\" But her mother is only now beginning to realise that she was the one who had prevented Matilda from having this life.\n\nMatilda is thrilled to be going to that great university with her first friend.\n\nAnd then her mother's jealousy is revealed when the other woman in Matilda's life, Beatrice, whom she loves, turns out to be of a noble family at Oxford.\n\nMatilda's mother's response is to encourage her daughter to turn down Oxford University because of this woman's money.\n\nAnd so Matilda turns down Oxford University and goes to the \"university\".\n\nWhile she is in this place, of course, she meets her first love, Rose, and the story of this love is the best-kept secret Matilda has ever had. We will discuss that later.\n\nAt the time of _The Story of Tristan and Isolde_ Matilda has been in a double-secret relationship with a married woman called Rose for seven years. They are engaged but their affair is kept secret.\n\nIt has taken this long because Matilda has to be in the place to share in Rose's love with the world and her family. The love she has with Rose is for them but, at the same time, if she meets Prince Prince in Paris, she will leave them for him.\n\n\"I have a love for Rose that is incomparable,\" she tells her father when she first begins to see that she has fallen in love with Prince Prince (who has been called Prince Prince).\n\nThe truth is that Matilda and Rose have been very careful never to bring their relationship out into the open and Matilda has been careful not to tell anyone about it.\n\nThis book has already been published before we get to Oxford University. After _The Story of Tristan and Isolde_ was published in 1954, Matilda knew that by telling people about her true love they might think she was mad"

That is, it fits into its genre.\n\nA book that belongs in this category is a work of literature of a specified genre, like a mystery novel or an historical novel.\n\nWe can also write: this is a \"one of\" book in its history of literature, meaning as a book that fits into its literary-cultural tradition or genre. This genre-based way of speaking can be quite complex, but we will get into it a bit later in this chapter.\n\nFor now we can imagine that you say,\n\nThis is a \"one of\" mystery novel.\n\nThe book is also a \"one of\" classic mystery novel. You can also distinguish these two, as they both fit into the category \"classic English novel.\"\n\nA second \"one of\" book genre would be, say, the genre-of-travel-narratives.\n\nThere is also a group of books that may call into question our very idea of what a book is: works of self-help, how-to books, and so on. These fall into the \"one of\" category.\n\nOne should also include the book about books, a genre that you can read about in, for example, The Making of Mark Twain, by Mark Perry.\n\nNote that sometimes you will hear, \"This is a book about books, a work of literary criticism,\" which is confusing. As we discussed in our overview of books, and especially in terms of literary quality, there are works of literary criticism, but that term refers only to the subject and not the type of book being discussed.\n\nIn the category of \"one of\" a book, you can also separate out works of literature that appear on the list of required reading or recommended reading on a given book's cover. As soon as one reads that, it becomes \"one of\" one's assigned book(s). I am not saying that all such books do not belong in literary tradition; they can, of course, very much, but the fact that they are required or recommended means they represent a significant part of your education.\n\nSo far we have looked at \"one of\" books, which belong to the literature of their time, in particular in a literary culture or tradition of that time. We need now to differentiate between \"one of\" and \"a part of.\" Many of the books included in the category can have a literary tradition, but they do not belong to the traditions or genres that belong to \"one of\" literary works. Consider the following examples from the \"best books ever\" lists you should have received over the years. As you read, try to separate each book into \"one of\" vs. \"a part of\":\n\nOne of the most remarkable books ever written, perhaps the greatest story about friendship in the English language, a book that makes you smile and laugh and cry all at once, The Importance of Being Earnest is an absolute pleasure for both first-time and lifelong readers. Wilde's wit and the sharpness of his writing make this a brilliant comedy. But there is more to this classic English comedy of manners than just a delightful tale of mistaken identities and a romantic subplot. Wilde also writes one of the most important anti-sexual prejudices plays of all time, showing society's hypocritical rules of propriety that demand that homosexuals live in a \"bachelor\" way while heterosexuals live in the context of marriage and family.\n\nTo read this book as entertainment is to miss the great power of Wilde's wit; he uses humor like a weapon, using it as the main way to attack society's \"unfair\" rules and \"loyalty\" that only go one way. An important book for a first reading and for rereading, The Importance of Being Earnest reminds the reader that comedy, in particular, is one of the most powerful ways to expose the hypocrisies or injustices of an unjust society.\n\nAn important play for high school students needs to include this novel comedy (which is often the best of Wilde's work and was a huge success in its 1895 first run, only to be banned from the London stage because Wilde was now seen as politically radical and a homosexual). It is also not a \"fairy-tale\" comedy like The Merry Wives of Windsor or A Midsummer Night's Dream but a comedy that exposes the hypocris"

        "output": "Prove the given statement using your information.\n\n\"If x is a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4, then x>0 and x>12.\"\n\nTo begin, note that, in general, given a statement of the\nform \"If x is A, then y is B\" the conclusion is: if A, then B.  As\nan example, we would say that:\n\n- If you have 10 or more hours in reserve in your schedule,\n then you can take the class that is 4 units.\n- If you have 10 or more hours in reserve in your schedule,\n then you can take any class.\n\nThis means that 0 is not possible.  So, this statement is true.\n\nNext, we notice:\n\n- If x is a positive integer,\n- If x+3>4,\n- Then x is at least 3.\n\nThis means that if x < 4 then x is less than 3, so x can't be\ngreater or equal to 40.\n\nSo now that we've eliminated the number 40, are we sure that\nx is a negative integer?  If it's a negative integer, then we're\ndone.\n\nNo!  Why?  Because\n\n- If x+3>4,\n- Then x > 0 and x>12.\n\nSo while we've proven that x can't\nbe greater than 40, we haven't established that x can't be\ngreater than 12.  The question is: If x is > 40, what is x?\nThis is tricky to answer because, if x is anything in the range\n|x| > 40, we don't know which way x is pointing.  So, we can't\nuse x.x <= 40 as a good enough answer, it's not a complete\nanswer.  We've proven some of the information in this problem,\nbut we haven't answered all of the information.\n\nNow, 40 is 7 units away from 0, so the smallest x that gets us\nfrom 40 to 0 is x=-13.\n\nSo that means that, since\n\n- If x+3>4,\n- Then x > 0 and x>12.\n\nwe know that\n\n- If x < 13,\n- Then x is a negative integer and x>12.\n\nWhen we say \"If x < 13, then x is a negative integer and x>12,\"\nwe mean that:\n\n- If x < -12,\n- Then x is a negative integer and x>12\n\nor, since all x < -12 have x > 40:\n\n- If x < -12,\n- Then x>40 and x>12\n\nor, since all x < -12 have x > 40:\n\n- If x < -12,\n- Then x is a negative integer and x>12\n\nThis means that, if you have x < -12, you are sure that x is\na negative integer and x > 12.\n\nWhat's the value of x=40?  Well, when we say that x>40, we mean\nthat x is at least 40.  So, since this is true for all x > -16,\nwe can say that:\n\n- If x > 40,\n- Then x is at least 40.\n\nFinally, that is, if x > -13, we can say that:\n\n- If x > 40,\n- Then x is at least 40.\n\nHooray for solved problems!"

If we square this value, it becomes positive so this quantity does not become equal to that positive value of itself. The k^2 component of the statement becomes k^2 and with 0 as the value of k, this reduces to k^2 = 0, which is true at any integer. The 2k component becomes k+k/1 and with 0 as the value of k, this becomes k + k/1. In order for k+k/1 to be a rational fraction, both k and k/1 have to be rational integers, which means that k is also a rational integer. So it is sufficient to provide an integer k such that k^2 + 2k + 1 = 0. When we get some value of k such that \nk^2 + 2k + 1 = k^2 + (2k/1) + 1 = 0,\nwe will have the value of k such that k^2 + 2k + 1 = 0\nProof: It is possible to choose the integer k = -1.\nSince k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2 + k, then:\n(k+1)^2 + k = 0,\n(k+1)^2 = -k,\n\nFor any integer k,\n\nProof: This is the proof of the statement.\n==================================\nIf you have any other good ideas or methods, please let me know.

It is only just now that the public has begun to rebel against this false teaching and begin to take back the culture given to them. From time immemorial when children were old enough to leave their parents, they were taken to a master (or mistress) from whom they received what is called an education. This did not mean that they became civilized. This meant simply that the master made it his career to train them to know how to earn a living. The purpose of education was the same at the time of Chaucer and the same today. Chaucer called his school an \"academye,\" which means \"a place where people are trained to be good craftsmen.\" He also calls them \"scholegeyers,\" which is an odd word. We would think of a school as a place where you go to learn. But a scholegeyer is one who teaches you what are called \"academies,\" or skills. He is not a person who teaches you what we call \"school,\" the word that we use for education. His job is a craftsman's job. His job is to impart knowledge to the boys who will become apprentices.\n\nThis has not changed very much over the years. Most education up to the first World War was not education, it was crafts training and the result was a society which had no real culture. It was a society in which almost everybody had to do work that was not important, and the important people had no real knowledge of the world. You were taught to be an artisan and not to be an individual. You were trained to do the same as every other artisan and so to produce good work.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe 24th word is \"craft.\" Words are put in order from left to right, with \"d\" on top. The 16 words on the left in Table 1 are placed below the 7 words on the right when reading out loud.\n\nTable 1\n\nThe 25th word is \"important.\"\n\n## Problem 8\n\nWrite out the English alphabet using letters from the letters in the word \"cat.\"\n\n## Solution\n\nYou can get 28 of the letters from the letters in the word cat. The letters after the first \"t\" are the first 5 of the letters in the word.\n\n## Problem 9\n\nThere are many names and expressions which can be considered \"words,\" such as \"Sylvia Plath,\" \"the Mafia,\" \"the United Kingdom,\" and \"Tiffany.\"\n\n(a)\n\nWhat is the minimum number of letters which must be used to make a word?\n\n(b)\n\nIn the word \"Mafia,\" what is the position of the vowels?\n\n## Solution\n\n(a)\n\nA word may contain as many letters as you like.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Mafia consists of a consonant followed by a few vowels, followed by another consonant.\n\n## Problem 10\n\nThe letter sequence \"a b c d e f g...\" is called a 'permutation'. The word 'permutation' has 11 letters and does not have any of the letters \"e, q, y.\" Given this fact, find the smallest number n for which a sequence of n letters that does not contain the letter 'e', can be formed by the permutation sequence \"a b c d e f g....\"\n\n## Solution\n\nIn English the five vowels are i, e, a, o, u. A permutation has 11 letters so the other six must be consonants. The first letter must be an a. The next five (or six) letters can be any of the remaining six and so, must be any two of b (or p or f), c, d, g, or h. At least one of these letters must then come in a subsequent letter. The only alternative for the next six (or five) letters is m, n, or r. This leaves one slot"

In addition, in professional baseball, players in the first or second year of their professional baseball career have \"rookie\" contract protection from free-agent contracts. As a result, some players enter professional baseball as highly-drafted amateurs with the expectation to gain control of a MLB team's draft pick if they are released, whereas other amateur players \"sign\" an entry-level contract for less money.\n\nA professional contract is a \"minor league\" contract, even if the player has already made it to the MLB or \"made it to the show\". Professional players may have other types of contracts, such as the \"prearbitration player under the rule 5 agreement.\" A player, such as Roger Clemens, who has reached arbitration eligibility, will either have a \"team-friendly\" arbitration contract, or be \"on the trading block\" to be bought out of his team's contract obligation.\n\nMinor league contract \n\nThe player's first contract is usually a \"minor league\" contract. A player under a \"minor league\" contract will start as a \"rookie in the minor leagues,\" and will likely be paid a \"starter's salary\" with a limited \"bonus structure.\" These contracts have incentives such as \"statistics,\" \"performance, and \"promotion.\" As a result, the \"players\" on such contracts are treated to the MLB like minor leaguers.\n\nFor example, a team might have a \"rookie contract\" with the \"outstanding\" player, which can have a \"no trade\" clause. That will keep that player from being traded to another team unless he agrees to it.\n\nMinor league players are paid according to their \"status\" in the minor leagues. For example, rookie/develop players earn the least salaries. If they receive more than \"160,000 dollars\" in bonuses, then they will have their professional contracts altered. A \"minor league\" contract can include \"incentives\" such as signing bonus, \"statistics,\" \"performance,\" and \"promotion.\" These types of incentives have some \"limitations\" such as a \"minimum \"160 players\" and \"maximum 1\" bonus.\n\nMinor league contract rules \n\nThe player's first professional contract will be \"a minor league\" contract, and will often be followed by a second \"major league\" contract. The player is \"an amateur\" until he signs a professional contract. The \"MLB can make major league contract proposals\" before he signs his first \"minor league\" contract, but that is not required.\n\nA player's \"developmental\" professional contract will have \"incentives,\" including \"signing bonuses,\" \"statistics,\" \"performance,\" and \"promotion.\" A player's professional contract will most likely include a \"minimum of $160,000\" in \"signing\" bonuses.

However, people with disabilities need so much more than mobility. To them, wheelchairs are life-altering. When a person in a wheelchair needs services on the sidewalk, their needs are so many times greater than the needs of a non-disabled person. Because of their disability, they have unique needs, as well as challenges.\n\nHere are twenty tips for tipping a wheelchair service by Tara Tomashewsky. Please feel free to share these tips with others, too, so that all of us do our part to include and encourage people who need it most.\n\n# 20 TIPS FOR TIPPING WHEELCHAIR SERVICES\n\n  1. Make eye contact with them.\n\n  2. Call them by their name.\n\n  3. Smile.\n\n  4. Show that you are truly making eye contact.\n\n  5. Offer help, if asked.\n\n  6. Praise them for any personal accomplishments you can think of.\n\n  7. Say thank you.\n\n  8. Use words like \"You're Welcome,\" \"It was my pleasure,\" or \"I'm here to help.\"\n\n  9. Offer to help them return the favor.\n\n  10. Look up and see them before you exit through the door.\n\n  11. Go in person to your employer and tell them about the wheelchair service and ask if you can help, and get a referral.\n\n  12. Ask for ideas about how you can help.\n\n  13. Talk more than necessary about the person's wheelchair.\n\n  14. Go beyond the \"thank you\""

Google also works like a spider or a robot.\n+  When you do a search, Google visits all the pages it thinks have the keywords you are looking for, in order to answer your questions.  \n+  Sometimes your search will ask a lot of questions. Google will try to find the best answers for the questions and to put them in a logical order.  \n+  Here is a common conversation:  \n- What is 2+2?  \n- 4.  \n- How much is one pound?  \n- How heavy is a car?  \n- How much does a car cost?  \n+  Google finds a website which has a good answer to all of these questions.  \n+  It goes through all of them step by step, answering your questions.\n+  Google also crawls and scrapes all kinds of non-human information.  \n+  It looks for videos, images, and other information that might have some value to you, and collects it.\n+  It also looks for websites that contain information relevant to other websites it has found.\n  - The more information Google has, the better it can answer your questions.\n  - So, if Google visited many websites, like the one you are looking at, it can find your information more easily.\n  - Google also searches on all of your devices.\n    + It will look for information on all computers and mobile devices, so that all search results are the same everywhere.  \n    + This means that if you are on a mobile phone and look for the \"Pokémon Go\" app, Google may try to locate it for you on other devices.\n    + All of this looks good if Google can find these additional devices.  \n    + But not always, and sometimes things don't work.\n\n## The bots I want to create\n\n+  I want to create bots that answer questions using text.  \n+  This could be for a personal website, or it could be done inside a larger website like Facebook, Twitter, or even Google.\n+  The bot could be called \"Ask Me Anything bot\", or something else.\n+  A \"bot\" could also be created for any other program, like a mobile app.\n  - For example, a bot could work with an app that can locate Pokémon Go.\n  - This bot could be used inside the app to make the game easier, or possibly more fun.\n+  My own bots will work by following a list of directions to answer questions.  \n  - This means that they **can't think outside of these instructions**.\n+  Most web bots are created to answer a large number of questions.\n-  Mine will only answer one question.\n+  My new bots will be able to answer a list of different questions.\n- My bots will only answer a single question.\n+  In this case, the bots will just **repeat words from a list**.\n- My bots will repeat words.\n  - This is not true for other bots.\n+  To understand my bots, look at how another bot works, a bai-laji bot.\n+  This website works to give you quick news about bots.\n  - URL\n+  You are now talking to bots-laji.com. So, you say something.\n  - I"

See you tomorrow!\nPerson 1: Okay, see you.\n\nI've seen many posts about natural language processing, but nothing like this.\nMaybe someone can advise me on this topic.\n\nA: The most important thing to realize is that you can never have an \"utterance\" in natural language text - you have a whole text in which you have sentences that are not complete utterances but are \"utterances\". That's because in NLP you have to identify the entities.\n\nA: The basic idea might be to use a simple statistical machine learning method to try to predict whether a given word (or phrase) is a noun (or noun phrase). Once you have a classifier that can effectively identify nouns, then you can do the other steps. For instance, you can ask the classifier something along the lines of \"Does this word or phrase refer to a person?\". Based on the answer, you might do something like \"OK, this word can never be a person; so in this text string, the word and its context will never form a named entity.\" This is a very loose and simple example, which illustrates the idea.\nThere are a lot of resources on Wikipedia and elsewhere like this, but the basic gist is that you define a set of NER tags: Person, Location, Organization, Quantity, Money etc...\nAnd you create a data-set that has a set of different texts or sentences for each NER tag. In your data-set, you will write the sentence with the tag, and you will write the sentence (and the tag) in all the context in which you would like to find the actual target sentence. In other words, you might write\n\nThe teacher bought a pen for 20 dollars.\n\nThe target sentence might be:\n\nThe teacher buys a pen for 20 dollars.\n\nBut you will write:\n\nThe teacher bought a pen for 20 dollars.\nThe teacher bought a pen, and a hat for 250 dollars.\nThe teacher bought things for various students.\n\nOnce you have defined your data set, then you can train a NER classifier. It's not going to be perfect, but you can try to create a classifier that will do reasonably well.\nTo use your example, using this technique (and assuming that you have a good tagging of all your sentences in your data-set) you could then try to identify NERs in an un-tagged and possibly unread natural language text. So for example, for your first example, you might be able to identify that \"person\" is a NER, and then that \"teacher\" is person and \"20 dollars\" is something else. Then the tagger might say \"this section of text is not correct because it doesn't mention a person\". And then you might be able to start saying \"ok, so this part is not correct because it doesn't mention a Person as target but it does mention a teacher. It makes sense, and so this is a person\". This might not work well, but I imagine it would be a starting point."

        "output": "Describe the content of the article in a brief manner.\n\nA study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe researchers also found that a 20-minute exposure to a dim light in the hours before going to bed—as opposed to waking during a light-up night and going to sleep in darkness—led to worse sleep quality, higher heart rate, and increased blood sugar. It was not a dramatic shift in nighttime light exposure that triggered the effects, but an hour or so of exposure early on during the day.\n\nZee, the lead author on the paper, believes that sleep disruption from light exposure has been getting little attention as an area for research in part because sleep lab studies that track such disturbances would require people to come to laboratories, which is costly. But because the light-on/light-off effects on the brain are so potent, it's no surprise they would show up to some degree even in a lab. \"No one does studies inside a sleep lab because it's very difficult to control all the variables,\" she says from her home in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nZee says the effect of light in sleep is more significant than what some experts were expecting. A 2007 study, also published in PLOS Biology and led by Zee, reported a link between light during the evening and an increased likelihood for depression later on in life, even if it didn't necessarily lead to depression itself. Zee says that's because being exposed to light in the evening (along with other factors, such as stress) could alter circadian rhythm, the internal biological clock that regulates sleep, and therefore affect sleep quality and brain activity the following day.\n\nWhile Zee is no medical doctor herself, she says the findings of her recent studies have \"the potential to have an enormous impact on how physicians prescribe sleep.\" Indeed, the first step is getting physicians and general public to better understand light and how it impinges on sleep, she says.\n\n\"Sleep is an area of very little public knowledge,\" she says. \"Everybody sleeps, but they don't know how to structure their lives around it.\"\n\nHer study suggests that people need to be vigilant about light in the evening, which is not something people do consciously, Zee says, because darkness is a comfortable state. In addition, Zee says other research already suggests that it's not just exposure to light at night but rather when we turn off the lights that influences sleep.\n\n\"Studies have shown that if you turn off lights at about two hours into your sleep and leave them off all night, you'll have very poor sleep quality,\" she says.\n\nBut we should be mindful, she says, that turning off the lights early in the evening, at or around the time we want to go to bed, could result in our bodies being tricked into a false alert that the day is over and we should get up. This is how she describes the effect of light on the body after dark: \"If your internal clock is thinking about going to bed, but you feel as though it's day, that's when your internal clock is really confused, and there's a lot of trouble at that juncture.\"\n\nOn top of what appears to be a growing body of research on the effects of light from an experimental sleep lab, Zee says that other studies have shown that people who spend a large amount of time reading by the light of their computer monitor in the evening or watching TV for a prolonged time during the evening are more likely to be depressed or get diabetes than people who opt for a better sleep regimen.\n\nThe bottom line, Zee says, is that we should make conscious efforts to minimize our exposure to bright light in the early evening hours, which she says is a time of day when most of us really don't need it.\n\n\"We don't like when people come up and touch our head,\" she says. \"That makes us feel vulnerable. Even in the darkness, we like to feel safe.\"\n\n—A.J.

The Artist and the Recording Label may be referred to in this Agreement individually as \"Parties\" and collectively as \"Parties.\" Work under this Agreement will begin on March 15, 2022, and will last for the duration of the Agreement. The duration of this Agreement as a whole is 2.5 years, which is split between the Production Period (the first two years), and the Distribution Period (the third year).\n\nThe Record Label is the owner of the master recording on which the Artist will release its work. This Agreement is for production of and distribution of the Artist's upcoming album.\n\nThe Recording Label and Artist have come to an agreement under which the Recording Label will distribute the Artist's work at no charge for the first two years of the duration of this Agreement. After the first two years, the Artist will pay the costs of distribution, as specified in Paragraph H. However, the Artist needs to have a certain amount of units in stock for distribution before the first two years are up. If the Artist has not reached the aforementioned requirement, it will be considered a violation of this Agreement, and the Record Label has the right to suspend distribution for the first two years of this Agreement under Paragraph L.\n\nIt is the Record Label's job to pay for the recording studio to record, edit, and promote the Artist's work. It is also their responsibility to get the album to the relevant stores so that it can be sold there.\n\nThe parties shall divide the costs as follows. The Recording Label will receive 20% of the profits. The Artist's fee is 80%. The Recording Label shall make a weekly distribution on a Tuesday for a period of a month to see if the Artist has earned over $50,000. This will cover the production costs and 50% of promotion. If the Artist earns more than $50,000, it will receive 80% of the earnings on the first Tuesday of each month. The Artist can also get a payout after the two-year production period when the total earnings have reached $1.6 million, in which case 75% of the earnings is paid to the Artist. If the Artist would rather receive all of its earnings at that time, it will receive only half of the earnings for that time, and the remaining half will become its earnings at the end of the production period.\n\n## **Summary**\n\n  * In the contract between a band and a record label, the agreement usually has two parts: the distribution part and the production part. While the first part details what the company will do for the band, the second focuses on what the band will do.\n  * During the production period, the band is under the record label's direction and has to deliver any work or album to them.\n  * During the distribution part, the band may work on anything they want, but may need permission from the company to launch any product.\n\n# A.B.B.A's \"Rock and Roll\"\n\nYou don't have to be a major rock group to have a deal with a record company. However, you have to have a good song to sing, a strong name, some publicity, and enough people who believe in you to make it work. In 2002, the band of young teenagers that would soon be known as A.B.B.A began to look like potential hits.\n\nThe band consisted of four friends who went to high school near San Antonio, Texas: Nathan \"Ned\" Heller, 18; David \"Dave\" Crenshaw, 17; Richard \"Rick\" Sellers, 17; and Nathan \"Nate\" Jones, 18. They'd all been playing together since they were kids, and Ned had already started a recording studio, called the Swami Center, with his father, where all four of them grew up.\n\nThe boys hadn't even been born when The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" topped the charts. However, their parents introduced them to this popular British band and taught them to play the instruments they'd see in these videos. Later, the boys started to play together in high school. They formed a club called Hail! and organized some music festivals, but soon Nate moved to Dallas. Meanwhile, the other three formed a band and named themselves after a Beatles song. The band was called Love and Hate, after the Beatles'"

What's interesting, in order to avoid any legal problems for themselves, they use everything and everyone!\n> \n> On one hand, spammers are trying to make spam as harmless as possible:\n> \n> â¢   \n_a._ Spammers use harmless images; to make it more appealing for you, they use some pictures of nice girls, like those on most greeting cards.\n> \n> â¢   Spammers often provide an information site as a spam destination â this makes it look as if the message is sent by some legit organization; the site is filled with all kinds of information, which is good, but it does a great service for spammers: if the site is infected with some kind of virus, everyone who uses it will be infected, including their customers.\n> \n> â¢   Spammers also use real addresses that belong to some companies â for instance, they may use real addresses of a certain bank, but in a different city. Spammers simply register to these addresses, which they use to distribute their spam.\n> \n> â¢   Spammers also use email clients from various companies. For instance, in 2004, some spammers decided to use Hotmail â which has been banned from spam-related activities on the Internet â for their activities and registered an address that clearly showed where they were. However, this doesn't mean that all Hotmail users get spam.\n> \n> â¢   Spammers also use some legitimate mail services when distributing spam, and even pay for this: it's much easier for them to receive spam at this email address than to create their own.

As you may know, there are many people who are registered as both a male and female with the same name, which is great for spammers â they simply pick up any phone number they like and send you a message: they even call your phone and ask if it's you, then they ask you to confirm you're the person you say you are, that you understand what they're talking about, and so on. However, in the case of legal problems, it's much easier to explain the person with the exact name, but this still doesn't work.\n> \n> â¢   Spammers also try to get access to your data, and to your friends' data, in order to form spam-focused mailing lists â in fact, it's not even necessary to access your and your friends' emails â just by searching for your name on social networks, they get all the information about your friends.\n> \n> â¢   Spammers often make it as easy as possible for you to reply to spam messages. When they receive a spam, they often check whether the email address matches your name. Then they immediately tell you what to do and what to send them to receive a reward.

Letter templates**_\n\nOnce you have a list of all the questions of your clients or members, you might want to create a few sample letters that cover different issues, like cancellation, policy updates, policy updates and cancellation, or policy updates and other changes. Here are three letters that you might want to have ready for your file.

In other words, this insurance is not valid to receive benefits until the next 12 month renewal date. This notice is to inform you that your insurance is no longer valid for receiving benefits on your current dates. You are therefore required to take additional out-of-pocket expenses in the time period until the next renewal.\n\n_**The reason for cancellation:**_\n\nIn case you'd like to request a review of this decision, please contact me directly.\n\nIt's always a good idea to include this information in your letter since it details the reason for cancellation, the cancellation period, and it acknowledges the fact that clients are only covered during this period of time. It also details the insurance in case your clients request your assistance in appealing the cancellation. This is a must if you are expecting to receive payment from the client (i.e. you're asking the client to pay an excess, you're asking your clients to return the policy to you, or if you're requesting a fee for this service). For best results, personalize this letter.\n\n### Other changes to policy/policy renewal notice: _A quick copy for clients_\n\n_**To:**_ Client Name\n\n_**From:**_ Name of Agency\n\n_**Date:**_ ______________________________\n\n_**Subject:**_ Other Changes to Policy/Policy Renewal Notice\n\nDear Client:\n\nDuring the renewal process, we noticed that for _________________________ the following will become effective from ______________________.\n\nYour policy number is _________________, plan number is ________________, and renewal date is _____ or ________________.\n\n_**What changed:**_\n\n**Policy changes**\n\n1. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Changes in claim:**\n\n1. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at _________________________________ (my phone number).\n\nIn this letter, you are sending notice to the client of policy changes, if any. It's also the perfect time to request to be contacted in the future should additional changes occur. For best results, personalize this letter.\n\n### Other changes to policy: _A quick cancellation letter to your client_\n\n_**To:**_ Client Name\n\n_**From:**_ Name of Agency\n\n_**Date:**_ ______________________________\n\n_**Subject:**_ Other Changes to Policy\n\nDear Client:\n\nI am informing you that your insurance is cancelled as of ________________.\n\n_**Policy Numbers:**_\n\nInsurance issued under Policy Number _______________ and Plan Number ________________.\n\nDuring the cancellation period, you were covered by this policy.

Other wise you should probably eat them sparingly. \n\n\nA: The word that is used to describe an avocado is: \n\navocados - the name of two kinds of large green berry-shaped, edible fruits - the Hass avocado and, in particular, the Fuerte avocado - that have a flavor very similar to peeled banana, but with a distinctive odor - strong, sometimes fishy, smelling almost like rotten banana; and when peeled, the interior flesh is very dark red and is a popular vegetable.\n\nSo it's not the avocado itself that is called \"fat\", but the high fat that you might encounter in an avocado, which then can be used as an ingredient in some diet plan, for example.\n\nA: One possible word for this is \"high in\" (in relation to fats)\n\navocado high in calories\n\nAnother option is to use the word \"fat\" but it isn't very descriptive.  It just refers to the fact that the food has a high proportion of fat (in relation to other macronutrients, i.e. proteins and carbs)\n\navocado a high-fat food\n\n\nA: It is not only food items are called \"High in\" anything.\nIt may also be used like: \n\n\n*\n\n*This item can make children learn good English within a month.\n\n\nIt is called as high potency item. Here \"high potency\" or \"high-potency\" is used for products that can have a very intense effect and are considered to have superior quality and/or strength on a particular subject, e.g., a book, a course of study, or any item.\n\n\n*\n\n*High in value means to be higher in price or higher value. \n\n\nExample: \n\nIf we compare other countries with US, they are high in value\n\nSimilar:\n\nLow in value\n\n\n\n*\n\n*High in content means that it contains more information or that it is important. Example: \n\n\n\nThe book about education is high in content.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*High in quality means it is of high quality.

        "output": "You will be required to write a few questions from the given company's interview section.\n\nKohl's Inc. is an American retailer and the third-largest department store chain in the United States.\n\nKohl's Department Stores:\n\nA brief history of Kohl's:\n\nKohl's was founded by Menard's founder and CEO Robert J. Kohl on October 30, 1962, in Northbrook, Illinois and is now headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1962, Kohl opened his first general merchandise store by selling items from his basement in Northbrook. Ten years later, he opened his first standalone department store in Milwaukee. In 1972, the first Kohl's was built in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, and the company became a publicly-traded stock in 1972 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1978, Kohl's began to target low- and middle-income families, an idea that would lead the company to success. As a general merchandise store, Kohl's sold products at a lower price point than other retail outlets. As a result, the brand was an immediate success. They did this by marketing Kohl's as a company that would always be there for customers. The first Kohl's coupon was issued in 1982 to promote a wide range of products at deeply reduced prices. This resulted in Kohl's popularity for its \"always\" low prices and \"never\" late payment policies.\n\nDuring the early-to-mid 1980s, Kohl's underwent several store renovations. In 1988, Kohl's opened its first international store in London. In 1991, after the sale of its discount division to Sears, Roebuck and Co., Kohl's changed their marketing strategy to target customers ages 65 and older by offering a discount in exchange for a signed commitment card. While there was some initial success, the strategy was short-lived as many seniors had already been members of this program, and the other group that the brand was trying to attract, people in their 40s and 50s, were not convinced by the offering. In 1998, Kohl's started to focus on their value and customer services aspects, adding quality assortments, making merchandising changes, cutting prices, and improving services.\n\nIn 2002, Kohl's introduced the Kohl's Brand Value Center, which brought in more brand-name manufacturers for their customers to shop. In 2005, Kohl's began to expand and invest in their online presence and started to sell online in 2002. Also in 2005, Kohl's became the largest seller in the United States of the new electronic devices that did not require a cable, such as the iPods, iPhones, and other devices. In 2005, customers became able to pay for their purchases with credit cards through Kohl's gift cards. This allowed Kohl's to accept any form of payment rather than just cash or checks.\n\nA decade later, in 2015, Kohl's launched their \"Misfit Monday\" campaign, which focused on giving shoppers a chance to have a good time and shop without a price tag. The following year, Kohl's tried to use social media and their online presence to get more customers to buy things from the store. They have also made videos in an attempt to draw customers in their stores.\n\nKohl's was named \"Retailers of the Year\" in 2017 by the National Retail Federation.\n\nKohl's has grown steadily, and for many years, it was among the leaders in department stores. However, Kohl's has been struggling to stay competitive with large department stores such as J.C. Penney and Macy's. Kohl's has also been struggling to compete with online retailers such as Amazon and Walmart.\n\nTo bring in more customers and bring back customers who did not shop at Kohl's anymore, Kohl's implemented a loyalty program. Kohl's was also trying new things and investing more in technology. On 16 April 2020, Kohlâs started to temporarily close all their stores, and they were shut down for two weeks. In January 2021, Kohl's announced a $430 million investment to open new stores, and they also planned to increase the number of Kohl's stores that were located inside Walmart stores.\n\nCompany Structure\n\nOn the internal side, Kohl's has three types of stores and three different categories of retailers."

        "output": "Provide a list of the skills that may help you find the job.\n\nCrew Members in Alaska are usually more than three generations of employees. Each job has its own personality. It is expected that everyone will get along and respect everyone's job, even if they don't like the job that much.\n\nYou may be asked to join another boat or ship and you never know what is being planned for the day or the week. Your life is dictated by the captain.\n\nAlaska is a place where every day is different and every day is full of wonderful surprises. Most of the crew are happy and they work well together. There is an old saying that we all go down when the last dinghy sinks; as long as this happens there is no problem.\n\n## 7 • The TreadWater Dinghy\n\nIf you are going to the bottom line, you do not want to take your dinghy anywhere near it. And the bottom line is usually water, no matter where you work. The most serious injury on most boats today is drowning.\n\nThe number of people who drown at work has nearly doubled since 1950. In the construction industry and in the fishing industry, people are dying on land or while working on equipment, but in the maritime safety realm, two-thirds of all fatalities are the result of drowning at sea. The vast majority of these accidents happen to crewmembers of fishing boats and dredges. In some cases, people are drowning in what is known as the treadwater phenomenon. This refers to any person who ends up \"walking\" in the water, but for no apparent reason, who is not in danger of being pulled overboard. They do not have life jackets on them and the water is around their head. Their legs may look as if they are kicking, their hands may appear like they are reaching for something, but they do not know how to save themselves. And they are not getting help quickly enough. They are probably not getting help at all.\n\nThere is a simple solution to this problem, but if the captain or crewmember on duty or on watch does not know how to follow it, nothing can be done.\n\nDive-ins are very common in Alaska. They may have been the main reason your boss is trying to get you into a dinghy. This is a simple way to dive in with your gear on. This is a perfect dive to practice a proper dive-in, so you can be sure that you have made every effort to save a drowning person.\n\nA well-practiced dive-in can be the difference between life and death.\n\nThere are some boats that will not even allow you to keep your life jacket on. And there are many crewmembers who do not think that having a life jacket on is all that helpful. Some of them are not really prepared to go in for a person in distress, no matter how good they think their underwater skills are. You have one opportunity. It might not mean much to you now. If it does come down to it, you will thank yourself for all the extra effort.\n\n## 8 • You Might Be Drowning\n\nI have seen people who should have been able to make it, but they just did not get it together. One day I was talking with a friend's family. Her young son was on day eight of his survival swimming class and he was beginning to make some progress. But I warned him that when he starts to think that he can just paddle out to the boat and wait, he is in trouble. He will become very weak and not know how to swim.\n\nI talked a lot about treadwater and how the brain can only think about getting out of the water, and how you do not want to be in the water at that time. In this kind of condition, people are not usually thinking of anything else, they are not thinking about what is wrong with them, they are just thinking about getting a hand, and what they should grab with that hand. Because they just want to get out of the water. So they are going to try and get their hand into something that they think will support them, whether it is a hand or a buoy. You have to be prepared for this.\n\nThe biggest problem is not drowning. The biggest problem is the brain not processing any water so they do not recognize that they are in the water. And that is when a lot of people drown at sea. It is a lot easier in the water to see the sea than to see the boat, so once someone is able to swim and not think about getting a hand, they know it is coming. But most of the time there is not a hand. They are not expecting the current to be so strong, and so they end up paddling off. They cannot get their body to rotate to get up on the float. Their muscles are too weak to pull the body up out"

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes.\nQuestion: What is English constituency parsing?\n\n\nSparse Attention Matrix can help us achieve this without learning word embeddings.\n\nIf you remember the example in section-1 where we applied BOW. Why? Because all the words in question are in word-vec so we just need to use an empty vector as query to do lookup.\nNow come to the question, the difference is the question we have to get the \"word-embedding\" of the question instead of the query. So we can't directly use a random word-vec right? So that's why we add self attention or transformer to solve it.\n\nSo what does mean sparse attention matrix?\nAttention functions are used to find \"similarity\" between the question and possible answers. The weight which is calculated by the attention function is multiplied with the word embedding, to obtain the new word embedding.\n\nFor example consider the following input, \"A black cat\".\nInput\n\nSuppose, we want to extract all words which has the word \"cat\" within it. So, we just need to \"attend\" only on \"cat\".\nIf we do attention between question, \"A black cat\" and every word, we will have a matrix, that's called attention-matrix(A).\nWhere N = Number of words in the question.\n\nA-Transformer\nOutput\n\nLet's consider the following inputs.\nFrom the figure above we can see that \"black\" and \"cat\" are the only words which got attended in \"A black cat\". And \"black\" got attended more than \"cat\". This is because \"black\" is the head of \"cat\".\n\"A black cat\" is different from \"black cat\" because of the presence of \"A\" and \"A\" got attended more than \"black\". Now \"A\" got attended between itself.\n\nBut now we have all this answers/words/tagger-matrices. How do we combine them all?\n\nLet's consider another example.\n\nHere we have attended on three words 'black' and 'cat' and 'cat'. But all these answers/tagger have some overlap. To combine/aggregate all these attention-matrices, we can make one big attention-matrix on top of these matrices.\nNow on top of one big matrix we made from the top layer and bottom layer, which is called \"self attention\", now we can make one matrix between any two words, i.e \"black\" and \"A\" for instance. Here we can see that \"black\" and \"A\" got same weight i.e 0.466.\n\nSo let's consider 16x16 matrix A\nThis means, what we are looking for is not one or zero, but something in between 0 and 1.\nA:\n\nQuestion: What is the problem between A and A?\n\nNow let's consider \"Sparse Attention Matrix\"\nWhen we do self attention from any two words, all it does is give us a single number.\nHere, for example, we have a question \"Why is cat black?\". Here we \"attend\" between \"cat\" and \"black\", we get a 16x16 matrix, and every element in the 16x16 is 0 and a 1. But the number does not make sense. We do not want all the results to be (0, 1, 0, 1, ...). So that's why we added a sparse-Matrix. Let me show you how does this works!\n\nI will explain this to you below, but, Sparse-Matrix is applied to the 16x16 matrix A.\n\"S\" means sparse. So as opposed to dense attention, this only gets attended on those elements that are really needed. For example consider, in the question above, if we attend on \"Why\" and attend between \"why\" and \"black\", we don't get any numbers(or output) if \"Why is black a cat. Why is black an animal.\"\n\n\n\"G\" indicates that sparse attention is done \"Giant-step\". What does Giant-step means?\n\nFirst, we will start at the first column/position, \"cat\" to see if it has"

This paper is a mere description of an \"imaginary system\" with some imaginary improvements over other imaginary systems. In order to get some insight about what was done, you need to parse the abstract. But even that will not do it because what was just described was not a research method that is described in the abstract, which is why authors never describe what they actually do as an abstract. The abstract is mostly about what \"is\" and what \"could be\" instead of \"was\", if what was in question was done by others.\n\n###### What did the authors intend to do?\n\nFirst read what is described at the very beginning of the abstract and then think about the implications of what is described.\n\nWhen speech is received by an ASR module, it is converted into an utterance model for which it has been trained to recognize. Our goal is to replace traditional machine-engineered models of speech with deep neural networks that directly learn to recognize speech through end-to-end training. Collapse\n##### What problem(s) were they trying to solve?\n\nRead the very first paragraph at the beginning of the abstract.\n\nThe objective is to produce practical speech recognition technologies that can function under realistic, but challenging, conditions, such as those typical of spoken-language interaction. Collapse\n##### What success(es) did they have?\n\nThere are no success metrics described in the abstract. \n\nTo measure the effectiveness of Deep Speech, we first use its recognition results in a test set to compute error rates on multiple sets of criteria. On the Switchboard Hub5'00, the top set of widely recognized benchmarks for speech recognition, Deep Speech achieves 16.0% error (10-fold cross-validation) in speech-transcribed words, making it the best system we are aware of.\n\nWhen evaluated on a new benchmark, we demonstrate that Deep Speech handles background noise better than the top-performing commercial system. Collapse\n##### How did they know they had succeeded?\n\nDescribe the error metrics used in the text. But there is nothing that indicates that the error was made by the researchers. This is because the system was not actually tested by the authors.\n\n###### Further questions\n\n###### Anything else?\n\nYes. The abstract is nothing but a marketing document with some vague promises for the future.\n\n##### <u>Research Question:</u>\n\nRead the following question that appears after completing the abstract reading. Think about it and then, using the paper you downloaded, answer it in a short answer. You may copy/pasted some snippets from the abstract into your answer. Make sure you read the text before you answer this question. The answer may vary depending on you!\n\n###### What was the value of this study, whether in terms of what was learned or in terms of what was made.\n\nThis paper tells us, in the form of this imaginary system, what researchers have been studying for years.\n\n###### Acknowledgments and funding source(s)\n\n###### Disclaimers\n\n###### Abbreviations\n\n##### Notes\n\nI did not even bother reading the rest of the paper as those were all marketing messages describing the \"utility\" of this imaginary system. It is likely the majority of the paper is much the same since Deep Speech is likely an implementation of the algorithms mentioned in the abstract at the beginning of this paper. There is no mention of the authors actually having conducted any experiments."

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.\n\n#### 1.1.1 FewJoint\n\nFewJoint provides a new dialogue understanding dataset - FDS with 59 domains - to promote the research on FSL for dialogue understanding tasks. The dataset are constructed from the Chinese open domain speech dataset, which contains more than 30,000 speech files with a typical length more than 16min. FDS is labeled into 3 categories, \\textit{good}, \\textit{bad} and \\textit{default}. The original dataset is collected from the dialogue service platform of a top-level internet company. This large corpus has already reached a certain scale for developing speech-based ASR model and can effectively reduce the amount of data used in FSL. For each conversation, the corpus records the dialogue history and the response generated by the service platform, which can be used as the training text for training the FSL model. We annotate each conversation with labeled words and labels for the intent detection and slot filling tasks.\n\nFDS contains more than 500,000 dialogue contexts and 201,000 label distributions, which are considered as a challenging one-shot setting. Some basic statistics are shown below.\n\n\\begin{table*}[th]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Statistics of FDS Dataset}\n\\begin{tabular}{c||cccc|cc}\n\\toprule\n                 & \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{Dataset Split}                                                               & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Contexts}      \\\\ \\cline{2-7} \n                 & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{Training Dataset} & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{Dev Dataset} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\#Dialogue} \\\\ \\cline{2-7} \n                 & \\#Domains      & \\#Contexts     & \\#Domains      & \\#Contexts     & \\#Dialogue    & \\#Label \\\\ \\hline\nFDS            & 59            & 500,000        & 59            & 500,000        & 683,777       & 3,939,037  \\\\\nFDS-1shot     & 51            & 1,000         & 51            & 1,000         & 1,000         & 10,000      \\\\\nFDS-2shot     & 51            & 2,000         & 51            & 2,000         & 1,000         & 20,000      \\\\\nFDS-3shot     & 51            & 3,000         & 51            & 3,000         & 1,000         & 30,000      \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\nBesides, we also provide the test set with 1,000 unseen dialogue contexts for each domain.\n"

This scenario can be a way to end the comics, or you could have all three characters work together once their friendship is rekindled.\nGet together with some good friends and write original plays and musicals based on fairy tales. You might not be as creative as Shakespeare, but the point is to write something fun that people enjoy. You can write one of the parts, or you can help out on direction for someone's play! Maybe you want to be in charge of the costumes, the set, or the props. The way you'll learn the most and have fun is by being involved. Also, be creative and see how many you can write. Don't be afraid to mix up the fairy tales, too.\nDraw a new map of the world using only objects found in your home, such as a glass of ice cubes, a ruler, a pair of scissors, and a red pen.\nDesign a unique card game that has only one winner. The objective of this game must be to get cards in a specific order from the deck. For example, on the first turn, a certain player gets a certain number of cards, then the next person gets a certain number of cards, and so on. Maybe every player wants to get to the final prize card on their turn. To win, each player must get the cards in a specific sequence. So, the first player's turn must look something like this: Get 5 cards from the deck on this turn, and then end your turn. Now let the next player turn. She must do the same: Get five cards from the deck on her turn.\nPlan an eco-friendly vacation. Start with an eco-friendly vacation trip to somewhere like Hawaii. Then, write at least ten questions about the vacation and research your answers. For example, you might want to know: What is the best way for vacationers to reduce their carbon footprint during a trip to Hawaii? You must answer the questions (in full sentences) by the end of the year. At the end of the year, you will have the answers to these questions, and that way you have taken a trip to Hawaii and know all about it. Cool!\nDesign a computer game that's more about helping and learning than it is about destroying anything and everything. The game should feature several levels, puzzles, and something special the player can do at the end.\nCreate one hundred words that match two different categories in order to win a prize. For example, words that start with \"t\" could fit five different categories, such as \"tomb,\" \"truck,\" \"trek,\" \"turtle,\" and \"turtle.\"\nFind a story that can be transformed into a movie script, and add one of your favorite actors' names to the end. For example, you might like \"Hercules\" so you choose an actor who looks like him, such as The Rock. This gives you a movie script and can change into a movie script. You might want another script that you could turn into a movie storyboard, too. Either way works, but you need to have fun doing it.\nCreate your own alphabet of animal drawings, and"

A *K-tableau* for X* is a sequence of elements of X consisting of nonempty consecutive subsets of X.\n\nLet X be a group, B be a nonempty set called the *basis*, E be a set called the *edge set*, A be a subset of E called the *anomaly set*, and α ∈ X* be a tuple of elements of X called an *error sequence*.

Let t be the minimal integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 4t + 2 and let B be the *2t × 2t-square* consisting of the first 2t rows and columns of the matrix\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & & 1 \\\\\n& 1 & & \\\\\n&& \\ddots & & \\\\\n& & & 1 & 1 \\\\\n& 1 & & & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n\nLet K be the *K-tableau* which consists of the following subset of B\n\n* The elements corresponding to all the base change sequences in α\n\n* The elements of {1,3,5,7,9} corresponding to the *edge*\n\n* The elements of B corresponding to the edge sequences of α\n\n* The elements corresponding to the error sequences of α\n\nThen 2t columns from B and K together form a basis for the free module which is K[B]. \n\n\n## Proof\n\nThis is essentially a standard example illustrating the relationship between K-tableaux and bases. (For an introduction to K-tableaux, see the discussion in Chapter 3 of Hironaka's book.)\n\nThe first step is to show that K and B together give a basis for the group K[B]. To do this, we first need to find a way of writing a general element of the group K[B] in terms of a group element K and a vector x ∈ B. \n\nWe can represent a group element in the following way:\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & \\beta \\\\\n\\gamma & \\delta\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThen K ∈ K[B] becomes\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix} + a\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\ \n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\n(What we do here is to write down the element in a very specific way, leaving us a lot of room to work with. For example, the element will just use the first 2t columns. This will allow us to rewrite our error sequence in a way that involves only one error from the error sequence.)\n\nWe can then represent any element of this subgroup K[B] in terms of the group element K and the vector x ∈ B as\n\n$$x + a y = a 0 = 0.$$\n\nBecause we are considering a subgroup to be all the group elements which can be represented by the form \n\n$$x + a"

        "output": "Create a list of subtopics for the given topic.\n\nMusic theory and composition\n\nMelody\nA melody usually consists of a combination of notes and is most often described as a sequence of chord tones performed in a particular sequence or pattern. Melody may be written using a music staff (i.e. an abc notation). The melody is notated directly above the staff. Chords (chord forms) are written in the same key as the melody using an appropriate chord symbol. The notes are arranged into scales and keys for composition and are the basis for composing a song. Since in music each key sounds different from all others, a key is assigned to each piece of music. A key is determined by the most prevalent chord form at the start of the piece of music.\n\nIn a phrase the melody will change at intervals but always return to the same key. The melody can be any rhythmic pattern. For example, a \"familiarly repetitive\" or a \"dizzying array of short notes\" can be a melody. The notes are divided into melodic groups which may be of equal length.\n\nRhythm and tempo\nThe tempo is the speed of a piece based on the length of each musical beat or note.  Rhythm refers to the length and placement of each successive note, or more generally, the musical patterns of repeated notes, rests, or non-diatonic harmonic intervals. A piece of music with a repeated refrain can be called a \"rhymed song\". Rhythm also has an effect on the tone produced by vocalists or other instruments. It is used to create musical phrases and patterns. As different languages have different rhythmic values it is often difficult to understand the rhythm of a piece of music without prior study of the language, so sometimes it is necessary to give a separate explanation of each phrase and the overall rhythm to understand the piece of music.\n\nMelodic line\nNote values\nLength of a note\n\nMelody and harmony\nMelody is often composed with a harmony in the background, and will then either support it or oppose it. Many songs have a theme with two parts. Other variations include a first part that is usually repeated, then a second part that plays a contrasting melody, sometimes called a variation. Many songs will have only one part, and it is common that one melody is used in two parts without changing anything.\n\nSee also\n List of composition techniques\n List of forms in classical music\n List of styles in classical music\n Rhythm and meter (music)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n  Music theory is introduced in this book.

        "output": "Summarize the movie in a snarky way. Try to explain the movie in just one sentence.\n\nThe Shining is a suspenseful horror film. It involves a very unstable family as they spend a winter up in a remote mountain lodge, and the father, Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson), slowly goes crazy within this time. As strange activity comes to his family, including creepy children, weird noises, and an evil presence that haunts the entire lodge, the family tries to find help from the hotel manager, Tony, but his help isn't really helpful. But no one really knows what's going on, and things keep getting worse and worse, especially when Jack is completely off his rocker. His family (his wife Wendy played by Shelley Duvall, and his young son Dickie played by Danny Lloyd) try to figure out what to do, and decide that, in the end, they must leave Jack behind in the lodge. That doesn't necessarily end it. Jack is not a man you want to leave in a dark, dingy house with an evil presence. After the credits, Jack, who is still going slowly crazy, returns to the family back in the real world. Of the two options—he stays in the lodge with the kids and takes care of them, or he destroys them to keep them with him, Jack chooses destruction and chaos, eventually murdering his family. A great film, and it's now a horror classic. It was also Kubrick's last film.\n\nWhat was the most interesting concept you uncovered in your research?\n\nA lot of people ask me why Shelley Duvall's character is so annoying and has no redeeming qualities. I found out it wasn't in the book. Part of Kubrick's genius is his ability to subvert the original work and not just to go with it but to change things that could make the movie better and create a more original movie. Kubrick's story was so amazing, and it seems a little crazy that he couldn't write that well. The only thing he wrote was a short story, which was later made into a movie called \"Kroton's Face.\" Kubrick just didn't write. When The Shining came out, it was a bit like the movie of The Cat in the Hat when it came to sales. He wrote the movie with a really interesting cast, and they brought it to life. I think Nicholson is the most popular character, so in a way, everyone focuses on him. His psychosis, his anger, and his craziness is like candy for the eyes, so that's why he's the most well-known character. But I think Danny is the one who has the craziest story, or at least is the craziest in the end.\n\nWhat film, or moment in film, would you most want to live via the memories of?\n\nI would love to have the memories of my life by watching movies. I would love to learn a bit more about myself. Just through watching myself on camera, I can start analyzing myself a bit more and see where I've been. Also, there's no pain or grief experienced through watching yourself on screen. You only feel the positives, like I do now, living through the story of the creation of this book, or the memories of the stories told to me by those who participated in this movie. I would want to live by watching movies. I would love to have that opportunity to see myself on camera and analyze myself on such a personal level. It would be fascinating to see all of my friends. It's like a photo album.\n\nWhat did you learn from Jack Nicholson's madness?\n\nIn general, I think this generation spends too much time on social media. The internet and social media aren't inherently any bad, but we spend way too much time on them. People get addicted to it, and they become very unbalanced. They can actually spend the rest of their lives on these media outlets. It may actually change our way of thinking. We now need to be on them all the time, and we get to know everyone who is on that website. I think we need to take it down and to enjoy nature and the outdoors. We would have a more healthy life if we weren't connected to phones or the internet. We all have smartphones now, so we aren't able to see what's going on around us. It seems like we have no time to waste, and we need to be on our phones. We need to get back to real life.\n\nHow much time did you get to spend with Jack Nicholson?\n\nJack was one of my favorite actors, so I felt honored to even be able to spend time with him. I talked to him about what it was like doing this movie, and some other things he had been up to. It was really great to"

They might want to create beautiful print ads, develop the website, own the domain, and maintain an online store. All of it.\n\nFor many things to get done, however, there is a tradeoff between cost and quality. While it is possible to find an affordable website developer and have a competent SEO expert, the problem is that many things can go wrong, and these people aren't that great about troubleshooting those issues. For example, it is not uncommon for a brand to be penalized by its search engine because its website was taken down due to some glitch with its web host. Once a site is down, it can take a lot of work to get things back on track, even if it's only one thing.\n\nA smarter route is to do one thing, but to do it so well that you can win through it, especially if it's something that happens for everyone.\n\nTo solve the issue, I created The String Thing. It is a t-shirt with a printed design on it using only 20 to 25 characters with no spaces. To make sure it's done right, I went through a long process of testing designs and quality. I used a special font called Futura, which has a small number of characters to work with. I asked my friends about every aspect of the project. I got feedback on almost everything. I made lots of changes, and then changed some more. I tested my product in a way that made my t-shirt even better than my competitors.\n\nI sold all 30 T-Shirts on the first day. From then on, I kept the price high and sold out every day. The first T-Shirt I made cost me about $420 because of the cost of printing. The shirts I sold after that ranged between $390 and $450, but I gave out shirts free of charge to bloggers that reviewed my brand. One of these bloggers said, \"I was skeptical about The String Thing at first, but now I can't live without it.\"\n\nHere is how it worked.\n\nIf someone wanted to make a custom T-Shirt to commemorate their wedding, for example, my product page would allow them to choose the type of material, their size, the color, the type of shirt collar (\"standard,\" \"sport,\" \"vintage,\" etc.) and the number of characters for the logo. They would then have the option to add the characters (no spaces, 20 characters maximum including numerals and space) for the logo on the shirt itself. Their total t-shirt cost would be based on the price of the materials, the size, and the number of characters used on the shirt.\n\nOnce a T-Shirt was sold and delivered, it was ready for printing. The printing cost was more than $400. I was also paying for the shipping and insurance, and the site was not charging my customers. The T-Shirt was going to be expensive and high-quality. I wasn't getting into this for money, but to get my message out.\n\nI advertised like it was a normal discount. It is interesting because I didn't want to put an extreme discount on it. I wanted it to be priced so that the T-Shirt would not seem too expensive and then when I sold it, people would say, \"How come this is so cheap?\" instead of thinking, \"This is a really expensive shirt.\" The main thing was to not do it for cheap, so my target customers were looking for quality.\n\nHowever, the brand's product page made it look like everything was at a discount, even the 25 characters for $4.20 or the \"design yours\" model where you could choose your own images for $4.90. I was selling a $42 printed T-Shirt for $4.20 and saying that it was going to cost almost as much.\n\nIn order to put it on display, I gave it away for free for a day. This was"

        "output": "List some of the top real estate marketing words to add value to the listing and engage more potential buyers.\nTop Real Estate Marketing Words\nAs you know, words do not have a direct correlation with selling and buying, for example. What they do mean is they create emotion, which may or may not mean they are attractive and a benefit for either the seller or buyer.\nLet’s put it this way: Your goal is to sell your home and your goal is for my home to sell; but, can you agree that we both want to spend less on our home for the most bang for the buck?\nAnd if the answer is yes, we can agree that we want the best seller to get the best rate and as an agent, to make the best profit.\nNow, let’s look at this article and use it as motivation to help you develop marketing strategies that may appeal to today’s buyer.\nTo find your dream home with more confidence and ease, take the extra time and make sure you know these 36 top real estate marketing words, as you will see their words mean so much more than sales are made on the internet, or real-life selling.\nWhy You Need to Know These Real Estate Marketing Terms\nWe’ve already determined the words do not have an immediate correlation to selling or buying, but one would agree they do have an affect. And, although no one likes to talk about the emotional part of selling or buying a home, the words do create emotion. And you could agree (or could disagree) that these emotions can create an effect. And as an agent, you want to use these words to create the best offer and the best deal.\nSo, what do you think? Is this an article on “words” or an article on “real estate marketing?”\nYou decide.\n36 Top Real Estate Marketing Words\nSo, are you ready to find your home?!\nLet’s start the list with the Top 15 real estate marketing words first, and then we’ll see how each word relates to marketing.\n1) Luxurious\nAs an agent, how often are you able to get a listing with the word “luxurious” attached? Well, here it is.\nLuxurious is the top word (you know a top seller of any article).\nBut what does luxurious mean? And what does it mean to a seller? Well, to begin with, luxury indicates something of high quality, and when a seller looks at their 2-bedroom, 2-bathhouse, they wonder, do I have anything really special? And now, when you say the home was “Luxurious,” the seller realizes that he or she has an “upper-class” home.\nBut more so, luxury often has to do with value. In this case, the luxury of a “luxurious lifestyle.”\nAs you can imagine, luxury is a very top of mind real estate marketing word, and if you need a “luxurious” home to be listed, you may ask yourself, what am I really trying to create?\n2) Custom\nAs you learn about many of the top real estate marketing words, you find some have two meanings.\nThere is the real estate marketing meaning, and then the seller’s meaning.\nOne such example of two meanings is the “luxurious” meaning and the “custom” meaning.\nAs a house seller and buyer, you want a home to reflect a custom luxury look-and-feel. But, also, you can agree, it is just not possible to have a custom luxury home for the low-ball price that every house has had for years and years.\nYou can agree now that the luxury of a custom house can be over $300,000.\nAs a “luxury” (in this case the top seller in terms of the word), when you describe your house as “luxury” you can also say it is “custom.” And then you would have two meanings and two results.\nThink of it this way: You can create the luxury look of any house and increase the value by over $100,000, or you are a bargain hunter and say there is a $50,000 difference.\n3) Top-Quality\nYou will also find some of these best-seller words can mean two (or more) things. But, one thing we can agree on when we say the word in this list is “Top-Quality.”\nFor example: You could say you have a high-quality home with or without the word. If you are high-end, you can say you have a high-end home. But you can also say you have a “top-quality” home with no mention or attachment to upper-class.\nBut when you say you have a top-quality home, you would be saying your home is well put together. And, you"

        "output": "Create a template in markdown to create scope for Jira tickets. Members should use this template as a checklist to ensure they have included all the necessary information when creating a ticket.\nThe template is available here. It may look like a long document, but it uses the Markdown \"fenced code\" syntax, which lets us use inline code while using Markdown.\nThe code block below has a couple of pre defined variables defined for use inside the template.\nThese should all be included in every ticket. See the wiki page for more information about these variables.\nTo ensure everyone is on the same page when creating tickets, we should make sure that each ticket is unique and contains only relevant information.\nTo do this, any tickets that are more than three messages old and are still open should be closed. Any tickets that were closed more than three messages old should also be reopened so all members are back on the same page.\nYou can see the list of tickets here.\nJira tickets must not be closed.\nJira tickets must have a clear title.\nJira tickets must not be empty - at minimum they should include a description and assignee.\nOnly one ticket per issue is allowed.\nA \"duplicate\" is a ticket where the content is exactly the same, and it is not clear why it has been created. A ticket that is duplicate of it's existing parent cannot be created. If you find another ticket that is a duplicate of your existing ticket, and the existing ticket is not an issue, you should either close that ticket and merge it into your existing ticket or else close it and notify the appropriate person to merge it. If that ticket has a bug assigned to it then you should create a comment to the original person responsible for the issue explaining why you are closing it.\nA ticket should not be closed without a comment on why - this should be the same if you are closing it, merging it or commenting on it.\nOnly members who have the responsibility/accountability flag should close tickets.\nA ticket can and should be reopened on request - if it has been closed, a ticket can be reopened regardless of who has closed it. However, please ensure that one person owns the ticket and has the responsibility/accountability flag and that they are also listed as one of the assignees - otherwise it may be very difficult to resolve the issue.\nFor people that have the accountability flag, they should be given warning if tickets are being closed without explanation.\nAny tickets which are a duplicate of other tickets should be closed in one of two ways - the old one should be closed and marked as a duplicate or merged into the original, or the new one should be closed and the original should be commented on along with a link back to the duplicate.\nA note added to a ticket should always have a timestamp and be a comment - not made from a reply action.\nWe should make sure a single ticket exists for each issue, but more than one ticket can be defined as a \"version\" of the issue.\nWe should use the ticket system for discussion on issues, rather than having personal slack groups.\nTickets must be closed if the issue is resolved - these are then archived. Please consider archiving tickets that are not being actively discussed or closed for 3 months even if they have not been resolved as this will free up space on the ticket system.\nTicket numbers are important - ensure that old numbers are still used in older tickets.\nTickets should not be marked as resolved. Once resolved, old tickets should be deleted.\nAny ticket where there is an issue and no resolution should be added to the \"Open issues list\"\nWhen tickets were started, each member who was on the project and has the 'responsible/accountability' flag was asked to add themselves as a primary assignee. Since then, the membership has changed. Therefore, make sure you add yourself as an assignee, either 'primary' or 'secondary' if you can assign yourself there.\nThe \"responsible/accountability\" and \"primary assignee\" flags should be held by the appropriate project leads.\nThe name of the primary assignee should appear on all tickets as a link that automatically takes you to their ticket.\nPlease do not leave yourself as a primary assignee in all tickets if you are not involved, unless there is no one else available.\nWhere someone is only listed as secondary assignee, if they are still in the project or team, they may also be asked to take primary status for any ticket.\nIf you find someone who is a primary assignee without being on the project, please add them to the project.\nWe should add people who are in the team to the project - if you added yourself but somebody else got in first, don't be sad about it.\nWhen someone has worked on the ticket you were assigned to, it's a nice gesture (from you) to update the ticket and include"

        "output": "A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. Write a user story for a given software.\n\nGmail\n\nGmail was a product that was released to the public in 2004. The purpose of this web application was as an e-mail interface that allowed users to have more email than they could send with any other company. The business model, or how Gmail made money, was their ads, which were displayed right next to the users' messages and which were of great interest to the e-mail users. At present, the use of Gmail has dropped significantly in terms of users from 2015 to 2019 and this is a major problem for Google itself because they need to find ways to get this app back into the field.\n\nThis product is of interest to the end user because they're getting all of their e-mails in one place, rather than needing to go through a series of different apps to do the same thing. Gmail also has the ability to keep other types of information such as videos and photos separate, rather than having to go through a separate app to get this information, which can be time-consuming and frustrating for many individuals who wish to do more things quickly.\n\nThis product is also good for customers because it's easy to use, has great customer support, and is very reliable.\n\nThe customer who is using this product is not using it because it's free, or because it's the best product on the market; it's because they need to have their emails stored somewhere.\n\nYou would have to do something specific about this product to make it better, but let's say you have 10 seconds to think about it. You may want to improve the way that emails are saved so they never expire, or make it easier for people to sign in and out at Google. It's really up to your imagination!\n\nThe purpose of writing a user story is to allow the software developers to come up with a concept for making a product or app better.\n\nI have written stories of this sort of nature. A good user story allows the software developers to see what is important to the customers. They see this story as a guideline, rather than a written contract.\n\nI came up with this story:\n\nAs an e-mail user, I want to be able to view and send emails to other users in Gmail. But as an e-mail user, I need to be able to see all of my emails so that I can see which ones have been sent and which ones will be received.\n\nThis is an important question and I'll answer it here. We are trying to see what is the most important task or task that we can do with our software.\n\nThis means that the first thing we need to do is write a user story that describes how our software works.\n\nUser stories are written according to what the user is thinking, and if it is possible to provide it for them. They are supposed to be written in terms of an end user, rather than in terms of the developer, which means that the user shouldn't have to make any decisions about what she wants to do in terms of the software, if it's in terms of what she wants or needs.\n\nA user story can be written in terms of what the user is thinking or in terms of what she would like done with the software.\n\nIt can be written in terms of what we would like done with the user, and in the case of this product, we have the user story below.\n\nUser Story 1: The user will be able to send emails to anyone from anywhere in their email account.\n\nUser Story 2: We will be able to save our contacts list as they come into the account.\n\nUser Story 3: We will be able to see all of our emails, and we can see who has sent us an email and when the emails were sent.\n\nAll that I can say about user stories is that we can write them in any way that we like.\n\nAs a software developer, you can write them as we have done with this one.\n\nIf you were to write one that was more formal and detailed and which was more technical, there would probably be many things that you could add to the story that would make it more interesting.\n\nThis one user story that I have written is called a user story because it's about a user.\n\nAs a user, the user story describes the behavior of a user.\n\nThe user story says that if you want to send an email, you will be able to send emails to anyone from anywhere in your Gmail account.\n\nA user story can also include things that have to do with the software.\n\nThis means that you can include things such as what is most likely"

        "output": "Make a list of the pros and cons of the given decision.\n\nImplementing a Remote Working Policy\n------------------------------------\n\nA few years ago, you were hired to work for a small start-up in an upstate\ncity called New Paltz. The company was very small with\nonly a handful of employees, but it had an excellent reputation in the\nindustry. You were hired as the project manager for a new game the\ncompany was producing. There were four employees that were directly\nworking on the project, with your boss responsible for other games\nthe company was producing. There were also six contract employees working\nin New Paltz and three people who were working from home. Your company\nsaw a huge success for the game and asked you and your boss to move to\nNYC to manage the project. We will assume that at least 2,000,000 people\nhave now purchased the game. There are now 34 employees across the US\nwho work for the company, and with the success of the game, a new\nproject manager is needed for the current project.\n\nYou and your boss are now both in NYC, and you are both struggling to\nwork with people that are not in the office because you are so close to\neach other. This is really not conducive to the workflow you are used\nto. Your boss has suggested that people who work remotely need to\nbring their work to the office and work during the week. He is\nconcerned that you may be at a disadvantage using remote workers when\ntrying to solve problems that can only be solved by people in the same\noffice because people that are able to work remotely come from different\nlife experiences and might not have the same perspective as someone who\ngrows up and lives in the same area. He has even asked your boss to send\nout an email with a proposed solution to this problem, but he does not\nhave the full bandwidth necessary to create a proposal or to answer all\nthe questions that you and your bosses need to address in order to\nimplement a new remote working policy. 1\n\n.. [1]\n   - You do not need to have an answer to this question, but there must be\n     some sort of description of why you are thinking the way you are and\n     why you need to present this work.\n\nAfter some discussion about the logistics of the problem, your boss\nconcluded that since you and your coworkers had been able to manage the\nproject to this stage successfully, that the process you started\nalready meets the expectations, even if you are now in need of a\npolicy.\n\nYou recently have two weeks off where you are not working, and you would\nlike this extra time to think about how this process could be improved\nover the next two months when you will need to manage three new people\nworking remotely. If you succeed, your boss will suggest that you\nwork remotely for more than two months. There is also a possibility\nthat your boss could give you a full-time position and make you live in\nNew York if you are able to produce a good result. You are a young\nmarried man and you do not have a mortgage or rent to pay, but your parents\ncurrently lend you $1200 a month, and your wife is also helping make you\nbuy a one-bedroom condo that you had found through a local real estate\nagent. You have $300,000 in your savings account, which you are using\nfor emergencies. You and your wife have both had your salaries frozen\nfor the next month, but you have been able to save $8,000 this year.\nThe last time your parents had made a loan for you, you returned to them\n$5000 because you just had not been able to get yourself on track to\nrepaying them.\n\nYou feel strongly that you do not want to live in New York. You did not\nstudy at Syracuse University. You know about the different neighborhoods\nin the city, and you feel that NYC might not be as expensive as other\nplaces you have experienced, you have heard people say that you can do\nfifteen subway rides for $200 a month, but you know nothing about the\ncommute so you have no evidence to back this statement up. You have\nheard your friends from college talk about how they are going to New\nYork because it is a big city and a lot of opportunities are available.\nYou have also heard them talk about how it is a lot more expensive to\nmove to New York than it is to move to Philadelphia, so you have no\nidea if NYC is any closer to what you can afford to pay each month.\n\nYour first reaction is to try to decide if you would like to work in\nNYC"

The business cannot\ndiscriminate himself, and he trusts the person. As a result,\nthe businessman loses his money.\n\n\n# 1.4.  Punctuation\n\nAs mentioned previously, one of the main differences\nbetween English-language and LaTeX is the way to\nuse punctuation. In LaTeX, you usually use a special character to\nmark punctuation, such as parentheses and square brackets.\n\n## 1.4.1.  Brackets\n\nBrackets are used to define a word phrase where the meaning\nis not completely clear from the general grammar rules.\n\nYou can use braces for that:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=latex]\n\\[\n  \\begin{array}{cc}\n    a & b \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n\\]\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\nAs you can see, you have to start and end brackets with the\nspecial character `\\[`. And only the beginning of the\nbrackets must be surrounded with something else (typically\nnewlines).\n\nIf you have to add text in brackets, you can do it like this:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=latex]\n\\[ I am adding text. \\]\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\n\n## 1.4.2. Curly braces\n\nCurly braces are used to mark a set of rules or a list.\n\nIf we wish to describe a list of items, we can use them like:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=latex]\n\\textbf {This is a list of items}.\n\nThe items are (they are separated by commas):\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item item 1\n    \\item item 2\n    \\item item 3\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\nYou can also use curly braces to indicate a set of statements. If\nit’s the case, we sometimes use words like “if\", “or\", “for\", and etc.\n\n\n## 1.4.3. Double Quotes\n\nIn LaTeX, you can use double quoted text to mark text that\nrepresents an exact value.\n\nIf we have a list of numbers, we can use double quotes like this:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=latex]\nWe have these numbers:\n1, 2, 5, 9, -37, 17, 700 \\\\\nWhat is the sum of these numbers?\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\nHere we have a set of numbers, and LaTeX understands it as an unordered collection.\nAs you can see, we write the numbers one by one.\nNow, if you need to say that the sum of these numbers is a number,\nyou can add a \\verb|\\hfill| to the end of the list. That is\nsometimes called a \\textbf{hanging indent}.\n\n\n## 1.4.4. Single Quotes\n\nHere we use single quoted text to mark text that has a special meaning\nwithin a certain macro, which we will touch on in the future.\n\n\n## 1.4.5. Text with Symbols\n\nSometimes you wish to add the mathematical symbol to your text:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=latex]\nThis is a text with symbols:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\sqrt{x^2}=x|\n\\end{equation}\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\nAs you see, \\verb|\\{| is called \\textbf{aligning bracket}. You should\nnot try to use it as a quotation mark, or as a set of rules indicator.\n\n\n## 1.4.6. Alignment\n\nSome items in the list might have to be aligned:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=latex]\nHere should be an aligned list:\n\\begin{align}\nf(x) = & x^2 \\\\\n& x = 2\n\\end{align}\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\nFor example, you can make align a list of expressions:\n\n\\"

The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game. At the end of the game, players can choose from one of three endings based on the actions they take throughout the play time.\n\n```\n============\nEAS33092    \n3/28/2018   \nKratos and his son are on a quest for a magical orb in order to save his son’s life. Enemies that Kratos battles are human like (centaurs, trolls) and fantastical creatures (dragons.)\n\nThe story is a fantasy, which means that the game is not realistic as a whole, with all the creatures that you do battle with.\n\nIt is an action game, which means that it consists of a lot of fast action. From what I have read, this game is the most demanding one PlayStation 4 has ever developed.\n\nThe story is simple and can be understood quickly. There really is not much to the story. It is mostly about getting to the end and finishing it as quick as possible.\n\nThe main character, Kratos, is known as the Greek god of war. It is said he had been defeated by Zeus, and then had his daughter (Athena) murder in the temple of Zeus. The game shows a flashback of Kratos murdering the rest of his family, which consists of his wife and son.\n\nKratos’s son has been turned into a baby for 100 years due to being the one who had destroyed Zeus. Now he is old enough and powerful to kill him.\n\nKratos needs to stop Zeus and his companions in order to save his son, as he is the only one who could defeat Zeus. Since Kratos killed Zeus earlier in the game, he also has to find the remaining gods to defeat Zeus and save his son.\n\nThe game has three different endings. One has a happy ending where Kratos and his son are reunited. Another ending leaves you wondering what happens next, as you did not know what is right and wrong in the last storyline.\n\nThe story is so fast paced that your concentration is easily sucked into the game. The graphics are outstanding with little or no slow down.\n\nFrightening scenes: The scene in which the monsters of the world are destroying everything. Kratos and his son battling the monsters and then finally being victorious.\n\nThe violence in this game is so intense that when it is over you will think that you have died. The last portion of the game will give you such a shock that you will wonder why you ever started playing this game in the first place.\n\nThere are lots of weapons that you can use and each one is deadly. It is very easy to find the ones that you need as you progress through the game. You are able to choose which weapon you want to use.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, there are times when you will find yourself in a dark and scary place. It is so scary and intense that you will want to stop the game and turn off the TV. As you get down to business and finally defeat the enemies, the fear and anxiety fade away into excitement and accomplishment.\n\nThis game is not for the weak-hearted; it takes a strong emotional toll. The violence in the game is intense. You have to fight the monsters and demons that try to kill you, and the ending is so horrible that you will have nightmares for years.\n\nI rate this one an 11/10.\n\n(2)\t\n\n(3)\t\n\n(4)\t\n\n(5)\t\n\n(6)\t\n\n(7)\t\n\n(8)\t\n\n(9)\t\n\n(10)\t\n\n(Overall rating = 9.0/10)\n```"

The first one is on how to build your own security awareness testing program. There may be other things that you will want to include in your program that are not mentioned in this appendix. It is up to you to decide what will best suit your needs.\n\nAt the end of this chapter are the questions used to test the knowledge, skills, and abilities that you should have when your security awareness testing program is completed. If you have already completed a program and you have the correct answers, you will be able to see how well you did the first time you answered the questions. If you have not completed your test yet, you should go back to the beginning of the chapter again and study it as you would any other lesson that we have learned about.\n\n## Appendix 1\n\nWe have started this book with three lessons which will help you define and understand the problem. These lessons have covered the importance of security awareness, why we must have an organized program, and how we can test our program. In this appendix, we want to define the other lesson we have learned about. We want to help you better recognize the characteristics of being a good security professional.\n\nThis is a list of some of the characteristics that should be present in an employee who has received security training. It is not an all-encompassing list; there is not enough space to cover the full characteristics of a good security professional. The list that we have just shown you is, however, a good list of starting points that a company can use to gauge if its employees are as competent as required.\n\n## An Overview of Characteristics\n\n  1. Does the employee read the messages sent to the email account regularly?\n\n  2. When an employee's name appears on a message that requires an action to be taken, is the employee able to identify it and deal with it correctly?\n\n  3. Does the employee read training notices regularly?\n\n  4. Does the employee take the trouble to make sure that each piece of training is understood and that the employee's understanding can be recorded?\n\n  5. How does the employee react when a document is given to them that requires action?\n\n  6. How does the employee react when the document that they are working on needs to be reviewed?\n\n  7. How does the employee react when they become aware that they have received an email from an unknown address?\n\n  8. How does the employee react when they receive an internal memo that requires them to take an action?\n\n  9. Is the employee able to identify which computer needs protection, and how do they protect it?\n\n  10. Does the employee have a good understanding of security policies and procedures?\n\n  11. When the employee is in charge of a project, does their team work to a schedule or do they take their time to do it all?\n\n  12. Can the employee identify when someone has a problem in their work, rather than waiting until it is obvious?\n\n  13. Is the employee able to work with anyone of whatever color?\n\n  14. Is the employee able to work with anyone regardless of religious beliefs or cultural differences?\n\n  15. Is the employee able to take part in a group exercise without letting their individuality interfere with the group's performance?\n\n  16. Does the employee feel comfortable communicating with the members of their project?\n\n  17. Can they take a positive view about their work?\n\n## Appendix 2\n\nAs with many things, security training is a skill that must be learned,"

When I was in my youth, I had a small press. I had about half a dozen members who would join together and do the layout and typesetting, and each one would get one book (usually between 50 and 100) and that was it. I'll never forget it. I would print and publish between one and two books a week. Our books cost five dollars each and we sold them by the box. We all used to say that we didn't want our books to be bought; we just wanted to be known for our art. That was our dream. Now, instead of doing that, it's like a pyramid: there are big publishers and small independent press publishers in between and then there are artists or small presses. That has taken away the joy and the excitement. We lost all that energy when our press was taken over by other people. Those were more like friends of mine than just a business. I have a lot of friends because I put them into my company because they were nice people, and they could help. There was a lot of art behind that. Now, with so many more people involved, I don't feel the same feelings about it anymore. And so it's difficult. This is all very strange. Now they want me to work with them as a partner of sorts but it is all too much, and I just want to keep on going the way I've been going and let them do what they want to do._\n\n_I'm interested in what might cause a change in anyone having an interest in the art? In people's lives, in society? In the world? In their creativity? I can't see any other reason than the influence of technology today. There used to be this kind of magic with the old printing processes and now technology is everywhere. Now it is all so impersonal. There is no soul to it because it is so impersonal. There is no creativity. It all takes place automatically but you don't feel connected to it. I think it all started with video, which was also a new invention. Video brought in the computer, which made so much sense for me. There is this machine, which records and can be edited or manipulated in a certain way. You didn't have to do it by hand. I could just type it into the machine and I would get the book. But that doesn't mean that anything creative was taking place. It did not have a soul nor did it have a human touch._\n\nNow you know the basics of book publishing. Your next step is to choose a theme for your book and write it. Then you'll complete some of the most fundamental tasks, from editing and designing your cover to producing your first run of books and selling it as well. This is a long lesson, so we'll go through it in four lessons. In Lesson 33, we'll review what's involved in getting your book published. After that is Lesson 34, which will show you how to create the cover for your book once you've written it. In Lesson 35, you will learn how to design the inside of your book. And, finally, in Lesson 36, you'll learn how to produce and sell your book.\n\nIn the process, you'll create work from your imagination, work that you can be proud of, because it represents the fruit of your own creative efforts. We'll see how the technologies can be used to work on your book in ways that really bring out your individual vision.\n\nIf you want to be taken seriously as a writer, it is important that you have more than just a manuscript. A good way to start is to create an actual book with all the elements in place: a cover, a theme, an introduction. You might also want your friends to sign their names to the book with a few lines of their own (called an \"inscription\"). Remember, when you create a book like this, people know that you take your writing seriously and that you are not just someone who spends time in a dark room writing down gibberish. You are an actual author ready to take on"

Even her fellow republican have had a few words for her.\n\n**22/02/2021 17:26**\n\n<NAME>., <NAME>.\n\nIt all started in the 80s... when <NAME> made this song - no matter how many times you watch it, you can't but be a bit impressed by what it represents at that same time, when the woman was just a child, and what it represents nowadays, as it was one of the most famous and recognizable songs of that time.\n\nThis one is in the 70s and in an oscar-nominated movie. This song is just magic.\n\n### How to start a conversation with a woman\n\nThe conversation could flow the following way:\n\nSo, you’ve asked her. Now what?\n\nIt can be a difficult moment. She’ll probably be thinking the same about asking you. So she’ll be looking at you to see if you’re nervous or if have no clue what to say. If you have any nervousness on your face then you’re screwed – at least, for now. You’ll probably lose her.\n\nYou might feel like you need to have something planned out for your reply, but you don’t. You’re just trying to make a conversation. You don’t need to read some kind of guide or use a certain technique.\n\nMostly it will just be about taking things at a natural rate. If she’s willing to talk to you, then she’s willing to give you time to gather your thoughts.\n\nShe’ll wait until you think of something that could be a good introduction. And even if you don’t have anything, she’ll be willing to talk to you regardless.\n\nIf this isn’t happening, and you’re starting the conversation and she’s not talking, then it might be time to try another approach.\n\nTo make conversation, you might have to start a conversation about something you both enjoy or could enjoy. For example, I was in a gym that has a small pool. It’s just the two of us there.\n\nThe conversation starts:\n\nWell, it’s really cold outside.\n\nThat’s true, it is.\n\nYou’re doing your exercise?\n\nYeah, why?\n\nThe water’s cold?\n\nIt’s a little.\n\nYou think?\n\nYes, it was probably 04 this morning when I started my workout.\n\nThat’s not good… I only get out of the water once a year.\n\n**22/02/2021 17:22**\n\nI’m not very good at making friends. Or that’s what I thought about myself for a very long time. I’m used to people having opinions about me and about me being a certain type of person. Most people I know about me, I learned about myself through my friends’ opinions. How much they’re thinking about me.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that I’m scared of people feeling bad about my character.\n\nI guess that’s what made me feel like I was different. It kind of made me feel like I was always just following the “rules”, the ways of how people act in society.\n\nI’m not sure if that’s how people act.\n\nYou want to know what I think? People who feel like they are “different” really need to know that they are not!\n\n**22/02/2021 17:24**\n\nI just don't really understand these kinds of things. I don't even have a Facebook. I don't see what the point is.\n\n**22/02/2021 17:28**\n\nI just heard this song, and, wow. There were a lot of feelings I had while listening.\n\n**22/02/2021 17:28**\n\nI've been spending a lot of time here recently, and I don't really see this as anything more than a really nice place. You can find a really nice place in your friend group, too, sometimes even more than just a lot of people who think like you.\n\nI know it can be frustrating sometimes to hear people say what they like and what they dislike. I know that feeling of being judged or judged, and it can be very frustrating if you've been talking to people about something other than your personality,"

        "output": "For a quick and efficient office workout, suggest a short routine.\nIn a recent article from The Daily, a 9 minute routine is outlined for getting the heart rate pumping, the lungs expanded, and the body feeling better overall.\nThe routine is comprised of lunges, squats, push-ups, and sit-ups.\nThe first step can also be a quick one, going into a seated position and then extending arms up to the ceiling and stretching your legs out to the ground. Hold for 30 seconds.\nA quick standing squat is then next before the next step.\nFor a lunger, first step over a chair leg without touching the chair to the ground. To the next step, turn around and step backwards and over the chair leg. Repeat several times to get each leg feeling more flexible.\nThen, step over a chair leg with a different foot.\nNext, perform a squat and put your palm on your knee and hold for 5 seconds. Lift the leg before changing sides.\nNow, perform the same movement with a towel or mat placed under your hands and your knees to avoid injury and increase the exercise.\nFinally, reach out and to the ground with hands and knees and do a sitting up into one knee at a time.\nLastly, in between these sets, do sit-ups with hands behind your head and toes and knees against the floor.\nIn a recent article from Yahoo, there was new information brought to light about the different kinds of water one should drink throughout the day in order to keep the body hydrated.\nIt has been suggested that one type of water should replace a type of beverage in the morning to drink.\nFor example, if one drinks coffee throughout the morning, have two to three glasses of water with a lemon slice or two. With each glass of water, add fresh lemon slices and strawberries into the water which gives it the perfect amount of sweet flavor. One could also add one scoop of vanilla vanilla whey and coconut oil into each glass of water.\nFor lunch and dinner, water is a great idea.\nThe reason for this has been suggested because one needs to be prepared for the increase in metabolic activity at the start of the day.\nThe new research that was brought to light claims that a better approach for hydrating during the day is to consume water throughout each meal. During lunchtime, for example, add one cup of chilled water in with food. Similarly, drink a cup of chilled water with dinner.\nSince drinking fluids before and during meals is the most beneficial way to stay hydrated, it is important to plan ahead and remember to have this beverage with every meal and snack.\nWhile all foods make you hungry, some make you hungrier than other and some will cause you to over-eat.\nAccording to Daily Health Press, 11 foods that make you hungrier will be revealed in the following article.\nA study has been conducted that has suggested that eating processed foods and sugary snacks lead to an increase in hunger pangs and an overall increase in food cravings.\nThis is due to the fact that processed foods cause an increase in ghrelin (a hormone associated with hunger). The same goes for those who eat sugary snacks.\nProcessed foods include snacks like chips, cookies, crackers, and other similar items.\nFoods that should be avoided at all cost for this reason include pastas (cooked or uncooked) that have been processed with high quantities of salt and sugar.\nAccording to CNN, the best way to avoid this is to avoid processed high sodium foods that could increase hunger pangs or lead to over-eating during the day and night.\nAs for sugary snacks, many find these to be easy and quick fixes for getting something into the body that will make one feel better after an exhausting morning.\nAccording to CNN, avoiding sugary snacks can reduce snacking because of excess sugar leading to hunger in the mid-to-late afternoon.\nSnacks should not be more than 50 calories.\nAvoid items with higher fat, higher sodium, and more calories, and stick with healthier options, such as yogurt and fruits.\nThis is a snack that is typically not made of sugar but actually made up of sugar. They are found in many places like the market, but should definitely not be part of ones snack.\nAccording to the article, most snacks with a higher fat-to-carb ratio are more satisfying that those lower in fat content and high in carbs.\nThe foods that make it easier for one to lose weight according to the Mayo clinic are those that are a healthy snack.\nThese include apples, pears, bananas, strawberries, and citrus as well as peanut butter, non-salty nuts, and unsalted nuts.\nAnother type of healthy snack are the berries or fruit. It is suggested that it be fresh, however, frozen would be okay depending on availability"

I'm not a vegetarian myself. And when we'd started making a meal with a vegetable soup, and it was very, very good, to the last drop of it... and my daughter is a vegetarian too... she's a vegetarian too. She said, \"You know what? I think this is going to be a tradition for us... I've had several vegetarian dinners, but I think this was more like a family meal.\" She said, \"You know what? You're not gonna believe this?\" We were walking, after the meal, we walked along the promenade.\n\nMy grandson, he had just turned one, his name is Noah. He came all excited because he knew it was his grandma. He said, \"Grandma, what happened is... Grandma, can I have a balloon?\" I said, \"Okay.\" I thought he was in pain, he was saying, \"Oh, balloon, balloon,\" you know?... It turned out that when they gave us this balloon, they gave us two balloons. And he looked down and he saw another balloon he wanted. He said, \"Oh, Mommy, will you give me that balloon?\"\n\nAnd she said, \"No, my little Noah, you took yours. You have one balloon.\" And he said, \"No, Mommy, I want both balloons. I want both balloons.\" And so, she gave him both balloons. He was looking at two balloons, and they got to us. He came all excited. \"Grandma, Grandma! What happened is...\" we were going to the beach. He came all excited. \"What happened is, we have two balloons now.\"\n\nI was so touched by that. By how this family takes care of each other... and she said. \"You know what I was thinking too? I was thinking, what if we can get... have more vegetarian meals. Do we have to talk to everybody? Can we just have this as a tradition? Like maybe we could have two or three times a year, like a celebration for a special event.\" And my daughter and my grandchildren... my granddaughter... was there at the table... she was just a year old. She sat there and she held a glass of water for me, and she said, \"Grandma, can I help you?\" Can I help you?\n\nSo, it was a special day... it was a very special day. It's one of my favorite places to come. I think this may be the fifth or sixth time I've been here to this festival. And the best part is, each time we come... we come to this festival every year... every year, there is a different way it's going. I was thinking, \"This year, I was like at the beginning of this festival, it was very crowded.\" Then, as we were leaving, I said, \"I don't think it's going to be this crowded tonight.\" And you know what? It was crowded. We were coming, and we were like, \"It's going to be crowded. Oh, my gosh... we can't get through all these people, and we got to get that... I can't... it's so expensive. It's going to be crowded; we can't get in.\" And we finally got in. We had to park at the back. And it was crowded, but it was...\n\nI don't know what happened. Just for a moment, as soon as we got in, it was like we came back. This is a special moment. This is a time that I can share with my family. My grandson, he's very much a part of this. He likes to be there... every year... when I come. He's five years old. We're on Facebook, and he's been watching us. And so, every time I'm coming to California, I make Facebook posts and I have videos. And so, he and my grandsons, and my daughter, and my niece, they were watching this. They saw the video this morning, when we uploaded it, this video of this evening.\n\nSo, each time we come... we come, he holds my hand and says, \"Where are we going now? Grandma, we're coming to this place?\" And it's wonderful... because of that... because, he's learning, he's learning... He's seeing this world we are a part of. You know, each of us, we're a part of this world. We're a part of humanity. And through this world"

So common, in fact, that in New Zealand people even refer to them by the name \"trotter\"!\n\nMy kids also seem to love them, but they often don't enjoy our regular white potato variety. With the right potatoes (yoga beans are one great option), I find they like them much better. They're low in starch, much less likely to be too sticky, and they have a crunchy skin, which my kids love!\n\n# FOR THE BAKED POTATO\n\n1 medium-sized Yukon gold potato or 1 medium-sized yoga bean potato\n\n1 teaspoon oil (divided)\n\nPinch of salt\n\nFreshly ground black pepper (optional)\n\n# FOR THE SALSA\n\n2 medium-sized peeled tomatoes, diced\n\n½ red onion, finely diced\n\n2 cloves of garlic, crushed\n\n1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves\n\n½ bunch of fresh coriander (1 cup), chopped\n\n1 tablespoon lime juice\n\nChili flakes (optional)\n\nSea salt (optional)\n\n# FOR THE EGGS\n\n6 eggs\n\n¼ cup vegetable oil\n\nJuice of ½ lemon\n\n½ red onion finely diced (optional)\n\n# ONCE AGAIN: REMEMBER THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN YOUR KIDS, SO PUT IN AS MUCH SEA SALT AND SPICES AS YOU LIKE\n\n**PREPARATION: WIDE**\n\n## FOR THE BAKED POTATO\n\nPreheat your oven to 400°F.\n\nBoil your potato for 10 minutes, until soft inside, and then take it out of the water and cool it down.\n\nCut the potato in half lengthwise through the skin, then cut it lengthwise again so you get two pieces, which you can then cut in three. (This way there's a lot less to clean up later!)\n\nHeat one teaspoon of the oil in a pan and add the potato halves, skin side down, on a baking tray so they are no thicker than 1 inch deep. Sprinkle the skin with salt and black pepper, if you like. Spray each half with a little water to help the skin open and cook through. You can then bake them in the oven for 20 minutes until the skins are crispy and the middle of the potato has some nice color and is warmed through. You can also, if you like, cook the potato halves in foil and steam them in a covered pan in the oven for 20 minutes.\n\n## FOR THE SALSA\n\nWhile the potato is cooking, make your salsa by combining the tomatoes, red onion, garlic, cilantro, and coriander. Mix well and season to taste. Then add the lime juice and chili flakes (if you like it), and sea salt to taste.\n\n## FOR THE EGGS\n\nMix your eggs with the oil, lemon juice, and red onion (if you added it to the salsa).\n\nFor your nonstick cooking dish, make sure that it is hot. Melt the rest of the oil in this pan, then put the egg and onion mixture into it. Immediately shake the pan and tilt it from side to side so that the eggs run down the sides and are cooked through on the bottom.\n\n#\n\n# Egg sandwich\n\nIf our daughter has been trying to get as much of her favorite things on her new tray as she can (and she will take the same approach as our son if I don't put limits on her for a while), we have tried making her a homemade egg sandwich.\n\nShe loves eggs and bacon, and of course I have tried to get more vegetables and fruits into our kids' diets, too. As a result, I find that we try to do things like this where we can combine veggies with meat when we feel things could be better balanced. And, I have to say, our kids like it.\n\n# FOR EGGS\n\n6 eggs\n\n2 teaspoons butter (divided)\n\nPinch of sea salt"

        "instruction": "Provide instructions for the given exercise.\n\nLeg Raises",
        "output": "Provide instructions for the given exercise.\n\nLeg Raises\n\nA good method for improving leg strength, the leg raise has you start off on your side. Lie on your left side with your right hand under your head. Bend your left knee toward your chest while raising your right leg up as high as possible. Hold on to the bottom of your right foot and, after your leg reaches the top position (parallel to the floor), lower it down slightly and then slowly raise it back up. Repeat by bending your left leg and raising your right leg up, doing as many as you can before repeating the first step. Rest whenever fatigue sets in.\n\nThis exercise is easy to do and is a great way to build up leg strength.\n\nRowing Exercise\n\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart, arms at your sides, palms facing outward. The movement for this exercise should look similar to a rowing motion. First, lift one arm, making sure your left hand is pointing toward you. Now, while keeping your arm raised, reach out with the other hand until your wrists are straight and there is a straight line from your fingertips to your ankles. Squeeze your hands together, and return to starting position. Repeat with the other hand.\n\nStart out slowly and gradually speed up, doing at least thirty-five rows (or about ten minutes) with each hand on alternate days.\n\n##\n\nIn this chapter, we present a selection of ten key exercises that will improve general balance and coordination, which should lead to better game play and a safer and more enjoyable experience.\n\nWalking Ledge\n\nThis helps develop core and balance strength as well as leg strength.\n\nStabilize on one leg and lean over to the side, while the other arm is held straight up in the air. When you are ready, lean back and raise your leg up as high as possible. When you reach your highest position, you should feel weak on your left foot and be unable to push down any harder. Keep up and down movements until you begin to feel strong on both legs. This exercise should be performed two times per day on alternate days.\n\nWalk the Ledge\n\nStart by walking up a two-inch ledge. You should be able to do this perfectly, every step with no hesitation.\n\nWalking the Ledge.\n\nOnce you reach the top, step down with your right foot, then step down with your left. Then cross your left foot over to your right foot. Step down on your left foot once more and continue on, crossing the left foot over your right foot again to the left and repeating this sequence until you reach the other side. This exercise can be scaled by first using a single step or two steps.\n\nSquat (Calf Raise)\n\nFirst stand on the edge of your bed with your toes curled, knees bent, and feet flat on the bed. You should be able to look down to your toes, but stand straight in order to maintain your balance.\n\nSquat (Calf Raise).\n\nTo begin, bend your legs slowly in a forward motion to lower your buttocks behind your heels in a squatting motion. Then pull yourself up to your previous position by straightening your knees. Continue in this manner until you feel good, and then repeat two to three more times with a rest time in between until you feel you can do more. Next, try doing the same thing with your heels resting on a chair or a step—something that's two to three inches away from the ground. Squating in this pose until you are unable to continue and then relaxing for about ten seconds is a perfect warm-up before performing this next exercise.\n\nStanding Squat (Lunge)\n\nBegin from the previous squatting position with your hands resting on the ground behind your heels.\n\nStanding squat (lunge).\n\nNow walk back one foot and lower your body so your right knee is bent. Your right hand should be placed on the ground before your right heel, and your left knee should be bent; your left hand should be placed on the ground before your left foot. Stand tall to take a left diagonal. Walk over to your left-hand side with your right arm extended for balance. Bend down into a squatting position and lower your right knee so it touches the ground. Then push yourself back up as high as you can, with your left hand on the ground before your left foot and your right hand behind your right foot.\n\nRepeat these steps moving from left to right. This is a full-body exercise that strengthens all major muscle groups, and it's a great one to perform in the morning before you eat to keep your digestive system moving. This exercise can be performed two to three times with a rest time between sets.\n\nDumbbell Press-ups\n\nWe'"

You can also modify the size of the image on the dialog box, which can be useful if the size of the image you selected didn't fit the page size. Select the **OK** button to set the image.\n\nYou can also insert a picture that you have saved on the hard drive in the Insert Object dialog box, without first selecting the Object Tools. The dialog box appears with a folder icon so you know you are seeing a file saved on your computer, rather than a file that you want to open in a program like Paint.com.

Select **Open** to open and display the image in the document.\n\nAlternate View of File Folder Insert Object Dialog Box\n\nIf you want to change the image you just placed on the page, you can rename, delete, or save a copy of the selected image in the Document Library.\n\n#  **Displaying Images**\n\nYou can change image attributes for better display or better control. If your image is too large for the page, you can choose it from the drop-down menu to change its size or to display it in a toolbox on the page. You can also use the Size and Position pane in the Format tab of the Control Panel to change the height and width of an object, including an inserted image. The Tool Pane or the Control Panel also lets you change the location and size of an image. If you have many pages with images, you might want to add a Style to apply to all the images on the page.

To change the size of an image, select Format --> Image and then choose the desired Image Size. But sometimes you want to add a border around an image to increase the impact of an ad or any type of image you place on a page. If you want to add a frame around an object, but not change the size of the image, choose Insert --> Image --> Add a Frame Next to Text to open the Add a Frame dialog box.\n\n**1.** Select one of the default framing styles, such as No Border.\n\n**2.** Select the **Color** option. Select a color on the color palette.\n\n**3.** To change the **Size** of the border, choose a size.\n\n**4.** Click **Apply** to apply any changes you made.\n\n**5.** Choose **OK** to display the frame around the selected image.\n\n### Notes:\n\nThe Add a Frame dialog box also accepts custom drawing and graphic files, such as an .emf or .wmf file.

Are you struggling with the idea of whether or not you can do what you want in life?\n\nWhat if you could write a book and do what you want to do, and not be afraid to fail?\n\nWhat if by writing a book, you could tell people to write a book or take the necessary action, and help to provide the guidance they need to get it done?\n\nYou'd help change their lives the same way Dr. Seus changed your life.\n\nHere's a question for you:\n\nHow can you do what you want in life, by living in your own way, telling the stories from your mind, and taking action to get them published?\n\nThe world doesn't care how much you love it.\n\nIt won't give you a break just because you're willing to let people in.\n\nThis is how I define the difference between the artist and the self-promoters.\n\nThe selfish artists are selfish because they only see themselves, and the world sees them as selfish as well because they've made so many people feel like they don't want us in their world. They're self-serving and don't realize that every time they don't share, they deprive others of the chance to do so, whether that's at a job or the world at large. This causes people to act selfish.\n\nThe selfish self-promoter only knows how to share things they want, not things they don't want others to have. They're doing it for themselves. Their work is self-serving.\n\nI'm not saying you can't have both.\n\nYes, you can have selfish and self-serving artistry and promotion.\n\nThis isn't about what my friends think.\n\nThis is about what my readers think.\n\nThis is about what their friends think.\n\nThis is about the people who want to do what you're telling them to do, or who need a push in a more productive direction.\n\nWhen I'm working on a book project, and every time I look at it or start it again, I think there's no way I'm going to write it this time, but I do.\n\nI have to know I can deliver when people want what I know.\n\nI am a selfish creator.\n\nYou're a selfless creator.\n\nNow how do you change your thinking so people will want what you have to offer?\n\nWhat if you didn't have to ask yourself this question, and could just start writing what you wanted to say without worrying about people?\n\nWhat if you just did it, and stopped worrying about how your readers would see you?\n\nI know how my readers think, and I know how they'd like to change if they'd just take action. They know in their heart it's not about me.\n\nIf I focus on them, then I focus less on myself and the idea that they would judge me and more on what I know they're looking for, and what I know they're trying to accomplish, and what I can give to help them get there.\n\nThis is how you change your thinking, by doing the one thing that you love to do or the thing you're trying to learn:\n\nJust do it.\n\nLet go of all this worry about what they'll think of you to do it. Then forget about it afterward.\n\nHow can you help more people to do what they want to do instead of having the world get in your way?\n\nThink about the way you're helping more people to make their dreams come true and you'll understand. You'll also be much happier.\n\nRemember: You can't expect people to see what you're trying to say, or who you are and your work, if you don't teach them.\n\nWhen is the best time to tell someone about something you like?\n\nWhen are you the least likely to get judgment?\n\nWhen you're talking to people in your own life who are doing things you're trying to do.\n\nWhen they're making you happy and helping you to enjoy what you'"

        "output": "Design a simple training challenge on Strava that everyone could attend. Create a story for your organization that everyone could participate in.\nThis would become a training exercise for people to run that they could then use at work to get their teams talking about mental health.\nNow, we've got two big problems. The first one is that people don't run. There's a big barrier to overcome. What would it take to get people to run one mile? What if we could do that by solving one other problem, but in a way that got people talking about mental health and wellbeing.\nWe would want to run on top of the mental health issue. We'd want people to find it at the top level of this story. But we'd build that into the story of the training exercise because then people would engage and run for something bigger than themselves.\nSo why is it that people don't run? Well I don't know the statistics, but I'm guessing it has to do with two things.\nOne, it's hard. Running is hard. Our society's pretty good at putting obstacles in the way of running, like how far you have to run, what you have to wear, and what shape you have to be when you start. If you're just starting to run it's hard for you.\nTwo, it's time-consuming. Running is just time-consuming. It's time-consuming at the time of your day and the day of life when you're trying to juggle other things.\nSo instead of running, people do a bunch of things. Instead of running they walk. Instead of running they run and walk a bit, or they bike, or they're in some other physical activity.\nSo to address the runner problem, we needed to figure out \"What would be simpler for people? What would be more accessible and easier to do to get people running? And what type of physical activity is there that's easier to get started with?\"\nAnd there's a huge one for people who are just starting out.\nIt's a training program for people to run.\nNow, we don't run. We do 30-minute exercise programs instead. It only takes 30 minutes and you do it three times a week. And the best part is that you do it standing up and you talk to other people.\nIt's a program created by another trainer, and we've modified it. The great program you can find on the internet. We built a simple training exercise into it using the 30-Minute Training Program and it's something that you can do right now.\nSo how do we make it work?\nWell the reason there's a 63% dropout rate for these exercise classes is because people get uncomfortable and don't talk. But what happens when you get 100 people and you have to have an entire class talk?\nWell, at this moment we're not in a class. We're a group of just 5 or 6 people.\nWe are a group of a few peers. We're here because we want to know how to talk about our feelings and we know what's going on. We could talk about that because we're peers in a group not strangers.\nBut for us to do that we have to be comfortable in the way that we're currently not so we're in pain in a sense.\nSo part of the training is just to say, \"You're doing OK, it's the first hour. It's not going to be comfortable. It's going to feel weird. You're not going to feel the same way as you did yesterday.\"\nAnd people in this group need to know that they're not alone. We all need to know when people in the group reach out and say, \"Hey, I didn't want to get up and say anything today. It's OK. Let's just go on and keep talking about what we're feeling.\" When other people reach out and say that's just going to be really helpful.\nAnd then, the other thing we need to do is to tell people that they're doing fine. It's a first and it's a good one. It's normal for people to feel uncomfortable. It's normal for people to feel strange about new things.\nAnd then the next time we go in, it is way better. We've got it.\nSo the next time we go in, we have one group of people, we just got in and we did one session. And this time we've got 100 people. So we've now got a whole group. And in order to make it feel more comfortable you can talk about what you're going through with the people around you"

        "output": "Suggest some names for a friendly group in telegram.\n\n1\n\nIn our friendly group, if one member calls from the local telephone booth, the friend can call from anywhere by paying the local calls to the central  office.\n\n    001  001 \n    010  010 \n    110  110 \n    111  111 \n\n     -\n     \n    11111\n\nNow, if the other member calls the central office with number 112, he can hear their conversation. If the first member's phone is disconnected, he can call the central office with number 101.\n\nBut this procedure is too slow.\n\nCan this problem be easily simplified? Can you write a program that solves all these problems in a few moments?\n\nA: This problem is actually very simple.\nFirst, you need to create a list of all the phone numbers of the group.\nThen you need to create a simple network diagram, so that all nodes are connected and the number of edges between each pair of nodes is equal to the number of common nodes. For example, you would have four edges between the nodes 110 and 101; 111 and 001; 111 and 010; and 001 and 010.\nThis diagram is easy to create using some simple logic. You can use simple loops to go through all the phone numbers and make the connections - but be careful not to create more than one node in the diagram for a single phone number, so that you can easily distinguish 123-456 from 1234 56.\nThe next step is to create a list of pairs of phone numbers; that is, a list of all the pairs of nodes that are connected. These pairs will represent possible phone conversations for each user of the phone system.\nFinally, you need to create a program that takes any phone number as input and then prints out the possible phone conversations for that user.\nTo understand how this works, let's say that you have a phone number written in the format 05-12-34-18, where the first three digits indicate your local area code, and the last three digits indicate your phone number. In this case, your local area code is 123, and your phone number is 123418.\nNow that you have some idea of how this works, let's move on to implementation. Because a phone has only 10 numbers, it can connect to at most nine other phones. However, if you add a \"zero\" to every number, it can then connect to a total of 10 other phones. As an example, the phone with the number 05123418 can connect with the numbers 000123418, 05123428, 05123438, and 05123448. And so on.\nThe next question is how to know which phone has connected to which phone. The simplest way is simply to remember which phone connects to which phone, and keep an inventory of all the current connections. In this way, if a phone connects with a different phone, you simply change the inventory.\nLet's consider how this problem is solved using a binary tree. First, draw the tree, with the local area code as the root and the phone number as the leaves. Now you can have an associated structure that is a bitmap of the tree, where each bit indicates that one of the connections exists. For example, if you connect the root with one leaf, you would set bit one to be one. You can then go through this structure and see how each tree leaf connects with each other tree leaf using bitmasks until you cover all the branches.\nThe final step is to print out any phone that has all its possible connections as well as possible phone calls that would be made from that phone."

        "output": "Write what the pronunciation of the given word sounds like. Follow the \"Google pronunciation dictionary\" scheme for phonetic spelling.\n\ninterpretations (of a word)\nThe dictionary definition of the word should be written in the following way: 'the interpretation that is based on the known meanings, the context, and the way the word has been used in similar contexts.' In other words, 'an explanation of what the word would mean in a given context'.\nExample:\nWe believe that the 'interpretations' that could be written are not 'one meaning' but should be the meanings that are available depending on the context. We believe that they should include a description of the context and how the interpreter has used this word in a related context.\n\nContext\nEvery time a word is used in an article, the context should be mentioned.\nExample:\nWe would write:\nIt is commonly used to describe the place where someone lives or the place where an event takes place.\n\nThe definition\nThe definition for the word should be written in a clear, concise way. The definition for the word should be stated as soon as possible after the word appears in the article.\nExample:\nWe would write:\nit can be used to describe a type of event, a place where the event takes place.\n\nThis should be the beginning of the definition. The remainder of it should follow the first part of the definition.\nThe definition must specify the 'type of event', 'where the event takes place'. Example:\nAn award ceremony is an event that is held to recognize the skills of people who are very talented and are very important in a particular area.\nAn awards ceremony occurs in a particular place that is called 'a hall'.\n\nExample:\nWe would do something that is not in the article because we can find the meaning for the word. However, the way to find how the word could be interpreted is by using 'one part of the definition', 'the context' and 'how the word has been used in a similar context'.\n\nwe have found where one part of the definition and context of 'award ceremony' is used.\nThe word 'award ceremony' is used in a definition of the following words:\nAn awards ceremony occurs at a hall in honor of people who help in an area of interest. An award ceremony occurs to recognize the skills and talent of people who are very good.\n\nThis is how the 'one part of the definition', 'the context' and 'how the word has been used in a similar context' can be used to explain the meaning of one word.\n\nInterpretation\nWhen there are multiple people saying something, each part of the word that is important should be underlined.\nExample:\nWe wrote:\nIt has different interpretations because it is used by several people differently.\n\nThe word 'interpretations' comes underlined.\n\nMeaning\nIt is important to know how a word is interpreted by different people. We should describe the 'how'.\nExample:\nwe use 'how' to describe the idea that the given word should be used with a certain context and how it's used in a different context.\n\nUsing a word or a word combination in a different part of the article\nSometimes it is very helpful to put the word or words somewhere else in the article. We can check that the context makes sense by writing in another place in the article.\n\nThe description of a place and/or the event\nSometimes the word or words that are used to describe a place and/or an event can be described at the beginning of a part of the article.\nExample:\nwe wrote:\nIt can be used to describe a type of event or to describe a place where...\n\nWe added another sentence to the definition of the word. We can repeat a sentence and this becomes part of the definition.\n\nThe meaning of a word that is given\nSometimes we use a word to explain another word.\nExample:\nWe wrote:\nthis expression is also used to describe...\n\nThe meaning of a word that is given should be in the part of the article where this description is written.\n\nWhat and Why\nSometimes it is very helpful to describe 'what' happened and 'why' it happened.\n\nThe meaning of the word and the meaning of the article\nSometimes some other words must be added to show in what part of the article the word is used.\n\nIt is similar to the definition and the definition is described as: 'what is the meaning of a word or a word combination and how is it used in an article'.\nExample:\nwe described 'what is the meaning of a word or a word combination' which we can describe by writing the words in the other part of the article where the word is used.\n\nThe meaning of the article and how it has been used by many people in"

Her husband replies, \"Why? I know how to do it right. It's not rocket science. I can do it myself, you just want to go with me so I don't forget something.\"\n\n\"It is not rocket science\" means that this task is something that does not have to be complex. In the example above, the woman wants her husband to go with her to the store.\n\nA dog is chasing a chicken. A man tries to scare the dog away from the chicken by throwing rocks at it. The dog responds, \"It's not rocket science. You can't stop me from wanting chicken.\"\n\n\"It's not rocket science\" is not referring to scientific knowledge but rather how something is done. In the example above, the dog just wants to get the chicken and he doesn't care how he gets it. He thinks it is okay to chase it down until it is dead.\n\nThe dog got stuck in a hole, so his owner went to get his ladder to let him out. When he got there with a ladder, the dog says, \"It's not rocket science. You just put your head down the hole and look me in the eyes.\"\n\nIn this context, the dog's comment means that there was a way to get him out of the hole but he was smart enough to save his owner the effort.\n\nWhat is the meaning of the following idiom?\n\n\"It's the thought that counts\" means that love or appreciation is of great importance.\n\nA woman was very depressed one day and felt as if her life was empty. As she was sitting on the bed, she started to cry. One of her friends came to her and asked her what was wrong. She said, \"Well, I feel empty inside.\" Her friend replied, \"You got an empty house with two floors and three bedrooms. Don't put up your head and think that life is over. It's nothing but just a stage, and we're there because we need to get over that stage.\"\n\nThis passage shows the value of friendship and love. It is possible that in a relationship it is not about the possession of things. It's about the closeness of those with whom you are sharing life. The example above shows that the woman has two houses and the thought of no one living up in her second home does not concern her. In other words, it's not just about houses. It's about the love and companionship shared.\n\nA man walks into a bar with a horse, a chicken, a cow, and a pig. The bartender asks if the cow wanted a drink. The man asked, \"Why would a cow want a drink? The cow says, \"Because you just heard my wife and I had a baby.\"\n\nThe passage shows the way a woman might encourage her husband.

With the power of quantum computing, we can solve problems such as the factoring of large prime numbers, develop better medical drugs, predict stock trades, and develop new and more efficient materials.\nWhile quantum computing is still in its early stages and only few quantum computers are built to this date, the future looks very bright. By 2027 it is estimated that there will be over 11,000 quantum computers to solve such complex tasks. Here is the timeline of the quantum evolution:\nIn 1958, Richard Feynman laid the foundation of quantum computing, which was called “it from bit”.\nIn 1989, Peter Shor developed the first practical quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers. Using this algorithm, a classical computer may factor a 160-digit number in just 26 hours, while traditional factoring took a couple days.\nIn 2001, Richard Feynman showed the possibility of a quantum super position using a single photon. This work led the way for the development of the first quantum computer.\nIn 2000’s, a number of physicists and mathematicians developed new algorithms and qubits to develop a more robust computing system.\nIn 2001, the first real-world quantum computer was demonstrated by a team of researchers at IBM.\nIn 2006, the number of qubits increased from 16 to as many as 72 by a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Since then, the number is still rapidly increasing.\nIn 2011, Google announced the world’s first application of quantum computing by using 54 qubits in a quantum computer. Today, Google has demonstrated a 54-qubit quantum computer that can do a lot of things.\nThe progress of quantum computing continues at a rapid speed, making quantum computing a growing technology with a high potential to influence future development as well as create new business opportunities. While the application of traditional computing has already been applied to all aspects of business and everyday life, it’s time to start thinking of using quantum technology to boost business development as well as create new business opportunities.\nAs the concept of computing is no longer limited to the traditional computers but has already evolved to quantum computers, it is necessary for all organizations and businesses to start taking actions to transform their business practices and processes.\nQuantum Cryptography can protect digital information from being extracted, modified, or tampered with by malicious entities. By connecting two quantum-secure devices such as quantum chips, or by using the same technology and techniques as the quantum key distribution, security is increased both ways. The data and communication between two parties can be protected and assured of authenticity using the Quantum Cryptography technology.\nThe Quantum Cryptography will pave the way for new and improved computer security, such as quantum cryptography, quantum computer chips, and blockchain technology. It will also open up new opportunities for businesses to create new products and services that harness these technologies. Quantum cryptography will also help create a more secure, transparent, and unhackable communication networks that no current encryption system can.\nQuantum computing is a fast-evolving technology, and it is the future of computational power. It will open up new opportunities for businesses to leverage the power of the quantum computer for improved business processes and improved efficiency. It will also help businesses create new products and services that harness the power of the quantum computer.\nIf you are interested in quantum computing and how it can help your business and industry, reach out to us.

It’s usually compared to an animal-based diet.\nAre animal-products healthy?\nAnimal-sourced foods are often compared to plant-sourced foods. Animal-sourced foods, also known as animal-sourced foods, include meat, eggs, dairy and other products derived from animals like fish or poultry.\nAre plant-based diets vegan?\nThe “plant-based” diet is a type of diet that emphasizes the consumption of food sources from plants. It is very different from the “vegan” diet, which excludes all animal-based foods. The term “plant-based” can refer to a meal consisting simply of plants or to a high-protein, low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.\nDo not be fooled by the use of the term “plant-based.” It can be difficult to determine whether or not meat is vegan. There are some animals that are raised and fattened at a slow pace, which is known as “organic meat,” but their meat still comes from a farm, and they are still animals.\nVeganism is a vegetarian diet that excludes all animal-sourced food products, including eggs and dairy products. Unlike a vegetarian diet, in which only plant-sourced products are included, a vegan diet includes no animal products, such as meat, chicken, or fish. Because of this, most vegan diets are vegan and meatless.\nIs meat a plant-sourced food?\nPlant-sourced foods are foods that do not come from animals.

        "output": "How can I develop my critical thinking skills?\nHow do I start using the CPD system?\nWhat is the point of the CPD system?\nWhy is there a CPD system?\nCPD is training, that helps medical professionals to develop their skills and improve their practice. CPD is a key component in maintaining the quality of health care by keeping professionals up-to-date and ensuring that current standards are implemented.\nAs a doctor, you are expected to remain educated and competent for the duration of your career by taking part in CPD activities. A CPD system enables doctors to build a personal record of activities undertaken, as well as help build and document evidence required for recertification, which may include evidence of relevant training and education.\nThis is the most popular type of CPD activity for doctors, as attending conferences allows you to gain knowledge and develop your skills by listening to talks given by experts. Another added benefit for going to conferences and talks is hearing about interesting cases and different approaches to clinical issues.\nYou may also choose to attend conferences in your specialty or area of interest, giving you the opportunity to network with other doctors and other healthcare professional at the event and learn directly from their experiences. You may also be motivated enough to attend events after witnessing the presentation of a colleague or someone else in the field you admire.\nOnline learning and eLearning courses are a great, low-cost option for CPD. If you have the time, you can study online and in your own time – something that some doctors find difficult to manage due to their work hours and tight schedules. You can choose to sign up for a course and then make it your objective to complete the course and pass the course assessments within the allotted time.\nYou can also choose to sign up to courses as they become available online. You can often search for free courses and paid courses on many healthcare platforms. If you are looking for an online course or an online program to improve an area of your practice, you are suggested to explore health courses online.\nYou can also choose to take online or online courses that are specifically for doctors. You can gain practical experience that you can apply in everyday practice by completing case studies and clinical assessments to earn qualifications that can help increase your employability (if you are looking for a new job) and improve your qualification levels as a doctor.\nOnline resources are often available through organizations or institutions such as universities. If you do not already belong to an institution or organization and want to do CPD courses as a way to improve your skills, you can join one that is right for you. For instance, some doctors and healthcare professionals are members of the Royal College of Physicians and take part in continuous professional development courses.\nYou can also find a number of accredited online courses on many training platforms, including the University of Nottingham. This type of activity is suitable for both doctors and non-doctors, and there is no limit to the number of CPD courses you can complete – you can do as many CPD courses as you like.\nOther useful sources for CPD courses include the British Medical Journal (BMA), the Federation of Royal Colleges of Physicians (FRCP).\nDoctors do not need to be experts in a particular area. You can start by reading about healthcare topics, blogs and other health and medical related journals in order to improve your understanding and knowledge of your field of practice. You can also contribute your knowledge of a certain topic to a healthcare blog, which can be a useful way of documenting your CPD activities.\nAn online platform called Healthcaring is a free online knowledge community that connects healthcare professionals worldwide including doctors, allied health professionals, and healthcare students. It aims to help members develop their expertise and knowledge.\nOne way to help your CPD activities lead to meaningful learning is to reflect on your learning and activities. You can make notes of your learning and keep a journal or some sort of recordbook to keep evidence of your activities. Alternatively, you can create a blog or a personal website to document all your learning and activities that you did.\nIf you look for a good example, some medical students blog about their learning during their clinical placements or medical education courses. There is no need to make your blog public to benefit from the experience. You can create a blog yourself or find other doctors and healthcare professionals who have created a professional blog.\nAn online platform called CPD Learning is a community for doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals where they can learn, discuss and share professional and clinical best practices. Doctor’s blogs discuss topics that are not discussed in other medical forums such as lifestyle, nutrition and fitness. They also discuss their learning and experiences and share their clinical views when reviewing research or literature.\nA good example would be to find another doctor online that has similar interests and build connections with them. You can get involved in online conversations on social media, forums and other online communities. You can create a relationship with them and build connections through which you can exchange CPD information from time to time"

        "output": "What are the major challenges faced by the education sector today?\nIn terms of education, there are four major challenges. The first is the growing social divide, and how that is reflected in educational outcomes, with the majority of universities and state schools remaining reserved for only the more advantaged groups. The second challenge is the impact of the BREXIT vote on students looking to study in the UK from outside of England. The third is the impact of the UK Budget on the fees for postgraduate students studying in the UK. The fourth is the rise in tuition fees that will be payable for students starting at UK universities in September.\nThe UK education system is under significant scrutiny. What can be done to address these growing concerns?\nThe key factors to consider in looking to improve standards of education include the need for greater flexibility in the delivery of courses, greater financial support for students that enables them to complete their studies, greater opportunities for students to experience international exchange and work placements, and greater recognition of prior learning and experience.\nWhy should the education sector turn to technology in order to solve its problems?\nTechnology in the education sector makes it easier to manage academic performance. For example, our platform, Academic Assessment, makes it even easier for students to complete and submit their assignments. This also makes life a lot easier for our customers managing assessment submissions, both on and off-campus, and with any size of study cohort.\nHow does Academic Assessment make it easier for students and institutions to work together in order to achieve success?\nOur platform makes it easy for assessment submissions to be completed by individual students and then sent back to us for storage and management, and also easy for us to provide results quickly to our clients to enable them to provide feedback to their respective students. This in turn makes it possible for students to focus on improving the areas of their assessments where they have achieved fewer marks, and also where they have got 100%, meaning they can focus on areas where to improve. This is something we know many UK students struggle to do during their study.\nTo find out more about Academic Assessment check out our website in https://www.academicat.com/\nPlease note you should not contact us with any sales, marketing or product queries or details.

The method of studying consumer behavior usually depends on a number of factors, which include the purpose of research, the environment of research, the availability of data and technology, etc.\nConsumer expenditure is the primary aggregate measure of consumer behavior and represents total spending on goods and services by consumers. The National Income and Product Accounts is the official federal measure of consumer expenditure.\nConsumer behaviour is how people like you make decisions about purchases, such as a computer, mobile phone, washing machine or car. The choices you make about what you buy and why, is what constitutes consumer behaviour.\nHow are consumer behaviour and purchasing intention related to one another? For consumers, the purchase decision involves a combination of rational and emotional factors. Rational factors consist of product quality, price, etc. A consumer’s emotions can be affected if they have previous experiences with a retail store.\nFactors important to purchase behavior include age, education, income, and social class. Other factors which affect purchase behavior depend on whether or not the consumer is buying for themselves or someone else. Purchase behavior depends on personality traits, as well.\nConsumer behavior can be defined as how the people make decisions based on their personal, psychological, cultural, and social characteristics when selecting products. This is where psychology helps. … The five factors are: personality, attitudes, social influence, perception, and memory.\nThe most important effect of consumer behavior on the economy is that it changes spending behavior.

In Communicating Across Cultures, a masterful examination of communication problems resulting from cultural and linguistic differences, the authors offer a new model for understanding these questions.\nThe authors show how communication between people with different cultures and languages involves three interacting components: the interlocutors involved, the communication task involved, and the contextual elements. They demonstrate how these three interacting components influence the way individual people experience and manage themselves so as to make communication successfully productive.\nAmong the many situations examined are: encounters across cultures at international conferences or trade fairs, business negotiations, language-based difficulties encountered by international students, and the process of foreign language acquisition. The authors analyze how people may deal with different types of messages and also show why some messages may receive the same response regardless of who is sending them.\nThe book offers an effective approach for understanding the linguistic and cultural characteristics that can make communication across cultural and linguistic boundaries so difficult. In the process, it provides a general framework for understanding communication.

        "output": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications. Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system has rapidly become a popular tool for biological experiments. It offers both high precision and speed, but it is also controversial as it has the potential to disrupt biological processes and affect genetic sequences.\nThe application of CRISPR could be used to correct genetic diseases by removing diseased genes or to enhance biological processes, such as disease protection. While there are many potential benefits of this technology, there are also many potential concerns and ethical questions that must be considered.\nLet’s explore the technical details of CRISPR-Cas9, as well as its potential applications and ethical implications as an essential part of the modern biological research toolkit.\nWhat is CRISPR?\nCRISPR is the acronym for ‘Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats,’ which is the term given to a specialized type of genome-editing technology that can be easily adapted and modified by scientists.\nIt’s been called the “DNA scissors,” but the real power behind CRISPR lies in its unique set of tools that allow scientists to edit DNA at specific locations.\nThe system was discovered in bacteria in 2001 by Francisco Mojica, who observed that bacteria used CRISPR sequences to resist viruses.\nThe CRISPR sequence is a series of spacers (short DNA sequences) and repeats (longer DNA sequences). The spacers are unique for each organism, and they are found in the CRISPR sequence.\nWhen a viral sequence enters the CRISPR sequences, which are complementary to the virus’s DNA (only the bases that are found on the opposite strand of the CRISPR are matching), the CRISPR system uses this as a signal to cut the viral DNA into smaller fragments.\nViral sequences are found in bacterial cells and cannot be replicated or used for the benefit of the host bacterium, so the bacterium naturally destroys the viral DNA.\nAs a result of the CRISPR-mediated cell destruction, the CRISPR sequence remains intact, and over time it becomes smaller as viral sequences are broken down and removed. When there is nothing more that the bacteria can do to combat the virus, they have lost their usefulness.\nA major breakthrough came in 2012, when scientists showed how to remove a single CRISPR sequence. The CRISPR-Cas9 system uses a protein and RNA (ribonucleic acid) to selectively target genes and cut DNA in specific locations.\nBy modifying the RNA in different ways, scientists can target specific regions. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed further over the past few years, and it is now one of the most powerful genome editing tools in use.\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system has made a huge impact on research by reducing the time and resources required for gene editing. It is now possible to alter genes in organisms that were previously very difficult to work with.\nCRISPR can also help understand the role of genes in diseases, as it allows researchers to experiment in ways that they could not have before and to monitor gene activity in cells. CRISPR is used to edit both plants and animals and has the potential to help solve many of our biological mysteries.\nWhat is Cas9?\nOne component of the CRISPR-Cas9 system is the Cas9 protein. Cas9 is a type of nuclease (nuclear acid enzyme), which is defined as an enzyme that can cut DNA at specific sites. Nucleic acids play an important role in the functioning of cells.\nNucleic acids can both be found in the cytoplasm (outside the nucleus) or in the nucleus itself. In the cytoplasm, they can be found in two forms: A and B.\nWhen a cell is exposed to viruses or their genetic sequences, it uses the A and B nucleic acids to create a new defense. This defense will help the cell to protect itself from viral sequences and to repair damaged parts of its genetic material.\nThe Cas9 protein is part of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. It has three main functions:\nTo guide the nucleases to specific parts of the genome (the chromosomes inside the cell);\nTo act as the enzyme to cut the DNA; and\nTo act as a regulator that controls the expression of genes.\nAs seen in Figure 1, there are three parts to the CRISPR-Cas9 system:\nA single-stranded RNA, which contains the sequence of the target gene\nA guide RNA, which gives the Cas9 nuclease the right information about where it should be cutting\nThe protein Cas9\nAll three parts must work together to facilitate cutting the genome at the correct location.

The publication explores the relationship between traditional and emerging news media and the role social media play in amplifying or challenging the credibility of news information.\nThe second work, which has been accepted for publication in the journal, is a scoping review of different approaches to understanding and addressing the spread of misinformation in social media. In it we present and discuss some of the main challenges associated with measuring and understanding these various approaches to understanding misinformation through different social media lenses and practices like algorithms, moderation policies and public engagement.\nOur last paper, which is currently under review, has just been uploaded to Sage for review and, together with a team of colleagues, we have a new paper recently accepted for publication in the Journal of Information Science. This paper considers the relationship between online news articles, online opinion articles and social media platforms as a means of understanding how people create knowledge and how these processes interact with algorithms to determine which news and opinion pieces become widely shared online."

        "output": "How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?\nEating habits and behaviors are strongly influenced by the sociocultural and economic contexts that surround us. The purpose of this course is to examine how social, cultural, and economic factors relate to nutrition behaviors and outcomes, and to understand how knowledge of these factors can be used to promote nutrition-related behaviors and outcomes.\nThis is a two-credit course that fulfills requirements for a general education course in interdisciplinary studies. The course is required for students in the Social Sciences program, as well as the Applied Life and Health Sciences program in the School of Sciences and Engineering, and is available for a variety of other degree or certificate programs.\nThe course is a blend of theory and case studies, with emphasis on contemporary topics in the United States and around the world. Examples will be given that provide the context for discussion and that emphasize the social, economic, and cultural factors that shape our food choices.\nStudents will come to understand (1) how food choices can be influenced by culture and climate, family and community, and government policies; (2) how gender roles and traditional food values affect food consumption practices; (3) how cultural traditions and religious beliefs affect the consumption of food; and (4) how food safety can be influenced by a person's social class, race, and ethnicity.\n1. Explain why people may have different attitudes about food.\n2. Critically evaluate the evidence for and implications of dietary guidance provided by different groups and organizations.\n3. Critically assess the role of social and economic factors in shaping personal food choices and practices.\n4. Demonstrate communication skills in interacting with students, faculty, peers, and staff.\n5. Identify issues of cultural and social diversity and bias, and present appropriate ways of addressing these issues.\n6. Synthesize knowledge of basic nutrition (diet, exercise, health).\n7. Plan and carry out research and develop research skills beyond those usually seen in the classroom.\n8. Analyze health care and public policy/reform issues.\n9. Demonstrate critical abilities to analyze public health and related research.\n10. Analyze a public health issue based on multiple aspects of health."

        "output": "Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species.\nDiscuss common misconceptions about evolution and its mechanisms.\nIdentify the common and unique characteristics of the Cambrian Period fossils.\nIdentify and describe the most prominent organisms in the Cambrian Period.\nDescribe how the endocardium, mesocardium, and myocardium of the heart help to circulate and transport oxygenated blood through a vertebrate.\nIdentify the two forms of blood cells.\nCompare and contrast hemoglobin and myoglobin.\nExplain the differences between anemia and dysplasia (both genetic and nutritional).\nConclude with strategies, resources and sources of information for future consideration.\nCourse Introduction and Review Overview\nThe term evolution literally means change or alteration and refers to changes in organisms over time due to changes in the environment. The term has been thrown around by many people in many ways for many definitions over its existence.\nFirst the word “evo” may be derived from the word “evolve,” which means changing. However, that explanation can come more from Greek and Greek philosophy than from American vernacular.\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin coined the term in his book, On the Origin of Species, as a means to replace Lamarck’s term “transmutation,” because Lamarck’s ideas were too radical for the public audience.\nIn addition, Darwin was trying to distinguish between the theory of transmutation, which he thought was too radical to be considered, and “natural selection,” his much simpler idea of genetic adaptation.\nEvolution is important because it provides the mechanism whereby life has adapted to their particular environment. Some organisms are adapted to live in the ocean, some are adapted to live on the ground, etc. Each time an organism comes in contact with a new environmental stimulus or stimulus in an environment to which it is not adapted, it will either mutate or adapt.\nA mutation can either cause an organism to either be more resistant to that particular stimulus or kill it.\nIf an organism survives, it likely has a change in its chromosome makeup.\nOrganisms with a change in their chromosome makeup become new species.\nNatural selection is a selection process in which organisms with certain adaptive characteristics have higher reproductive rates than organisms that do not. This selection process continues over time until the majority of organisms in the environment are of one common adaptive character.\nIf an organism survives, it likely has a change in its chromosome makeup. Organisms with a change in their chromosome makeup become new species. The number of new species in an evolutionary lineage tends to increase rapidly when the environmental conditions are stable. During periods of significant change in environmental conditions, the number of new and diverged species tends to decrease.\nTo help organize this course, we have included four different major topics.\nM.A.R.E.\nThe first topic we will cover is the “Mass Awakening to Religions Event”, or “M.A.R.E.” This topic is comprised of two main topics.\nThe first topic deals with what the M.A.R.E. was and why it occurred. The second topic deals with the events, which created a new paradigm for the way people saw the cosmos and the way we interact with it.\nThis is the first time in history that the human race was able to create artificial life by synthesizing it. This breakthrough has changed the way life on Earth is created and has given us the ability to recreate new life in different environments.\nAt the same time, this synthetic life made it possible for us to create new species by combining the genes of two different life forms without the need for sexual reproduction, which has resulted in increasing the rates of hybridization between species.\nThis is the culmination of our understanding of how species are created and how they evolve. We are now able to create the genetic structure of life through synthetic life and create new species of life through hybridization.\nThe second topic is titled “Evolution: The Basics.” This is the most fundamental and important topic of evolution because it discusses the way in which life has been evolving for millions of years.\nIt is important because it describes the way in which life adapts to change its environment in order to survive. It also describes how species are generated by the processes of natural selection and genetic drift, which then leads to their adaptive changes.\nIn previous courses, we have discussed the concepts of genetic mutation and mutation selection, and how they play a major role in the evolution and adaptation of species.\nWe will further explore this topic here with the help of some examples from the Cambrian Period of life. This period was characterized by an abundance of different species, including many that do not exist today. We will discuss the adaptations these species have to both a physical and a social environment.\nThen, we will explore how these adaptations led to the evolution and generation of"

What have you told him about me? I'm not of noble birth.\"\n\n\"Not at all, milady. He might think your father was a peasant, but you are a queen. Your title would be Queen of England.\"\n\n\"Then he'll probably know I'm not a nobleborn knight.\"\n\n\"You said you were an orphan. Surely you could say you were raised among knights and that you were knighted. He'll be more likely to believe you were taught about knights when you were very young. You could point to the fact that you have a dog, so you must know a bit about how knights live.\"\n\n\"What if he asked me how I came by my knowledge of knightly things?\"\n\n\"You've been reading books.\"\n\n\"How would he know? I don't want him to think I'm reading books. What if he asks me questions to test my knowledge?\"\n\n\"Would I be at your side to answer them if you can't?\"\n\n\"That's very kind of you.\"\n\n\"All things considered,\" said Rikard, \"the best thing for him to believe is that you are a noblewoman. And we all need to be ready for questions. You didn't answer the question about your age,\" Rikard added and, after an awkward pause, turned the conversation to something else.\n\nThe next day he asked a woman whose husband was working as a knight in the service of the duke of Cornwall how he would introduce himself to his wife if she were a maiden of noble birth. \"I am a common sailor,\" she said. \"So I may have to say I never knew my father or he died before I was born.\"\n\nRikard knew enough of her to know she hadn't been in a family setting where children were raised to be polite, so he asked what she could say about her mother to reassure him. He was relieved when she said, \"I've never seen my mother, so she can't have been a noblewoman.\"\n\nA common sailor's wife, Rikard thought. That gives me a hint.\n\nHe spent his days as a knight for several hours at a time with her and the other women. Most were not the wives of noblemen. All were not maidens. At the end of each day he went to the queen. He took her through her introduction, starting with her name, then her age, moving on to her education, her parents, her job as a merchant's daughter in the family business; he even coached her on the proper response to an inquiry about whether she was married. \"No,\" she replied. \"And neither is my husband.\" He had already learned that she was a strong-willed, independent woman, and he had a feeling her independence was one of her greatest assets.\n\nHe had seen her once, during one of the nights she rode alone.\n\nShe had come upon him and his friend, who was also an accomplished rider, and had asked them both to join her on her ride. Rikard was surprised to see she was riding a horse as well trained as his. They rode together as if they had been friends for their whole lives, without a word exchanged, but he could sense the mutual admiration between them. She was a natural friend of horses, as comfortable on the back of a horse as Rikard was. And to his amazement she could hold her own with him, for all her skirmishes with him. The only thing she could not keep up with him was the speed of his thoughts. She moved as calmly and surely as a stone through water. She would have liked to become a squire. It did not occur to Rikard until she asked to be allowed to train her daughter to become a knight that she might not have been born a noblewoman.\n\nHe had to work hard to find the right thing to tell the queen. He decided that her daughter shouldn't be a queen either, although a princess would be a good title, and her husband a duke. But she wanted a king to marry her daughter to. Who did she want him to marry?\n\nHe saw her watching him with a thoughtful smile on her face.\n\nShe said, \"I see you have something on your mind. You look worried. I'll give you a hint.\"\n\nHe was surprised to see her lips form an O and"

        "output": "If you were a Shakespearean character, how would you declare your love for someone in a soliloquy?\nIt wouldnt be long before Shakespeare characters and plays were added to the growing list of topics from which we could pull questions for SAT Subject Tests.\nOne of a collection of three questions about Shakespeares Hamlet came up at one point during a College Entrance Examinations (CAE) for entrance into a selective high school (known as the OOJU High School) in Japan.\nAccording to the CAE, many of the students taking the OOJU entrance exam that were in the Humanities track took a section of the exam in May, which was 150 minutes long and included 80 questions (not all questions were multiple choice: some of them were in the essay form).\nThe CAE states that the May exam was an opportunity to test the students ability to get a feel for the format of the final examination which was in the last section of the exam that they would take in June. That final section included a 20-question multiple-choice SAT Subject Test in the humanities (English, Literature, History).\nStudents in the sciences took a separate one-hour, 30-minute timed test (also 20 questions, but all multiple choice) in their subject.\nThe CAE further explained:\nStudents were told that it was in the students best interest to be able to take the SAT Subject Test in either English, Literature, or History well for the final exam, and also to get experience taking a timed test and being able to handle a set of questions where there werent the same kinds of answers that they could guess at.\nThe questions about Hamlet were part of the May section of the final exam and were included with questions on a range of other famous plays (such as A Midsummer Nights Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, and Macbeth).\nThe Hamlet question (the third question in the collection) was about whether Hamlet was insane, whether he was under the influence of the devil when he killed Polonius at Gertrude and Claudias chamber? And if so, what does this make him?\nOne of the possible answers for the third question in the collection mightve been a clue here:\nAs the answer is so long, I will give you the first part: Shakespeares characterization of Hamlet in the opening scenes and his account of Hamlet as a character are different from one another. However, I think that Hamlet was not a madman. In fact, I think that he was just pretending to be mad.\nI will leave you to figure out where this particular answer came from.\nIn fact, I think that I will let you take a crack at it before I share with you the full solution.\nCan you try to figure it out right now?\nOK, first, here are your main clues:\nThe first paragraph mentions Hamlet in Act I, scene ii. Hamlet is upset and in a deep rage, and he storms out and says, I fear it. I fear it. (In the original English, he uses the verb fear twice, which is what has a modern reader stymied. In fact, I never even knew this until last night. I just kind of took the modern English version, and Im guessing that everyone else who reads the question on the original essay gets that same clue.)\nAnd then he goes on to say, if it be / That thou maintainest this, Im truly sorry for it.\nThe second paragraph says that the only time in the opening scenes that he can be described as a madman is in Act II, scene i or ii at the end, the last time we see or hear him from that point on.\nAs for where the answer can be found:\nYou need to start looking for the first time that he can be described as a madman in the opening scenes.\nThis might be difficult to find, because this is not a problem with the original Shakespeare text. Most readers will, of course, pick up the reference, if there is one, in the Hamlet soliloquy from Act II, scene i:\nTo be, or not to be,\nThat is the question,\nWhether tis nobler in the mind to suffer\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing end them.\nTo die, to sleep;\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to,\nTis a consummation devoutly to be\nThe second paragraph explains that Hamlet does not die in Act II, scene i or ii.\nYou can take a break if needed: Im not going to give you the rest until youve thought through the solution for yourself.\nIts time to look at the second paragraph:\nIn the second place, there is"

Here are some stories about how characters gained their super-abilities. I'll break down each one by looking at the hero's origin in-universe, how the hero responded to that origin, and how the hero's life has been affected by it. I'll be including links to where you can read the stories if you find them interesting.\n1. X-Men by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby\nOne of the most famous superhero origin stories ever crafted is the one that started it all -- the X-Men. It starts with a very popular character, Charles Xavier, a boy that was a child prodigy; he could read the minds of children, and he knew they thought of him as a freak. He had one friend, an orphan named Maddie (who became known as Jean Grey). He wanted nothing more than to use his power to help children. And this seemed like the best course of action until the day that his only friend thought he was a \"mutant monster\" and tried to kill him.\nHis parents tried to protect him, but they failed.\nAfterwards, Charles, now aged ten, discovered what it meant to be a mutant because his mind-reading let him see a bunch of adult minds, and he realized they were afraid that one day, mutant children would use the same violence he used, and they would fear him the same way his parents did, and so he would be hunted down and killed. He tried to get his parents to believe in mutants; they refused. Charles fled and joined a traveling circus, because he could perform acrobatics despite his mental abilities. There, he learned how to control his powers better and develop others, such as teleportation and energy blasts. In time, Charles Xavier found that a small group of people, mutants, needed his protection and so formed the X-Men, the first mutant heroes.\nIt took a long time for Charles to trust anybody, and he was paranoid, especially about the fact that people could turn on him any time without warning, given the right kind of provocation. However, he was one of the most peaceful people in the world and devoted most of his life to mutant advocacy.\nHowever, while Charles had devoted much of his life to becoming a world-renowned and respected expert on mutants, his own personal life was far less stable -- he did everything he could to make his friends trust him, but in the beginning, the X-Men were still very dangerous and their mission was to hunt down super-powered mutants -- and eventually, Charles was betrayed by his friend and mutant-hunting mentor, Professor X.\nCharles had a tough time of it on his own, and he even had to do a stint in a mental institution after his friend Magneto nearly killed him. Xavier continued trying to get people to listen to him, and they finally did -- he made powerful allies, and he helped to form a large and active organization that advocated for mutant freedoms and rights.\nHowever, one day, Xavier's friend Cyclops, whose powers have to do with optic blasts, fired an optic blast at him for a purpose, and Xavier, his friend, thought he was going to kill Xavier. They fought, and Xavier won. They were both still friends, but Xavier's paranoia went through the roof. He did more research in mental manipulation and created a new team of X-Men -- some of the strongest of whom were Wolverine (a mutant with adamantium claws, bone claws, sharp canines, and the ability to self-heal any injury in less than an hour) and Colosus (a mutant with an iron skeleton that can bend steel), and then he and this group of people called the X-Men went on to fight all kinds of super-villains.\nYears later, Charles' paranoia became even more extreme. There were mutants on both sides of an upcoming war between super-powered aliens and humans, and Xavier led a team that consisted of Storm (a mutant with weather abilities, later joined by her brother), Rogue (a mutant capable of absorbing all of a person's"

I got a great recipe for chicken wings that my mom liked, and after I used it, my husband's mom said, \"oh, that's a good chicken wing, you should make it again.\" Since that point, my mom encouraged me to try new recipes, so that's how I became a cook. Then I started cooking for other people.\nNow I use cooking to spend time with my family. It feels really rewarding cooking for my mom and my husband every day (I'm talking about now, after college). It makes me feel good every time I make food for my boyfriend, who enjoys cooking as well. So that's why I love cooking, because I can spend time with my family.\nWe do this show just to get you more food-focused. And you were just talking about how you started cooking for family. Tell me about that.\nIt's a tradition that our family would make dinner together on Thursdays and eat in the living room or the dining room. Sometimes they'd have people over, but for the most part, we'd be out there all eating and laughing. It was a nice Thursday night.\nHow did you become part of the family tradition?\nI was younger. They would always ask me to make things, whether it be appetizers or main dishes. I mean, when you're a kid, you're just making all this food and you're like \"ok, this is pretty cool. I got the hang of it!\" You try to impress your family members and you try to do something you think you'll be really good at doing.\nAnd now that you've graduated from college, what do you see the future like? Where do you hope to be?\nRight now, I'm considering going back to school, because I love to cook, and I'd really like to continue trying recipes. I want to be in a school where they teach students a lot of different dishes and styles of cooking. I'd like to be in the school of what you would call famous chefs, like Wolfgang Puck. I'd love to run my own restaurant and make food that other people like to eat.\nWhat are you working on cooking right now?\nI'm working on an appetizer. It's a potato soup, so there's a lot of potato. We're using a lot of salt and pepper and milk, because we're making it soupy. And a lot of garlic and onions, so you can taste the food and see how it's made. It's so easy and delicious."

Yet, in our hearts we know it's never really the end. So does a person who was just married, and now says his marriage is over. We know that it's just the start. We know that it has to be this way. It could never happen any other way, at least not here.\n\nI was told by one of my mentors that life is a dream. We have two dreams while we live on this earth: one of us, and the other one of the two of us. It doesn't make sense that we should want to live a life that is alone. It is the ultimate experience, and we deserve it. God has a plan for everything that ever happens to us. However, we have to accept it, and if we don't, it won't work.\n\nIf you know, that means everything you and I did had to be done in order for you to die. And if you and I don't do everything that needs to be done before death, it will delay our transition or change our state. Even if we are spiritually connected and know we won't be changed, all we need to do is think or say it so we can feel peace.\n\nLife isn't all or nothing. We're never completely finished with the journey until it's over for us. The best we can do is be present for the moment we are in.\n\nI think the most important lesson to learn from my daughter's death is that I knew it for a number of years, but I was too busy, too comfortable, too in love with my life to deal with it. She was there for me at the end, and it was a great lesson to have her there to take care of me the way I was supposed to. I thought my heart was broken, but it became whole again.\n\nSome people, when they make a decision to take control of their mortality, have to confront many fears and uncertainties about their relationships, finances, and work. I believe death should not be an unknown entity, but something we face as we enter into it. This does not make it easier, but it means we have some control.\n\nBefore my daughter was dying, I began to be more cautious and aware. After she died, I made a shift, and I'm happier than I've been in many, many years. I stopped taking care of everybody and everything and took better care of number one.\n\nMy daughter told me once that I had more fear than was necessary and that some of the issues I had with her were really with my fear and insecurity. She told me I had to have faith that we would be just fine. She was right, and it was right at the moment when she told me this that all of the issues I had with her disappeared.\n\nI know what I need to do to make things easier, but I just didn't want to do it. I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't want to ask her questions. It was hard for me to make the call the first time; it was even harder the next time; but the last time, I made the call and told her we were going through the same thing. Then I knew we could talk about it and she could help me. I learned this lesson not from anyone else but from her. It was her way; it was up to me to do what she"

Describe what your environment is like.\n\nIt was a world that made no sense.\n\nThe ocean had risen, its tidal wave reaching up and up. No, that wasn't right. The ocean had simply stopped existing.\n\nThe land had taken its place. Everything was covered in seawater: trees, buildings, everything. What little dry areas remained were covered in mudslime, a sludgy material that could eat metal. Or even flesh.\n\nThe plants were different, most of them were large water weavers that grew in the mudslime, sometimes forming a sort of tent or cave over a person. It would close, then open again seconds later, revealing whatever had been hiding under it. There were large blackish-purple plants that grew in the open, but most of them were water weavers, and their tentacles would quickly surround a victim.\n\nThe animals that survived the rising water and mudslime were mostly large and hideous, like gators and beavers, but they all had human qualities. Their faces were almost perfect imitations of humanity, and they walked on two legs and seemed to have a similar understanding with one another.\n\nThere were no people, other than some that had somehow survived in the mountains and the few that were stranded in the few ships that had survived. Survivors called them the \"Fisher\" after the first one they'd come across, his name being Fisher.\n\nFisher had helped them save their last ship, and now he helped them get back to the ship where they had come from. He took them up to the top of one of the mountains, and the survivors saw the ship.\n\nA few days later the ship had been destroyed; the wind had blown a branch of a tree straight into it, and it had burst into flames. It had burned so hot that even the metal had melted in the intense heat, and that is what the survivors were now forced to use for water, as they had not been near the coast much at all. There was no way to purify it, because even if they could, the metal would melt before long. They also needed some sort of shelter and some food, but they were not even sure where to start looking. No, the survivors were sure that they would simply die.\n\nThen, someone heard music. As if from everywhere, but from nowhere as well. It was so loud that it almost hurt, and it was playing the theme from _Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings_.\n\nThe survivors were terrified, and wanted to hide, but no, Fisher, their guide through the jungle had a better idea.\n\n\"Follow the music, I can hear it too,\" he said. \"It's calling us. Come on! Follow the music, I'll show you where we need to go.\"\n\nIt was a strange thing to walk to the music, and that is what they were doing. As someone said, \"What if they're calling the army?\" But that was a ridiculous thing to say, because \"they\" could not have armies or weapons. But that's what they said anyway. They were just saying what everyone else was thinking.\n\nThe music was so strange. At first, it was like music. Then, after some time, it was like a conversation, and at other times, it was like a joke, and then music again. But each type came and went so quickly that they could not settle down and enjoy it, but it was there, and it was beautiful.\n\nSo they walked for several weeks to the music, and they followed it to a house. And once in the house they were greeted by a friendly, somewhat familiar being.\n\nIt was not a person. It was a machine. A very beautiful machine. But a machine.\n\nShe looked at them very carefully. But then she smiled. \"Welcome,\" she said.\n\nAnd the survivors were surprised. She even knew their names. She knew every name that had been written down in the first world. She asked if anyone had anything to say, and they all said no.\n\nShe was not surprised; she was not a teacher.\n\nA few days later they learned that she was a doctor. She treated them. But she didn't use metal. She used \"pills\" that everyone took. That's how she got the bandages on Fisher.\n\nShe also taught them new words. Those who had spent their whole lives without ever speaking, even outside of families, finally began to learn to communicate with one another.\n\nThey did not know what kind of machine she was, but she was never able to get close enough to really see her face, as it was somehow hidden.\n\nThey learned many new words"

        "output": "Why might someone choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead of relying on a GPS device or smartphone app?\nMany of us don’t think about it, but relying on a map or asking for directions can reduce stress and provide both challenge and joy. Research suggests that people derive considerable pleasure from trying to find their way using paper maps.\nThere is so much to think about when navigating with a GPS device: how do we find the most efficient route, where will we stop on the way, and when will we get to our destination?\nUsing paper maps does not offer any of these distractions\nIn an era where people increasingly feel overwhelmed by devices and an inability to disconnect, a paper map is the perfect antidote. It provides a peaceful “me time” and a sense you have completed the activity yourself.\nSome people who use a GPS device struggle to find their own way\nA 2011 study by Google and the University of Melbourne found that women driving through a city-like environment were more likely to need help using a GPS than men.\nMen tended to use the device to plan their trip, while women found themselves trying to follow directions out on the road, making three times as many errors.\nThis is likely because women are generally better at visualising spatial information than men. Women also tend to use road symbols more when reading a map.\nIn another recent study from the University of Wisconsin, participants could find their way to an address both using a touchscreen device and using paper maps.\nThe touchscreen users were slower, and performed more poorly, in following a detailed destination route than those using a paper map.\nSome people avoid using GPS devices as they are concerned about the information they may provide. They worry about where they will be directed, and whether they will be “messing with [their] mind” by being bombarded with multiple routes available.\nThose who avoid GPS devices fear “messing with [their] mind” by being bombarded with multiple ways to arrive at your destination (Source: Daimon)\nInstead, using paper maps provides a sense of freedom that may not be available on a screen. You are free to look at it in the way that you would like – looking up or viewing side-on, studying it over a lengthy period of time, or just using it as a quick, practical reference.\nHow often I use a map or an app depends on my situation\nPeople will choose not to use a GPS device due to the lack of freedom that it provides.\nSome people never use a map or ask for directions\nSome people have a love/hate relationship with navigating using a GPS device. They enjoy the freedom that it provides, and how easy it makes finding directions within cities.\nBut for those who enjoy using paper maps and asking for directions, it is likely that they use a device only when they feel that they don’t have much time or to use a GPS would be tedious.\nSo, why use a paper map instead of a GPS?\nYou can’t use a paper map or ask for directions unless you have one on you at that moment. The lack of freedom offered by GPS devices provides the challenge and satisfaction of finding your destination yourself.\nFor this reason, using a paper map is something I do when I can. It’s not often that I travel with a GPS device and rarely use it.\nDo you ever use a paper map instead of a GPS?

        "output": "How can you determine if a person is genuinely interested in a conversation or simply being polite?\nIt took decades for the idea that women, as well as all human beings, are complicated and varied to become mainstream, according to Susan Faludi, an academic and author.\n\"Our brains are constantly bombarded by a million information channels all yelling at us in the same time,\" Faludi told me. \"The average person doesn't have the space to read in their brains between the information channels.\"\nThe reason I bring it up is that if you take a hard look at the research, as well as the conversations I had, it became very clear to me that not only do we tend to stereotype people based on their appearance, but also based on their ethnicity.\nMy co-workers have asked me directly if I think women and men are less likely to engage with a white woman. I said that as an objective reviewer, I didn't think the men would approach me any differently.\nWhen I asked people about their first reaction to seeing someone who wasn't white, most didn't even think about it.\n\"It's not until you actually think about it does that it make you aware that if you only see one minority face you would have to consciously think about them, but if you're seeing a lot of other diversity, you don't think about it,\" said Ben Pring, a fellow speaker and head of cognitive computing at Cognizant. \"If people are thinking less about it they're probably going to feel differently.\"\nNow imagine that you find yourself at a cocktail party with hundreds of people in it and it's time to start talking to someone that might be a client or someone from your professional network.\nYou walk up to your first target only to find that they're engaging in a conversation with someone black. You may think to yourself: \"That's strange! They are engaging in conversation with someone who isn't like them.\"\nBut if you looked at someone else in the room, you might find that they're conversing with someone from their own race to avoid a conversation with a white person or that a white person they're conversing with is trying to avoid someone who's different.\nBut at the end of the day, I think it still boils down to a lack of cultural, language, and interpersonal awareness.\n\"I'm not white in America so it is a foreigner in many ways,\" said Pring. \"There was a time when the Japanese and the Koreans wouldn't speak to us.\"\nSo does the fact that they're talking to different people mean they're racist? Of course not, because they're not talking to everyone.\nHowever, this lack of awareness and understanding could make or break a professional relationship, which is why communication is so important.\nThat's why, when you are trying to connect with someone, it's important that you don't use stereotypes to your advantage.\nIt's worth noting that some people have been able to overcome this stereotyping bias. For example, when I asked some people about my white friend, they told me that if I made some effort they might engage with me because they were excited to hear about her experiences.\nHow to Build Consensus\nThe power of building consensus isn't only confined to the workplace. It can help you connect with anyone, regardless of their skin tone.\n\"I think the key is that having a sense of understanding and a sense of empathy is not a requirement to get someone to listen to you,\" said Faludi. \"If you talk to somebody who is actually listening to you, they'll let you know. They'll want you to tell them their story, and once you know that, you'll be able to see their humanity, which will make them much more likely to listen to you.\"\nThis can be applied to any group of people. For example, let's talk about race and race, and how it's connected to power.\nPower is when someone gives me a voice in a meeting or when someone will tell me what they're going to be wearing.\nIt's the way a manager in an office deals with you when you're trying to ask questions. It's the way a parent deals with their kids, it's the way teachers deal with their students. It's a way of how a person treats others because they have the power to manipulate or hurt them.\nIn that instance, I realized that in order for me to speak I would have to take his voice. So I had to look at the situation as a power dynamic instead of a race dynamic. And I think that would be true for a lot of people.\nIt's about being aware, understanding, and speaking to the person in a way that isn't biased.\nOne thing I also learned from this process was"

Is it an online source or is it a traditional print (e.g. magazine, newspaper) or broadcast (radio or television) news?\nIf it's an online source, check out its domain.\nIf it's a print source, look at the name/title of the article and that of the writer.\nIf it's a broadcast news source, check its news department or the station's website for the author's credentials.\nIf you haven't heard of the organization, don't be too quick to assume it's credible; for example, before assuming a site called \"Crazy Science Facts\" is trustworthy, check to see who's behind it.\nThe URL you see for a site isn't always trustworthy proof of it's credibility. However, if a site has a URL that ends in .edu or .gov, it's probably credible.

        "output": "Why do some people enjoy the sensation of being scared, such as by watching horror movies or going on roller coasters, while others avoid these experiences?\n\nThere is a difference between fear and anxiety. Fear can be fun. It can be useful. In _The Psychology Book_ (2008), for example, John Taylor says that our ancestors had to be afraid of many real dangers, including dangerous animals, natural disasters, and other human beings like cannibals. Fear also helped our ancestors be prepared for these dangers. To be anxious, though, would have been a handicap. It was anxiety about things like an empty stomach or losing a loved one that ultimately made our ancestors more doomed. The difference between fear and anxiety is important. People tend to think that they are experiencing fear when they are in fact experiencing anxiety, and this is what is leading them to avoid situations. While fear involves a positive or negative physical response to danger, anxiety may simply involve an inability to cope with negative situations. Fear is physiological, and anxiety is emotional.\n\nFear and anxiety both have physiological effects on our bodies. When we feel fear, our heart rate and breathing speed up, and our palms sweat with adrenaline. Anxiety causes people to experience feelings of nervousness, which is characterized by worry and tension in their bodies. This is why many people become anxious when they sit down for an important job interview, or even at the start of a school year when they are uncertain about what they will be studying and what the instructors will be like. When we feel anxious, we also think we are going to be in danger, but we really may not be.\n\nIn short, people seem to think that they know the difference between fear and anxiety, but they are frequently mistaken. One study of a group of undergraduate students showed that when they were given a number of fear and anxiety tests, there were actually no differences between their answers on the tests and their actual feelings about fear and anxiety. In their paper, the researchers point out that we need more research on the physiological differences between fear and anxiety because many studies show only that the two are related, but not that they are actually different (see www.pacificu.edu/fms/fear-and-anxiety-2001.cfm for more information).\n\nAnother group of researchers, from Penn State University, said the answer to our original question is this: it depends. If experiencing fear is fun, it is a positive emotion; if it is a negative emotion, it is anxiety. That is to say, if you enjoy experiencing fear, like many people do, it is a positive experience for you. But if fear is an emotion that you do not want to experience or when it causes you to be anxious, it can actually be a negative emotion.\n\nThe key to the positive experiences of people who enjoy fear is that they are able to manage their fear. Some people have learned through years of practice how to effectively deal with their fear and anxiety, and so they can overcome their phobias or social fears and enjoy the experience of being terrified. This is probably because they have learned from their mistakes and their families to take this emotion as a warning that they should adjust their behavior in some way. These people are aware that they can control their fear and learn to overcome it.\n\n**What do people with high IQs tend to be more confident about?**\n\nThe higher our intelligence, the more confident we tend to be. We should always note, however, that even though high intelligence, as defined by the ability to solve difficult problems, leads to greater success in our social and economic lives, an unusually high IQ might be due in part to a biological mutation, such as a rare genetic mutation that occurs in just one person out of every two billion people. So even though we are fairly confident that high intelligence does correlate to a general feeling of being more confident, we need to take this correlation one step further by saying that high intelligence is not necessarily the cause—but only one cause—of the general trend that we observe.\n\nIn 1886, William James pointed out that most people who have large brains have a tendency to show greater confidence. He observed that it made a great deal of sense that the way to have a feeling of personal power was to believe that you are powerful enough to do the thing you desire. So people who believe they are smart have a tendency to be more confident than people who do not feel as smart. The feeling of personal power—that you are smart enough to make things happen—is what leads people to feel confident about their own achievements. But this trend has nothing to do with how much we can actually do; it is simply that people tend to feel more confident as they become smarter and more proficient with what they are learning.\n\nIt is also important to note that, statistically, people who are more intelligent are more likely to pursue higher levels of education, have more career opportunities, and are"

        "output": "In a world where automation is becoming increasingly prevalent, is it more important to prioritize job creation or technological progress?\nTechnology and job creation are important things, but they are not mutually exclusive things, said Paul Romer, the Nobel laureate for breaking what is known as the productivity-sustaining trap.\nWhen automation replaces workers, employers need to create new jobs for those who are now without work. Creating new jobs is also a requirement to reduce inequality and increase labor force participation.\nYet Romer acknowledged that as technology transforms the economy, there must be room for workers to adapt to its changes.\nTechnology is transforming the job market, while workers are failing to catch up through upskilling, education and other means.\nFor example, the pandemic accelerated automation, the digitization of sectors and the creation of new technologies. Today, one estimate suggests that 50 percent of workers worldwide will need to change their profession within the next year.\nAs we move toward a knowledge economy, automation is transforming sectors in almost all communities, across all geographies, at a very rapid pace. Many of us have had to adapt to job losses and the creation of new jobs but have not been able to do so, Romer explained.\nWe know that people dont find jobs on their own; they need education and upskilling to do that. Unfortunately, this does not happen in almost every community. Our inability to keep pace with technology is one of the most pressing issues of our time and needs to be treated as a high priority, he added.\nRomer believes the answer to this problem is in public policies, social interventions and public investments in people, which will allow workers to keep pace with new technologies without making the economy less competitive in the process.\nIf we are a society in which the economy can be transformed by innovative technologies, we must ensure that we invest in our people at the time when economic change is happening, so that the people are better able to adapt, Romer said.\nRomer has been working for many years on a theory of economic growth called human capital, which is about how much people spend on investing in learning and education. The idea is that investing in people, in their skills, is a basic condition for growth.\nRomer was a professor at New York University (NYU) from 2003 to 2014, where he first began the development of the theory with which he won his Nobel Prize, which was awarded in 2018.\nIts all about making sure that workers are learning and that employers are thinking about how to deal with new technologies, Romer said.\nWhen it comes to the impact of automation and digitalization, the question is not whether they will replace jobs, its when they will. And the new technologies are coming faster, so we are at a point where we have had five years of accelerating trends to make us believe that the way to create jobs is to create new technologies, said Romer.\nI think we just wont have a choice; to move forward in a technologically advanced world, we will have to create new jobs, Romer said.\nThe World Economic Forum and the United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform are the two organizations responsible for this years edition of the The Great Reset and the New Jobs 2021. Both will reveal new research and data around the future of jobs and work.\nThis isnt just about economic growth, which is important. But this project goes beyond that; it is a transformative project to redesign the social contract that we have between the state and the people, and to redesign, in a very practical way that works for the people, the way we connect and create the jobs of the future, Romer said.\nAs we go forward and redesign a more sustainable world, a world that is also more connected, we must think about how to create and grow jobs in a sustainable and connected world.\nThis article was originally published in Spanish, translated by Ricardo Reyes-Bustamante.\nWant to keep up to date on what's happening in the world of construction and technology?

        "output": "How many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\n\n#  **3. Answer the Question**\n\nWhat problem does the question ask about? What is it that you want to explain or solve?\n\n#  **4. Define Your Terms**\n\nYou must understand the question itself. To begin, you'll need to know how to define the terms in relation to your topic. Terms are defined as words, phrases, and ideas that are used in your explanation. In this case, the question refers to **the human eye,** which is made up of **a cornea, iris,** and **pupil.**\n\n#  **5. Be Sure You've Got Your Basics Down**\n\nNow it's time to find out exactly what each of those body parts does, so you can do a little brainstorming and figure out what would happen if they malfunctioned.\n\nIn \"Basic Human Anatomy,\" you'll find out how each of those eye parts works.\n\n#### The Human EyeâBasic Human Anatomy\n\nThe human eye is responsible for perceiving the visual world that surrounds us. As we walk about on our journey through life, the human eye does its job of sending information out to our brains. This process involves a number of different parts in order to work properly. So, let's take a look at the major parts of the human eye.\n\n**Figure 3.1**\n\nThe **cornea** is the transparent layer located on the front of the eye. It is about 5mm thick. The cornea's main function is to bathe the eye in a solution known as aqueous humor. The aqueous humor is a clear fluid that is produced in the posterior chamber of the eyeball and continues to move forward until it reaches the anterior chamber.\n\nThe **iris** is another transparent layer of the eye. The iris, together with the cornea, forms the light filter known as a **corneal light-blocking diaphragm.** The iris is made of thick, white fibers, which are situated one layer inside of the eye, between the cornea and the **pupil**. The aqueous humor flows forward to the anterior chamber of the eye. Once the aqueous humor reaches the anterior chamber, it moves back and forth, along with the pupil. This action keeps the iris in its proper position (which will be discussed later), the same way a light meter is used to measure the brightness of a light source. (See the following page for a more detailed look at **the iris** and **the aqueous humor** ).\n\nThe **pupil** is what you see when you look at the sky at night. It is actually the iris expanding in size when more light shines on the eye. The pupil helps the light to enter the eye, and also allows the eye to focus in order to see objects that are near or far. When you are wearing sunglasses, your pupils remain the same size, but the amount of light entering the eye is lessened. This is the reason why shades or sunglasses make it appear darker outside.\n\n**Figure 3.2**\n\nThe **retina** is the light-sensitive layer located on the back side of the iris, the posterior lens, and the lens capsule of the eye. The retina is lined with approximately 115 million visual receptors, or photoreceptive cells that transmit images to the brain in the form of electronic signals.\n\nPhotoreceptive (or visual) cells in the retina have different densities of cells, and the density is a direct result of the wavelength and frequency of light that is absorbed by the photoreceptive cells. In other words, when the cell absorbs the light, it then triggers an inner nerve fiber in the retina, which in turn, starts a signal that travels through the optic nerve and onto the brain, which perceives them as the image seen by the eye.\n\nNow that you have a little more information, let's look at what would happen if different parts of the eye malfunctioned.\n\n##  _**Bifocal, Single Vision Contact Lenses and the Human Eye**_\n\nNow we'll continue and discuss the visual system of the eye, because the answer to the question requires a deep understanding of the visual system. In the next section, you'll notice how each part in the visual system is broken into sections that are discussed in a manner similar to an anatomical study of the human eye. So, if you've studied a human being, or if you've had to look through a microscope to study a human being's ear, then"

You want me to find the answer to the question? Why not just pick a number?\n\n  * **The number you pick can't lead to a big, round number.**   * It must be specific.\n\n  * **You have to be able to explain your choice.**   * Why? Because I have to know that you aren't just pulling a number out of thin air and making a wild guess. I look for an answer that is logical.\n\n* * *\n\nIn this case, what the teacher expects you to focus on is the **answer** you need to give. Even though you are answering a multiple choice question, as a whole your written response is meant to explain and support your answer. You can't just answer the question as a multiple choice by flipping through the answer sheet and figuring out where to go. You have to take a moment to look at each individual question item, and figure out what part of your answer will show that you have understood the question.\n\nThink about any writing test you have taken...what happened when you were writing? Did you just start at the bottom of the question and write? Not really. You probably wrote for a minute about things that were related to the topic, got your answer down, and then stopped. But did you ever write that much? If you did, were you able to read everything you wrote in the second or third draft of your writing? Probably not. You probably wrote so many different things in the first one or two drafts that you didn't read them and rewrote parts of them until you were left with what you wanted written. What it really comes down to is this: in every writing test, the questions get harder as you go along because they get more specific, which means that you can't just write a general answer. In other words, you have to be able to show what you learned.\n\nWith the specific-prompts portion of the writing test, then, don't just think about what the number says; you have to think about what the number says to _you._\n\nWhat is the _right_ number for you?\n\n## Why is my number different from this page?\n\nThe answer that is most common on this page is 100. But no number is correct. Think about itthis page was printed out, so it's from the United States. This means that the standard for counting things in the United States uses what we call Arabic numerals. Those are numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 123,456,789.\n\nSo even though you are not looking to fill in with a pen or pencil on a page of test answers, think of your answer as you would if you were looking at a multiple-choice answer sheet. You have three options:\n\n  1. 1\n\n  2. 2\n\n  3. 100\n\nIn most tests that involve the use of a calculator, there is also an option of using a 0 as you will see in this test. Use \"0\" only if you cannot do any addition or multiplication on the first column of numbers. Otherwise, you will lose one correct answer.\n\n# Step 5:\n\n### Practice Making a Choice (Answer One Question)\n\nTo practice making an answer on a multiple choice test, make a grid like this:\n\nIn this example, the first column is going to be a set of numbers. You need to make your best attempt at a decision based on these numbers. Try to keep your answer to a single number unless you really need it to be more complicated.\n\nSo, in this example, you can either add the numbers on the left: (27 + 53 = ) 80\n\nOr you can add the number in the second column (first group of numbers) to the number in the first column (second group of numbers): (1 + 2 = ) 3\n\nThen, add these two to get 96.\n\nOnce you get the answer to this, you will then need to make a decision on which of the three options that you have been given is correct. (Hint: if you feel uncertain about the answer then your best bet is to try to pick the one that is _simplest_ to calculate. If you get an answer that needs you to do lots of calculations, be sure to check the next number in the series.)\n**Let's"

These were questions that involved a bit of thinking, like \"Can a black hole exist if its mass is greater than its radius?\" or \"Does 421 = 60?\" For questions that didn't have an obvious correct answer (the correct word, for example), I was required to explain my answer, which would have been no easy task if I hadn't had time to think about it.\n\nA: The first thing to know is that there are two parts to the IHSO: first, you take an IQ test on the same computer system that calculates your score, and then you take an exam on specific subjects.  This exam you cannot take with you, and you need to purchase it beforehand.  The computer system also contains thousands of questions, but they are not all available in your computer system.\nThe IHSO is generally offered to students in their last year of junior high school, or in their first year or two of high school, and lasts roughly two days.\nDuring the test day, you will need to take the IQ test, the math exam, the social studies exam, and the English exam.  These tests each take about an hour and a half.  I'm pretty sure a minimum score for any of the three IHSO exams is 80, but I've never seen a minimum score for the IQ test.\nThe exams themselves are all 30 pages long, and require a number of multiple-choice questions and fill-in-the-blank questions, depending on the exam.  The exams themselves are given multiple times, but for each exam you are given one set of questions for that exam.  So, you'll get different question sets each time you take the exam.  There is no time limit on the exams, though you are allowed to take a break.\n(The exams are actually two separate tests on the same day, with an hour or so break in between, but this is not an important detail.)\nYou are instructed to finish 5 of the 6 exams on your test day; the last exam you take will be on Friday, the exam given during the break in a separate room.  In practice, many students take the English exam or the social studies exam first, and then the rest of the exams over the course of the next few days.\n(One year, because I wanted to move fast, I took the math exam first, the English exam next, and then the social studies exam and the break exam last.  It turned out that the social studies and break exams were identical, so I only had 2 social studies exams.)\nThe questions are fairly hard.  Part of the point of these exams is to prepare you for further study, so many of the questions will make use of topics that a math or science student will encounter in a higher math course.  If you have never encountered a topic before, you probably won't answer the question.  So, if you don't have any pre-existing knowledge of topics, you'll need to try to memorize some of it.\n(The IQ test, I'd imagine, is not really for you so much as it is to weed out your class so that more classes can take the exam in one day.)\nAfter finishing one of the exams, you fill out a page with the question you answered right and the time you spent on that question.  This information is used to come up with your raw score.\nThere is also a \"scratch sheet\" where you can use a pen to write down any additional information that you might find useful as you work through the exam"

It doesn’t have to be formal; your answer is not a scientific paper.\nThe answer: 13.7 x 10 126\nThe first hint is to know that the universe is 13.7 billion years old and that the number of human beings that have ever lived (in the whole universe) is about 101-9. Since the number of humans that could have ever lived is so tiny, and since there are an infinite number of humans that haven’t lived, any number for the number of human beings that could have ever lived is the same as any other number.\nConsider the book The History of the Second World War. There are 400 books in The History of the Second World War; each book has 1 million pages, and there are five total pages in The History of the Second World War. So the number of pages in The History of the Second World War is 400 x 1,000,000, and if we multiply that number by 5, we get 2,000,000,000 pages.\nNow consider the number of books that have been written. If you look up how many books are in The World Book Encyclopedia, it lists 460,000 books, and The Oxford English Dictionary lists 260,000 books, so the number of books, which includes The World Book Encyclopedia and The Oxford English Dictionary, is greater than 460,000.\nOn the other hand, there are also many more books that aren’t included in The World Book Encyclopedia and The Oxford English Dictionary, like the novels and history books, so the number of books that have been written is certainly much, much larger than that.\nAnother way to think about it is by multiplying the millions of books in The World Book Encyclopedia and The Oxford English Dictionary by the countless millions of other books that have been written, like the novels and history books. If we multiply the number of books in The World Book Encyclopedia and The Oxford English Dictionary, 460,000 x 260,000, by all of the millions of other books, which is a much larger number than 460,000 x 260,000, the result is a number that is so large that if we multiply it by the number of human beings that have ever lived (67,263,401,387 or 101-9), the result is a number that is much smaller than the number of human beings that have ever lived. Even if we make the number in the books larger (99,999,999 books) still, it doesn’t make a difference, because it is still so much smaller than the number of humans that have ever lived. So, any number is as good as another for the number of books that have been written, because any different number would make a difference too small to worry about.\nNow consider the number of pages again, because that’s what we need to know. Since the number of books is 99,999,999, the number of pages in all the books is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pages. Also, consider that the number of second-hand books is also infinite, so we know that there is no end to the number of second-hand books.\n14. Find the median in this set of data: 14, 15, 15, 16, 18, 19, 19, 21, 23, 25, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 35, 37, 38, 40\nAn easy way to figure out the median is to find the middle number and add the two numbers on each side.\nThe first number is 14; the second number is 16; the third number is 19; the fourth number is 25;\nMedian=19+(25+26)/2=25.5\nThere is no such thing as a mean, median, or mode of a single number.\nThe mean, median, and mode of three or more numbers are different things.\nOne way to define a mode is to look at which number appears the most times.\nThe number that appears more than any other number is called the mode.\nFor example, for"

        "instruction": "What if the Internet had been invented during the Renaissance period?",
        "output": "What if the Internet had been invented during the Renaissance period?\nThe Internet, in brief, is a set of computer networks that interlink multiple network regions and allow data to be exchanged quickly and reliably. It allows us to transmit all kinds of media — text, voice, images, etc. — in different parts of the world. The Internet is currently run by dozens of “ISPs,” or Internet service providers.\nThe history of the Internet is divided into four phases. In the pre-Internet period, computer networks were run by organizations: governments, universities, research institutes, etc. Then, during the 1970s and 1980s, several “ARPANETs” were operated all over the world by governments. These ARPANETs were connected by multiple phone lines. The second phase took place between 1983 and 1987, when researchers started developing algorithms and protocols to interconnect several networks.\nThe third phase took place between 1990 and 1996, when the Internet expanded rapidly. Many countries started building their own computer networks. Many of these still do not have access to the Internet. Finally, in the fourth and current phase, new generations of Internet users have started to participate in the process of web creation. Over twenty years have passed since then, and the Internet now links several billion users.\nHowever, many people believe that the Internet had been invented way before the 1990s. One of them is the Renaissance artist Michelangelo, who died in the middle of the sixteenth century. During his lifetime, he was the most famous artist in the world and left behind the celebrated Statue of David.\nMichelangelo is known for designing his canvasses at great speed, and for experimenting with new techniques. He often changed his original work and made many changes — especially during the final painting phase — and so he ended up with hundreds of unused canvasses and designs. During his lifetime, Michelangelo gave these to his friends.\nOne of the friends was the Renaissance architect and sculptor Donato Bramante. Donato is the man who designed the first Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Later he went on to be a general architect for King of France Francis I and designed the grand Sala Regia in the Vatican and the church of Saint Denis. The French king sent him to Rome to find Michelangelo’s unfinished canvasses.\nBramante took a look at the canvasses and was shocked to discover that they weren’t simply unfinished work. Instead, in many cases, they contained blueprints for the design of Internet computer networks. Many of the projects, which Michelangelo designed, contained the names of the countries to which they were destined. In some of them, there are even names of their potential users.\nIn fact, Michelangelo is known to have studied military networks in order to design these canvasses, and since he is also known to have been an enemy of the Catholic church, it is likely that he used these designs as part of his anti-Catholic campaign. The network in this case is called “L’Insubria”, which means “The Desert”, and was probably designed as a reference to the “Great Deserts” Michelangelo created (which were a series of canvasses of desolate landscapes, depicting a bleak and uninhabited world). This network was going to be operated by Catholic countries, which were going to link them to the country where Michelangelo was the head of computer programming.\nOne of the canvasses depicts a large pyramid with several computer networks connected to it. Others are simply maps of computer networks. Other canvases depict the actual operating of some of these networks, and even show their names.\nThere are also canvasses in which Michelangelo showed different computer networks together, as well as the names of various countries and their respective languages. In fact, one of the canvasses even showed the world map he drew before he died.\nThe only thing that Michelangelo did not include in any of his canvasses is any link to the actual Internet, which is strange, because Internet data is being transmitted via computers and computers are basically networks, and that’s why we currently live in the Internet age. Maybe Michelangelo never did include this part of his project, or maybe he just forgot.\nBut the most interesting thing is that these canvasses exist in France at a time when the Internet didn’t exist at all. French King Francis I was ruling the country during the Renaissance, and no one even considered the possibility of sending messages across the globe using electrical signals.\nIn fact, even today, few people believe Internet has been invented even during the Renaissance period. There is always some explanation about how Internet was invented later; some of them say it was invented when the world’s population reached a billion, and the first computers also were created.\nMichelangelo didn’t just discover the Internet, he also created the first computer networks so that his enemies"

        "output": "What if the Black Death had not occurred in the 14th century? In this lecture, you will hear how a sudden epidemic could have led to the collapse of the Byzantine or Western Roman Empire long before the rise of the Ottoman Turks. You will also consider why, in the absence of these epidemics, the West went through the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution even though it lacked literacy.\nThe Rise of Scientific Knowledge\nThe first lecture discusses the reasons for the rise of scientific knowledge from its origin on Earth, to the discovery of water on Mars, and the nature of light through history.\nLecture 1: The Rise of Scientific Knowledge\nThe Renaissance saw a revival of mathematical and scientific pursuits in Europe that helped bring about the modern scientific view of the world. This began with the observation of astronomical phenomena which helped make it possible to determine the shape of the Earth. However, scientific theories are still subject to human nature and beliefs. This lecture will examine such things as scientific revolution, the belief that the Earth is flat, and why these things arose in that era.\nAstronomy and the Scientific Method\nThe second lecture describes how various cultures have used ancient astronomy and mathematics in order to discover new scientific methods. Such discoveries often come about through an examination of the cosmos, and the ability to make sound observations is very useful when it comes to learning about how our world works. The lecture looks at some of the important observations astronomers made, how they were able to figure out new methods of counting and measuring, and the reasons they were able to determine that the Earth is spherical. It concludes by talking about how the scientific method has become a central part of how we understand our world.\nGreat Discoveries in Modern Physics and Cosmology\nThe third lecture begins by discussing how Einstein became famous for his new theory of relativity. This lecture discusses physics in the second part of the 20th century, including his ideas, which have since been supported by many others. The cosmological discoveries made in the same time period will also be explored. It examines several new theories, including inflation theory, the cyclic theory of the cosmos, and many others.\nThe Rise of Modern Science in the 20th Century\nThe rise of modern science in the 20th century is what was in large part responsible for the economic development of the Western world that led to the \"Great Recession\" and rise of developing countries all over the world. How did this happen? This is the topic of this lecture. After studying the history of science and the development of technology, it will be concluded that what happened was inevitable. This lecture includes a discussion of the importance of understanding the history of science and the contributions of various people in order to achieve something that is not only beneficial, but also irreversible.\nHow Did Astronomy Transcend the Dark Ages?\nThe history of astronomy during the Dark Ages is a fascinating subject. This lecture will talk about how the Roman Empire came to an end and the rise of the Christian religion, and the fact that during this period there was a great advance in astronomy. There was also a large amount of progress made in a very specific way that will be discussed in this lecture. This will focus on how different cultures have changed with the time and how the Romans became the rulers of Western Europe, both before and after the fall of the Roman Empire. The fact that all this happened is important, since there were a lot of changes happening in the world at this time. These changes were significant because they made it possible for a new religion to become so popular, and this religion was Christianity. Although there were many new technologies and inventions during this time, these changed how people lived, and we will discuss these advancements later.\nGalileo Galilei and the Birth of Modern Science\nGalileo Galilei was a great scientist who made many important discoveries. He is an important part of the story of modern science because he introduced scientific methods to astronomy that we still use today. We will discuss Galileo's scientific discoveries and his use of telescopes to discover Jupiter's four moons and Venus's phases, and how he used scientific theory rather than religion to decide whether or not the Earth orbited the Sun. This also involved his conflict with the Church, of which he was excommunicated for heresy, which will be discussed. For Galileo, science was based on observation, not the Bible, and his legacy lives on.\nThe Scientific Revolution in the 17th Century\nThe 17th century was a time of important developments in European thought. A scientific revolution occurred at this time, and it brought about a lot of progress in the study of astronomy and other sciences. In this lecture, we will learn about how this happened and what happened during it. Some important people from this time who made important discoveries will be described as well. These revolutions in science and philosophy were important for the development of the scientific revolution.\nEvidence"

        "output": "What if Isaac Newton had focused on biology instead of physics?\" asked Robert Hazen, director of the Geophysical Laboratory and co-author of a book with Seiffert and a forthcoming one called \"Origins: The Quest for Our Cosmic Roots.\"\n\"It's conceivable that a few million years of tinkering with these molecules could have led to the origin of life,\" he said. \"I can't see any good reason, though, why the same chemistry that led to life on Earth cannot in fact have occurred on another planet.\"\nSehifert was one of more than 40 experts to share their views during a conference held earlier this month at George Washington University in Washington. Sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, many of the participants came from the space sciences, astrobiology, cosmology and planetary science fields. Some noted that it is hard to imagine Mars and Earth being so similar that life could have appeared on the two planets at the same time.\n\"We don't have the data to say where the 'golden spike' is on Mars, since life may not have appeared there at all,\" said David Revesz, an astrobiologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center near Flagstaff, Ariz.\nAstrogeologist and geologist-planetary-scientists were also asked to submit questions to the scientific community via e-mail. After reviewing the scientific literature, they said there was no consensus of a \"significant and compelling evidence\" for life on Mars, although some geoscientists believed that the planet's climate may have been more hospitable to life in the past, with longer, warmer summers and greater precipitation.\nMars could be habitable in its early history, if it was similar to the early Earth, according to a University of Southern California-based Mars rover project manager. By the time the rovers landed, they would have found ancient shorelines, lakes or even swamps, and could then be sent out to determine if they found life, said Jim Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. If Mars looked like our planet about 3 billion years ago, it may have had a thicker atmosphere that allowed oceans to exist and therefore a greater potential for life, he said.\n\"If we were to find things on Mars that were very similar or identical to biological activity, I would be astounded,\" he said.\nAs to the question of whether Mars could someday become Earth, which is known to have undergone a series of devastating asteroid strikes that resulted in mass extinctions, \"We are in the beginning of our evolution,\" he said.\nScientists have speculated that asteroids may have sparked the evolution of life on Earth by delivering bits of microorganisms, microfossils and \"mixed-bag molecules\" that led to life, said Garvin. The impact was especially important in shaping life, he said, because it was the only type of mass extinction that was caused by something biological.\n\"Is there a point of no come back?\" he asked. \"I don't see it yet.\"\nCopyright  2006 Reuters Ltd.\nScrip: 2007-01-20\nLast Updated Thursday, January 20, 2006 - 20:18:00 PM EDT"

        "output": "What if the Beatles had never formed as a band?!\nIn that case, I guess we’d be getting the Yellow Submarine and the White Album from each of them in solo form, along with Magical Mystery Tour and Revolver to round out other projects that didn’t make it into their own, but overall, it’s a moot point … the Beatles’ influence is forever and they left us with some of the greatest music ever made, and we are all the better for it.\nA Bigger Bang\nA Bigger Bang (2005)\nOne more? Yep, we need more Lennon/McCartney/Harrison, so here’s a bit more of that, and the album is even more varied and diverse than its three predecessors with a smattering of disco, folk, gospel and of course some rock ‘n roll too.\nThere’s the funky and slightly disco-ish “Don’t Let Me Down” backed with the “silly love song,” “I’m Satisfied” – which to our ears sounds like “I’m Happy Just To Dance With You” by the Beatles. There’s a lovely gospel-tinged take on “What Is Life” and a gorgeous remake of “Mother Nuzzing,” featuring Paul and Ringo backing John for the first time since “I’m Down” from Help! in 1965 (and one of the last Lennon songs he’d release before his death, on Double Fantasy in 1980).\nThere’s a pair of covers with interesting Beatles connections – they’re both by Bob Dylan, first there’s “Mr. Tambourine Man” which Dylan gave to the Byrds in 1965 at the height of their fame. The Beatles covered the song (and the Byrds!) on the second side of the “Rubber Soul” album. Then they also cover Dylan’s “I Want You,” which he released by himself on his 1966 LP, “Blonde on Blonde” – although the Beatles also covered it on The White album in 1968 in a rather sloppy live version.\nAs the last “Solo Albums,” A Bigger Bang is kind of a fitting conclusion to a four-album run of music. A Bigger Bang is also the end of the Fab Four’s classic period, as the breakup and subsequent Beatles breakup is almost inevitable following this album and the dissolution of The Beatles itself was only a couple years away.\nThe song that best encapsulates the band’s end is “Somedays,” which is a ballad where a couple are talking about growing old and losing their youth as they remember the good times they’ve enjoyed, and how things aren’t as good as they once were. John, Paul and Ringo all contribute vocals, but George is not heard on this song for the first time since “Do You Want To Know A Secret” in 1963, so the song feels somewhat like it’s the end for the band itself.\nA Bigger Bang is in part a “best of” compilation, as there are some previously-released tracks: “Don’t Let Me Down,” along with “I’m Satisfied,” “I’ve Got A Feeling” and “Two Of Us” (which they had released on the “Let It Be…Naked” album in 2003). But this is also in part a fresh start without any of the band, and there are many more new songs than we’re used to. This is also the first album since “Magical Mystery Tour” where John doesn’t have the lead vocals on the majority of the tracks, and we have a chance to hear all four of them as solo artists, and while it’s a mixed bag, there are some gems here. There are a few of my favorite Lennon songs, including “Somedays,” “I’m Satisfied,” “Going Down On Love” and “She Looks Good To Me”\nThis album is a worthy addition to the Lennon/McCartney catalog, which is no small feat, and there is no denying the contribution of each member. A Bigger Bang was produced by Yoko Ono, and while you can hear her influence, there’s something about this album that’s just Beatles, and that’s part of its charm. John, Paul, George and Ringo – four different people, but they were never better than when together, and A Bigger Bang captures that perfectly.\nJohn Lennon & Yoko Ono\nLennondisco\nMore Lennon, we could hardly ask for more, but perhaps only one more album is possible. This one is more obscure – Lennon didn’t contribute to it – but it’s a bit of a Lennon curiosity … it’s the second and last album from John and Yoko ("

You might see Turing as the quintessential mathematician and think of him as more of an abstract abstract theorist than as a man with important contributions to society, but it’s not like he never did anything in life other than work on codebreaking theory. Turing made huge contributions to computing and artificial intelligence, which are a lot more relevant than codebreaking, and those contributions are now considered essential to much of what’s going on in our lives today.\nIn this video, Turing’s friend and colleague Roger Penrose explains what would have happened if the British had developed computers before the Germans, which may seem like a silly question. He’s also in a video here talking about Turing’s contributions in mathematics.\n(Also check out Penrose’s work on quantum mechanics here, and his ideas about the limitations of logic as a basis for physics here .)\n(Cross-posted at Rationally Speaking)\nFiled Under: Mathematics, Society & Culture Tagged With: Alan Turing, Artificial Intelligence, Computing, Enigma, Enigma Code, Enigma Machine, Mathematics, Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Roger Penrose, World War II"

        "output": "What if the Suez Canal had never been constructed?\nIf the Suez Canal had never been constructed, it is doubtful that Great Britain would have entered the First World War. In 1914, Great Britain was still the world's largest manufacturer, her fleet was the largest and most technologically advanced in the world, and her navies, army and air force were strong by most standards. However, that strength was dependent upon her global access and the dominance of the British Empire. She would have found it very difficult to wage such a war without control of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Britain's entry into the war hinged largely upon the defeat of the Turks and the opening of the Suez Canal to traffic. After being closed in 1914, the Suez Canal was reopened in February 1915, making travel from Britain easier to India and the Middle East. This improved Britain's strategic position and helped Great Britain secure an alliance with France, a significant step as Britain had previously been reluctant to form such an alliance and had in fact been very wary of a large naval and land force on the continent. The Allies, along with the United States, used this combined effort to counter Germany's successful war efforts in both Europe and Africa.\nWhile there is debate over how much the Suez Canal's construction impacted foreign policy, few doubt it was important, as Britain would not have fought in World War I had the Suez Canal not been built. Likewise, had this canal been destroyed by Germany in its unsuccessful attack on Egypt, it is unlikely that Britain would have fought in World War I. The strategic importance of the Suez Canal cannot be overstated.\nSources: University of Texas at San Antonio\nThe Suez Canal and the Suez Crisis\nThe Suez Crisis was a British, French and Israeli attempt in 1956 to oust the Egyptian government. In 1956 Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal under President Nasser. The three nations planned on the canal's resumption to civilian use and control by Western nations. They made an agreement among themselves to stop Egypt's attempts to nationalize Egypt's other assets. Then the British, French, and Israelis invaded Egypt and bombarded Egypt with ships to regain control of the Suez. However, the Russians intervened by blocking the flow of Soviet funds to Israel and, further, the Americans told the British and French about their plan to invade Egypt. Britain and France were forced to back off, and the U. N. helped broker a cease-fire. There was no peace deal, there was no agreement except to stop the violence.\nSource: www.fpri.org\nIf the Suez Canal had never been constructed it is doubtful that Great Britain would have entered World War I as Great Britain was still the world's largest manufacturer, and her fleet was the largest and most technologically advanced in the world, and her navy, army and air force were strong by the standards of most other military forces in the world. However, that strength was highly dependent upon Britain's global presence and the dominance of the British Empire. Had the Suez Canal never been constructed, it is unlikely that Britain would have been involved in World War I as Britain would have found it difficult to wage such a war without control of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. After being closed in 1914, the Suez Canal was reopened in February 1915, but this did not change the situation as Britain still needed to have some form of naval presence in the Indian Ocean. The Suez Crisis in 1956 shows that the Suez Canal is essential to the British Empire (and by extension, the American Empire). In the Second World War, the Allied forces were able to defeat Germany and Italy in Europe.\nIn 1955, when Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, British and French officials considered the following options:\n-to pressure Egypt to reconsider and privatize the canal\n-to negotiate with Egypt and Egypt's allies (the United States and the Soviet Union) on this question\n-to prepare for war\n-to find a peaceful solution to the nationalization of the canal\nThe first two options were rejected because they could not ensure that the canal would not be nationalized and because the United States would have been more willing to compromise than the Soviet Union. The third option, war, was chosen for two reasons: the perceived need to maintain access to the Mediterranean Sea, and the belief that the war would serve as a diplomatic opening to a \"third way\" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This belief was based on the idea that the Suez Crisis would serve as an example to all nations of their need to abide by the rules of international law, including the United Nations Charter.

The VOC's activities in China and India come into question. If the Dutch East India Company had not been in India, if it hadn't been started in VOC at all, who knows what Indian art would look like today. Would America be more European-looking, or would it look more African or Asian?\nWhat if? What if? What if? What if? What if? What if? What if? What if? What if? What if?\nI was very pleased when it was decided to open a branch of the museum and display a collection of paintings, including Rembrandt's \"The Jewish Bride,\" so beloved to the VOC.\nThe VOC Art Collection was created as early as 1620, and was to be considered a separate entity from the company.\nAnd so, the VOC Art Collection was also called the Rembrandt Collection, although Rembrandt wasn't a member, not even a shareholder. All he did was paint a picture for the Amsterdam chapter -- a portrait of Johannes Michiel, the Grand Treasurer -- and this painting later became known simply as \"The VOC.\"\nMany other pictures by Rembrandt were to be bought or donated. For example, the VOC bought, from the heirs of his son, the portrait of Willem van de Velde. And after Rembrandt's death, his wife asked for help from the art lover Michiel and even offered to paint a portrait of him in exchange for some of his paintings. Her proposal was made for 12 large paintings, but because she's an artist herself, she knew it didn't make sense to make a portrait of someone that has passed away. A painting of a person still alive is a portrait of the living person, but a painting of someone that has passed away is a memorial, a painting with a meaning. On a painting of her, Rembrandt painted her son Titus.\nAnd so, when Michiel asked, \"What do you want?\" she responded,\n\"I want The Jewish Bride. I have a letter saying that Rembrandt will give it to me if I need it\" -- referring to Michiel's request to Rembrandt, asking if The Jewish Bride will remain with the VOC after Rembrandt's own death.\nHe said he would.\nRembrandt was known to be in good company, having received help from Michiel many times, and Michiel was known for collecting art. Because Rembrandt was dead by then, the VOC was asked to take responsibility for The Jewish Bride; it would be given to another art lover, another company, another country... as Rembrandt himself had wanted it to be.\nOn March 15th, 2017, that's exactly how it happened: it was auctioned; it was sold and then it was sent to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.\nIt was sold for 6.84 million euros.\nWe didn't get to see it, it's locked up in a safe.\nThe museum will not be displaying Rembrandt's most famous painting, but perhaps it will be better for The Rijks to have it.\nThe VOC had more than The Rembrandt Collection, but only that collection was mentioned by name. The other collection (the Rembrandt Collection) was officially called the VOC Art Collection, a collection with 54 paintings, all by Rembrandt, including the original portrait of his son Titus, who became the \"living\" person, and who had been added as a posthumous character to The Jewish Bride (his picture was in it also) to complete Rembrandt's intended meaning.\nIt was the first Dutch art collection.\nOn a previous blog post, I mentioned how The Rijksmuseum got its name from a former inn, the Rijkershuys, which had a private art collection; the collection consisted of 224 paintings acquired by the wealthy burgomaster Jacob de Rijcke, and which he left to the city at the time of his death, and which have remained there ever since. The VOC Art Collection was part of The Rijksmuseum's founding, as was the painting of Jacob de Rijcke's painting collection (pictured at the top).\nThis painting \"has historical merit,\" and so a small exhibition about it has been opened, showing it as part of the museum for the first time in decades.

        "output": "What if Vincent van Gogh had been a successful artist during his lifetime?\nThe French painter and sculptor Auguste Rodin made this prediction to his friend Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec early in the twentieth century. At the time, Toulouse-Lautrec was attempting to help van Gogh, a painter with whom he shared a turbulent friendship, with the last works and letters before his suicide. Rodin’s prediction foretelling of the subsequent success of van Gogh’s work was not completely untrue: after his death, his art and reputation grew. And yet Toulouse-Lautrec had told Rodin the same thing after meeting van Gogh in Paris. The two had become friends through Toulouse-Lautrec’s connection with Edgar Degas, another French painter. But as Toulouse-Lautrec and van Gogh began to paint together, the young artist started to criticize Degas’ style.\nAuguste Rodin, Portrait of Vincent van Gogh (c. 1912).\nThe last time Toulouse-Lautrec saw van Gogh, the younger artist was about to take his own life. There was a sense of hopelessness at this time for van Gogh, as his last works and letters would make clear. Van Gogh, who struggled to make a living as an art dealer, had been unable to develop the skills he needed to sell his work. It is this that led him to an attempt on his own life, although most historians have concluded that the attack was the result of the mental illness (then known as epilepsy) that he would suffer most of his life.[1]\nRodin wrote to Toulouse-Lautrec, suggesting that a successful showing of van Gogh’s work in Paris might save him from committing suicide. After Toulouse-Lautrec returned and reported on the show, no longer wanting to paint, Rodin’s prediction came true.\nThe show featured roughly six hundred works by van Gogh, who painted them in his last fifteen months of life. Toulouse-Lautrec was not sure whether to report on the display, fearing it would bring unwanted attention to van Gogh. In his autobiography, L’argent et la gloire (Money and Fame), Toulouse-Lautrec recalls asking his mother for her opinion on the matter:\nMon père pensait que mon oncle n’avait plus la force de travailler, et que sa seule tâche était de passer son temps à décharger au plus haut point les dernières années de sa vie. S’il vivait encore longtemps et reprenait, ainsi, quelques années de jeunesse, cela pouvait lui servir. Mon parrain, qui était un pâtre et n’en avait pas plus de sept ans, lui ayant demandé si il avait fait, depuis son retour à Aix, un peu de dessins ou de peintures, avait reu une rétribution décevante. — Peindrez-vous encore, mon cher ami, lui avait demandé le chevalier, vous êtes très bon dessinateur à l’œuvre. — Peindre, lui avait répondu mon parrain, oui, comme mon parrain d’autrefois, j’ai la tendance à peindre. Il allait laisser d’autres le soin de cette chose.\n“My father thought that my uncle could no longer work and that his only task in life was to spend the last years of his life doing nothing. If he lived on, he might gain some more years of youth. My godfather, who was an artist and had already been in the business for less than seven years, gave him a fee that was disappointing. ‘Do you continue to paint, dear friend,’ he asked him, ‘you are doing very good drawings at work.’ ‘I will paint,’ my godfather had answered, ‘just like my godfather of old times, I have a tendency to paint. I leave it to other people to do the work.’”[2]\nAuguste Rodin, Van Gogh's Mother and Sister at Amsterdam (c. 1912).\nThe show was held in 1912 at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. During the next few months, van Gogh sold roughly 2,700 paintings via 97 different sales.[3] In the last six months of his life, van Gogh generated about a quarter of his total income from those works alone. The show also included fifty of his most recent letters to Theo,"

Discuss your solution.\n5. Present your solution.\n1. Identify a problem.\nThe problem I am facing is.\nSometimes when I am writing a program which is working with user input if the user enters special characters then they are getting recognized as numbers.\nExample If user types \"abc127\" instead of \"abc\" program is taking both character's as digit i.e. 1 and 2 .\nIn this case I want to identify when the user is entering a digit or a character and take them accordingly. When the user gets input of digit, then it should be converted into string and if the user gets input for a letter then it should be accepted as user input.\nAlso If the user enters a sequence of numbers like \"1@rts27234324\" then also it should be considered as input as letters.\nI think the example for your problem provided by you (user entering a sequence of numbers) is not appropriate.\nIt may be more appropriate for the user to enter the sequence as a word (example: abc123). I think you will have to check for the space character, or any other delimiter, that is not a number or character.\nOtherwise I think the approach below will work.\n2.

Discuss your solution.\nI will write my discussion first and then the solution so that it becomes easier to understand what I have proposed in the first place.\n4. Present your solution.\nI have a program that does what I asked in the problem. I will write the code first and then the discussion :)\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nvector<string> getInputWord() {\n    int ch;\n    string inputWord = \"\";\n    cout << \"input a word\" << endl;\n    while ((ch = getchar()) != '\\n') {\n        inputWord += ch;\n        cout << ch;\n    }\n    while (getchar() != '\\n') {\n        cout << \" \";\n        cin.unget();\n    }\n\n    return inputWord;\n}\n\nvoid setInputWordToStrings() {\n    string inputWord = getInputWord();\n    for (int i = 0; i < inputWord.length(); i++) {\n        inputWord[i] = getchar();\n    }\n}\n\nint countNumberOfOccurrence(string inputWord, string myWord) {\n    int counter = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < inputWord.length(); i++) {\n        if (inputWord[i] == myWord[0]) {\n            for(int j = 1; j < myWord.length(); j++) {\n                if(inputWord[i + j - 1] == myWord[j]) {\n                    counter++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return counter;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    string inputWord;\n    string myWord = \"abc\";\n    setInputWordToStrings();\n\n    if (myWord[0] != inputWord[0]) {\n    }\n    else {\n        int counters = countNumberOfOccurrence(inputWord, myWord);\n        cout << counters;\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: The way you are going to deal with this is to not try to catch if getchar() == 1, but to treat it as character input. So you will need to create a different routine for \"number\" input (which probably also is the solution to your \"123\" == 123, because that will return true.). \nHowever, your solution for \"abc\", or \"abc123ab123a\" will still be correct. It will check up to and including the first character that makes it out of the string. Whether it is a number or a letter is in the source code, so you will have to parse it and make sure it is a number or letter before you move on. (This is probably not the best approach, but it would be relatively easy"

This is because the part to be interpreted first must be located at the left-hand side of the expression.\n\n# Nested loops\n\nIn Python, you can use a standard for loop to iterate through the values of one data structure for a particular period of time. In many cases, it might be good to loop over all the elements of the second list after executing the loop over the value of the first list. It is good to separate the second list into several rows based on the number of elements of the first list. The following code and diagram shows you how you can do this:\n\n**Code** : Let's declare two lists, `student_list` and `marks_list`, both are of the type `List[int]`. Let them get initialized with the following code:\n\n  * student_list = list()\n\n  * marks_list = list()\n\n  * student_list.append(1)\n\n  * student_list.append(2)\n\n  * student_list.append(3)\n\nIn this case, the first element of the marks list is initialized with 0, so the following code will be executed:\n\n  * marks_list.append(0)\n\nNow, let's add the second list to the first list, and the following code will be executed:\n\n  * for ele in student_list:\n\n  *     marks_list.append(1)\n\nIn this part, both lists are read and processed in parallel. In this case, both lists are filled with the value `1`, as shown here:\n\n    1 2 3 0\n\nAlso, the following statement will be executed:\n\n    marks_list.append(2)\n\nWhen the for loop is processed, each item is read and the corresponding value of the item is stored as a list at the same time using `marks_list` as shown here:\n\n    1 2 3 0 2 \n\nIf you add `4`, it will be a little bit different from the preceding values. You will get the following result:\n\n    4 1 2 3 0 2 4  \n\nSo, it is clear to see that the `marks_list` is filled with the value `1` three times and `2` three times. Also, the value `4` has been added twice. If you want to loop over all the data in the `marks_list` then the following code will do the following:\n\n  * for each_marks in marks_list:\n\n  *     print(each_marks)\n\nThe last statement will print the list in pairs as shown here:\n\n    0\n\n    1\n\n    2\n\n    3\n\n    4 \n\n    1 \n\n    2 \n\n    3\n\n    4\n\nNow, if you want to have nested for loops, then the following code will help you:\n\n    **for student_index in student_list:**\n\n    **print(\"Student: \" + str(student_list[student_index]))**\n\n    **for each_mark in marks_list:**\n\n    **if each_mark == 0:**\n\n    **continue**\n\n    **elif each_mark == 1:**\n\n    **print(\"Marks: \" + \"1\")**\n\n    **elif each_mark == 2:**\n\n    **print(\"Marks: \" + \"2\")**\n\n    **else:**\n\n    **print(\"Marks: \" + \"3\")**\n\nThe result will be shown"

The work has been so interesting and meaningful, and I am so proud of how my skills have grown. I’ve felt like I have grown so much over this year and the company has been a big part of that.

Our homes, our place to live, are so important. Home can also be a place like this.\nIs it a company I could see myself in a similar position in, in three years?\nAt some point I would like to move away from the consulting and into more in-house work. This opportunity has given me the confidence and training to help. So I hope you can find someone here that I can mentor as well or work here long enough to feel confident that I’ll have the experience and skills to be able do so further in the future.\nIs there more we have covered that you think needs to be said?\nI want to make sure the people who worked with me know I would consider myself a good employee. I try to get the job done and do what is asked of me professionally and that has always come through with me at all jobs I’ve had. I hope to never bring my employers, any of them, to task.

I still really enjoy the work and, although I’m ready for a rest, I’m not actively looking to find myself in a new position.\nWill you miss this client?\nAbsolutely! I would be so sad if I didn’t get to continue working with them and see what more they will be doing in the future.\nAre there any other issues you’d like to discuss with me?\nAre you asking me about this resignation letter and the future?\nCan we schedule this?\nThere is a lot to contemplate and discuss that you have presented to me today. I feel an obligation to be an honest listener to you and help you with what you want.\nDo you mind if I ask you a few questions?\nNo. I’d be very interested to hear how you will help me with my problem?\nAre you willing to discuss something of a more personal nature with me?\nHow far are you from this letter going to go?\nAre you interested in helping me find a job? I’d like to help my wife and my family.\nWould you like me to help you find a job?\nYes. The problem is, I need to find a job. I’m burnt out.

No, that’s everything I would be willing to discuss.\nAre you willing to discuss something of a more personal nature with me, such as my wife or my family?\nIt’s just that when I told them I was looking to leave work early they said I should talk to my wife.

        "output": "Draft an apology email to a customer who experienced a delay in their order, and provide reassurance that the issue has been resolved.\nWrite a thank-you email to customers who leave positive reviews on your website or on Google.\nCustomize subject lines. Different emails require different subject lines to persuade recipients to open and read your emails. For example, when sending a reminder email to boost sales, a subject line like, “I need your help!” would grab the recipient’s attention while a more formal subject like, “Inquiry regarding Item 3073” would not. On the other hand, a subject line in your follow-up email, like, “Thanks for your purchase last week” would make perfect sense. You get the point.\nThe best approach to writing email subject lines is to consider the action the recipient is taking. For example, if you already know you have a customer who is very loyal you may choose to address that customer’s name in the subject of the email. If you’re sending an email to someone you’ve never met before, your subject could be written as a question instead.\nCreate a list and put your customers into categories. If you have multiple emails to send out, try to create a list of your customers who fall into certain categories. Instead of trying to customize emails to fit each of your 40 customers, you can create several categories and send emails to every email recipient who meets the defined criteria. This not only saves you time but also makes your emails look more tailored since you’re appealing to specific demographics that are more likely to convert.\nSend email updates based on customer needs. Are you getting frequent questions from customers about how to find you on your website? If so, you can send a customer a customized set of answers that include your website’s address and the steps they can take to get to you on the website. If you’re a jewelry designer you can also send your customers who are looking for rings a link to your ring-related articles. This will help you set yourself apart from other business’s that don’t offer this type of service.\nProvide a link to your product catalogue. In addition to making it easy for your customers to find you on your website, it’s important that you make it easy for your customers to browse your product catalogue with a quick click of their mouse or a swipe of their phone. This will also improve your SEO since it’s a highly optimized landing page for your website.\nUse your emails to send your customers a special code that they can use on your website or mobile app. The point of these codes is to make it easier for customers to purchase what they want. If a customer is looking to buy an item or accessories from a particular country, sending them a code that they can enter on your site, they will be more likely to purchase. However, make sure you are clear about whether or not your customers get codes to purchase your products.\nAlways keep in mind that your emails can be easily read on a phone or tablet. Try to minimize your emails to 2 or 3 lines. Consider all of your email messages as an invitation for someone to engage with your business and make an immediate purchase if possible.\nMake your email personal. When emailing your customers, address them by name. Include information about their contact preferences, such as email, phone or mailing address.\nMake sure to mention your current sale events. If you’re in the middle of a big sale this won’t apply but otherwise, you’ll definitely want this point in your list.\nMake it easy for customers to find you on your website. Email links. In addition to using social media to find your business, customers will also want an easier way to search for your products on your website. Create product searches and include them in your emails for a more personalized and simplified shopping experience.\nUse your email sign-up form to find out what your customers are searching for and send the products to them directly.\nAsk for feedback and reviews. In addition to giving customers an opportunity to shop directly from your website, they’ll also be more likely to share their personal experience with your business. You can ask customers to share photos or testimonials about your products and services. Another way to achieve this is to send a reminder or thank you email to customers who mention you on Twitter or Facebook.\nUse the email sign-up form to collect information about the types of products and services customers are interested in.\nUse your newsletter to find out more about popular trends. You can create a survey to find out if your customers want to learn about specific things like the latest celebrity jewelry trends or new design styles. You can also create a survey to learn about what you can do better, or if there are any areas you need to focus on in your product categories.\nOffer your newsletter to customers who are likely to respond to your business.

        "output": "Write a captivating movie review for a recently released science fiction film, discussing its plot, characters, and special effects.\nEssay on The Matrix (1999) for the AP Language and Composition Course\nThe use of visual effects and voice-over in the science fiction film, The Matrix (1999), demonstrates how cinema in the twenty-first century uses special effects to explore concepts of reality and individual identity\nA Narrative Essay on a Fictional Character Who Uses The Matrix as a Basis for an Ideology\nIn this short narrative essay, the subject examines Neo from The Matrix as a character who has a philosophy based on certain aspects of reality. This narrative essay demonstrates the subject's ability to present a thesis for an argument by using a narrative tone to address the ideas presented in the fictional film, The Matrix.\nThe film used for analysis is The Matrix (1999), directed by the Wachowski brothers.\nIn this narrative paper, the subject addresses the subject of individuality with respect to Neo from The Matrix. The film and its philosophical premise are discussed through the subject's narration, with some supporting quotations from the visual text of The Matrix (1999). The first paragraph of this narrative essay explores the philosophical questions raised by the subject to demonstrate his interest in the ideas presented. The second paragraph begins with an epigraph taken from The Matrix (1999) and continues with an analysis of the film's concept of individual identity, and the implications that Neo's experiences with The Matrix have for his development as a person. These ideas are then demonstrated through a series of narrative paragraphs that describe Neo's development from a confused individual to a more self-realized person as she grows within his self-concept.\nFor example, one paragraph describes Neo's experiences when his identity is questioned by his friend, Trinity, in the presence of Agent Smith and Morpheus. Through this narration, the subject demonstrates neo's confusion by comparing his experiences in The Matrix to the experiences of real world individuals. He then goes on to describe how Neo's newfound identity of \"the one\" in the second film was forged from his real-world experiences with Morpheus and Trinity. This is a narrative paper that takes the reader through a fictional concept, but as a writer, they are allowed to assume that the events described by Neo were factual because the subject doesn't provide any evidence that proves otherwise. For example, the subject is allowed to describe Neo's experiences with The Red Pill and The Blue Pill because Neo himself doesn't know whether these events truly happened or not.\nThis narrative paper is an example of an academic essay that is written in a way that allows students to describe certain concepts from narrative fiction that is presented to them by others.\nEssay on The Matrix (1999) for the AP Language and Composition Course\nThe use of voice-over and camera effects in the science fiction film The Matrix (1999), by the Wachowski brothers, illustrates how film and television in the twenty-first century has developed to include more sophisticated visual images that convey the filmmaker's message to the audience.\nThe first paragraph of this narrative essay discusses the theme of the second paragraph in more detail. It outlines the main points of the essay and provides a summary of the events that took place, as well as some visual examples of what you will find on the Internet, in books, and in a movie theater. For all of these examples, it is important to note that the text cited should be accurate and not simply a listing of websites. This article would also benefit from photographs, but it does not provide the reader with the opportunity to see them firsthand. Some of the photographs may also be copyrighted.\nWhen creating this essay, it's important to take care to follow any copyright laws that may apply to the website. The purpose of this essay is to show how film has become more sophisticated and visually enhanced over the years.\nFor an essay on a movie, the second paragraph provides a more in-depth look at the character of Neo and his experiences. This paragraph discusses how Neo's experiences in the fictional world have brought him closer to his own identity, and also how his character has developed over time. The reader should also be aware that the focus of the essay is not solely on the film itself, but also on the other characters in its story. To that end, the following examples should indicate how the three actors in this film have improved their acting abilities.\nWhile it is true that all films today display some form of enhanced special effects, it is important to note that The Matrix was the first major feature to show that this technology was viable. In addition to special effects, the film also utilized innovative camera techniques. The third paragraph discusses the use of special effects in this film.\nThe Wachowski Brothers, in addition to creating a film with a plot that involves humans and other creatures called 'souls,'"

        "output": "Structure a podcast script for an episode discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry.\nAnalyze and evaluate existing media (for example, podcasts, articles, music reviews, fan forums, etc.) to analyze their impact on the genre(s) your podcast covers.\nReview existing data and research\nFor existing data and research, you may want to start by examining:\nThe role of streaming in the music industry\nThe use of Spotify’s podcasts\nThe impact of streaming on radio formats\nThe impact of streaming on radio format demographics\nThe effect of podcasts on radio formats\nThe effect of streaming on music\nThe effect of streaming on music demographics\nHow does streaming impact the music industry?\nStreaming has become the dominant force in the music industry, with millions of listeners spending hours each week streaming their favorite artists.\nThis has led to a rise in streaming-only artists, such as Drake and Kanye West, who have become household names.\nWhile streaming has revolutionized the industry, it has also had a negative impact on the economy.\nFor instance, streaming has caused album sales to plummet, making it harder for older artists to make a living.\nConsequently, many musicians have resorted to becoming podcast hosts to make some more money.\nAdditionally, streaming has made it easier to steal music, which has led to an increase in piracy.\nFinally, streaming has led to increased competition among artists, who must now compete for attention on an increasingly crowded platform.\nThe role of Spotify’s podcasts\nWhen Spotify launched its podcasts, they hoped that it would become the dominant platform for audio content.\nThe company has invested heavily in expanding its podcast library, and its platform now includes over 70,000 shows.\nHowever, the company has come under fire from many in the music industry for not properly protecting musicians who stream their content on the platform.\nSome musicians feel that Spotify is not doing enough to compensate them for their work, and they have taken to streaming their music without permission of the artist.\nIn addition, there are worries that Spotify may be monopolizing the podcast market, and will end up leaving many artists out of pocket.\nUltimately, Spotify’s podcast platform is a mixed bag for musicians.\nIt has the potential to be a great marketplace for musicians, but it is also possible for the company to end up monopolizing the market and leaving many artists out of pocket.\nThe use of Spotify’s podcasts\nFor years, popular podcasts have aired on stations across the country.\nThese shows have attracted legions of fans, who tune in to hear their favorite hosts talk about everything from pop culture to politics.\nBut in recent years, podcast producers have been finding new ways to reach their audiences.\nOne way has been to create exclusive content for streaming platforms like Spotify.\nThis new content has the potential to change the way people listen to podcasts, and it could also help boost ratings for popular shows.\nThe impact of streaming on radio format demographics\nA recent analysis has found that streaming music services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Netflix are increasingly leading to a declining number of teenagers and young adults tuning into traditional radio.\nAccording to the research, listeners aged 14-24 are the least likely to stream music due to a lack of awareness of streaming services and the inability to use a smartphone or computer to listen.\nWhile radio stations are still highly successful among this demographic, they are no longer being used as frequently by younger audiences.\nThis could have significant ramifications for the future of radio in addition to being a loss in ad revenue.\nThe effect of podcasts on radio formats\nFor years, the radio format has been the most popular form of media for listeners.\nHowever, in recent years, streaming services have begun to gain in popularity, and some listeners are saying goodbye to traditional radio.\nThis shift has caused a dramatic drop in ratings for some traditional radio formats, such as news and talk shows.\nWhat does it mean for traditional radio formats?\nThere are several factors that are contributing to this decline in ratings, and it’s not clear what the long-term consequences will be.\nIf traditional radio formats are unable to compete with streaming services, it could mean the end of some of the most popular radio shows\nThe effect of streaming on music\nStreaming music has been a controversial topic ever since its introduction.\nSome claim that it helps artists increase their audience, while others argue that it’s leading to copyright infringement and a decline in music sales.\nNo matter what side you’re on, there is no denying that streaming music is rapidly changing the way music is consumed.\nHow has streaming music affected the music economy?\nThe debate over streaming music’s effect on the music economy has been around for years, and there is no doubt that it has had an impact.\nOne of the biggest changes has been the rise of internet-only artists, who rely solely on streaming services like Spotify and iTunes for"
