These techniques won't change your habits over night, but as time goes on, they can help you reach your goals faster than expecting for the change to happen automatically. .\n1. Make conscious decisions with the goal in mind\nYou do what you do because you know how to do it.\nIf you can do something new, you can make a conscious decision to do it instead of doing something else.\nFor example, \"I choose to eat one less dessert today.\" Instead of allowing yourself to make decisions based on an emotional or physical reaction (like eating the dessert because you're feeling stressed and hungry), you make a conscious decision to do something that you know will give you better results (like eating less dessert).\nThis technique works best if you set goals that give you a reason to do it.\nSetting goals makes you focus on the end result and the things that you get to do as part of the process. Plus, setting goals to lose weight can be an extremely motivating thing to have.\n2. Create reminders\nWhat helps you stay committed to completing your goals?\nIs it a reward system that you can look forward to? Or knowing that you will regret not completing your goal if you don't achieve it? Are you inspired by all the benefits and the future improvements that you can gain if you lose weight? Are you motivated by a loved one who's always telling you to lose weight?\nReminders have a great role in keeping your goals on track when you feel like giving up. They can be physical reminders like your meal plan and workout schedule posted in visible places in your home, or things that you can keep in your mind like why you're doing this and what you're gaining from this.\nReminders work way better if they're positive and inspiring. So make sure that your reminders are on the side of helping you achieve your goals instead of discouraging you (like your fat friends who keep telling you to stop trying to lose weight).\nWhen you feel like you're too far from your goal, having a reward system is also a great way to stay motivated (like offering yourself a free day at the spa, a new pair of shoes, or a special outing to reward yourself for reaching 5 pounds in a week, or losing 5 pounds in a week).\nSetting yourself up for success will help keep you on track when you feel like giving up.\n3. Create structure to your schedule\nStructure is one of the keys to effective goal setting.\nWhen you create a habit, structure makes it easier to stay consistent and focused on achieving your goals when you can rely on a routine instead of having to think about doing the things you need to do every day.\nEven if you're the type who likes to have the freedom to do whatever you want to do at each moment, creating a structured routine for your day can help you keep your energy and focus where you want it to be.\nFor example, if your goal is to plan your meals for the week ahead, you can make having a weekly meal plan structured in your schedule by scheduling it to happen every Sunday and writing it in your calendar.\nBy having a structured routine and committing to it, you're less likely to fall off track and skip a day and more likely to have a consistent habit that helps you lose weight.\n4. Monitor your progress to keep yourself motivated\nWe can lose focus quicker than we think. And sometimes we even forget how far we've come.\nFor example, when you set your goal to lose 10 pounds, you may be motivated to do what it takes to get there. But without keeping track of your progress, you can end up losing steam and feeling overwhelmed again by where you want to be.\nTracking your progress can help you see how far you've come and the improvements that you've made. With a simple chart, you"

        "instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?",
        "output": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me? Dear Sister, Although my brother may be playing a joke on you, kickball is a game designed to help people exercise and have fun at the same time. The object of the game is to score more runs during a certain period of time than your opponent. To be successful, the players will try and hit the ball, and advance bases for their team. The game is played for five innings. Each run is worth one point, and the team with the most runs at the end of each inning wins. The teams will always alternate taking turns in hitting the ball. One person will kick the ball and try to hit the base in front of them. After they do that, they will run to the next base in front of them. If they make it around all bases, they will have scored a run for their team. Now, back to the original question. Are you sure you don't want to play with your brother and his friends? If yes, you might want to make sure you play under the same rules as your opponent. Otherwise, they could try and take advantage of you by playing under a different set of rules. This way, you would have to deal with unfair players. You should make sure you know the rules first, and if your opponent doesn't follow them, let your umpire know who will then take care of it. Good luck with finding someone trustworthy who wants to play with you and your sister! Let your brother know he can stop playing tricks on you and start playing some kickball instead! From, A Reader Dear Readers, Didn't today's reader get some good advice from your columnist?

It sounds like your \"super\" friends are being very thoughtful and helpful friends! Dear Readers, Did you find this week's column helpful?

I have been taking this supplement for about 3 days now. I noticed my skin is improving quite a bit. It has a lot more color and I've started to actually see some of my acne scars start to go away and disappear. So my question is, do the whiteheads that haven't popped completely start disappearing when you take the supplement? or is everything that you take just to the surface? I would love some answers because I know you guys and gals are just as obsessed with your skin as I am. thanks.\nHi, and thanks for the site. I recently purchased the entire kit, and it only helped with the skin on my face, but it has made my chest and back very oily. Could it be a side effect that I'm getting more oily skin? I guess I would rather get oily skin than get acne again. Does anyone else have this problem?\nhi. I had quite a severe case of cystic acne at 13 and had a very noticeable skin tone. I also have a low tolerance to antibiotics but it hasn't improved since then. I'm 16 now and I have been using natural ways of treatment (probiotics, fruit/vegetable intake and avoidance of carbs and dairy) but my acne returns once a month every month. When i was 15 I developed cystic acne on my chin and neck and now it's back 2 months later and more serious. I think it may be because of the season. I just started changing my diet to see where it comes from and I'm starting a pro-biotic to help clear up my gut. My skin is clearer though and I'm hoping that things will improve. Anyone else have any advice? I've tried everything from different skin care routines, antibiotics, diet change and stress reduction but still haven't seen any signs of improvement.\nThank you for the great review. I'll be on a waitlist for the kit. Just wondering if this will help my sensitive skin that has oily t-zone acne even after using prescription topical creams like ESCAPE. Also, for people who take blood thinners and have bad bruising, will the kit make the bruising more noticeable since you're taking a lot of vitamins? Thanks in advance for your help.\nI'm super thrilled (and I don't exaggerate) to hear everything that you've been able to accomplish. Not only are you an awesome writer, you're also able to be authentic and honest about anything and everything, which is something very few people can truly say about themselves. It's definitely something you should be very proud of and definitely something that's made my life so much better. I wish you could have seen the joy and relief on my husband's face when I told him that our son was going to be born because we were finally going to get a little bit of a handle on his acne. For him, there's not much more that could make a dad happy than seeing his son without acne and being the picture-perfect guy of his dreams. Thanks, as always!\nI have been on the waiting list since September. Will your product finally be available to purchase? I am so excited to give it a try! Thank you for the wonderful review!\nI am not a doctor so I cannot tell you why your skin is oily. The only thing from the review that makes sense is that 3 bottles should only last 21 days or so. Maybe your skin is just used to your current skin routine and you need to give it more time to adjust to the new skin routine.\nYou're totally right about the diet. It's the most important factor in treating acne. Also, if you don't have a way of fighting bacteria naturally, your results will be worse.\nI started on your regimen and had immediate results.

Our weird traditions were more like, \"Hey, let's have a Christmas tree! Let's go to midnight mass!\" Things like that. And then one year we did, \"How 'bout we get a snotty old snowball in a puddle to kiss under the tree? I mean, it's probably going to be alive, but who really cares?\" But, I mean Christmas was a big deal in our family. So in a way we probably had weird traditions. Like, Christmas morning and opening up presents and running down to, because our house was like in a gulch, or it was on the slopes, and we'd run around and play in the snow. And my best friend, and she had a sister and a brother. And we went to school together. We were all like kindergarteners and went to school together.

        "instruction": "Do you know why cats always rub up against your legs?",
        "output": "Do you know why cats always rub up against your legs? It‚Äôs an ancient gesture of friendship, which means cats are not afraid of us and that we can trust them. Of course, there are bad cats who can only come to your door to beg, but if they‚Äôre really friendly to you, there‚Äôs no need to worry about them! 2. Do you know why dogs always put their heads to your hand or push their nose into your jeans or skirt? The meaning of such gestures is that they are welcoming you and want play with you. Sometimes, it also means that they want to ask you for a walk or to play in the yard. What you don‚Äôt know is that dogs who are well-trained and grow up with the family will be especially lovely and loyal. 3. Do you know why rabbits put their ears forward? As you have known, rabbits are very sweet and intelligent animals, but they often have bad temper. So when they feel angry or want to attack, their ears will be folded back and their eyes will look strange. When their ears are held forward, it means that they are happy to see you. When you see your rabbit's ears folded or its eyes look strange, don‚Äôt force them to get along with you. Instead, just give them some time to calm down and they will become happy again. 4. Do you know why turtles have a sticky tongue? As the turtle has a special way of catching its food, when they put their head into your hand, it‚Äôs not because they want to catch food from you. In fact, they just want to get close with you and you can feel the warmth of their head. But be noted that if you stick your fingers into their mouth, they will hurt your fingers! Be careful! 5. Do you know an echidna or spiny anteater? The echidna has a short stub of an arm and a thick, spiny coat which is often green or blue with a long black snout. Spiny anteater is the largest and most carnivorous of its family, with the long snout, bushy ears and a tail that is bushy on the upper surface and spiky on the lower surface. Echidnas like to sit under logs out of the sun and spiny anteater like to live in wet areas. They both have a large diet that consists mostly of other invertebrates, including termites and ants. Echidnas have thick furry bodies like pigs and a lump on their back which looks like a pig's. Spiny anteater has a long snout, bushy ears and a tail that is bushy on the upper surface and spiky on the lower surface. They have a large diet that consists mostly of other invertebrates, including termites and ants. Echidnas have thick furry bodies like pigs and a lump on their back which looks like a pig's. The main difference is that spiny anteater has the sticky saliva that they can shoot up to 6 inches (15 cm) toward their prey. In fact, it looks like when you touch spiny anteater, it will stick to your hands! Spiny anteater are also called ‚Äúant bear‚Äù because their long snout and thick fur help them to look like the bear. Their main habitats are wet areas, though, as the echidnas, the spiny anteater also like to sit under logs out of the sun. 6. Do you know what a possum is? Possums are very different looking creatures with a short, broad body and a prehensile or opposable tail that is used as a fifth limb. They have small, sharp, and blunt teeth. Possums are marsupials, which means that they have a pouch on their bellies in which to carry their young. Possums are mostly nocturnal and are very good climbers. Their long, flat, brown or grey coat blends perfectly into the surroundings and their camouflage is very effective. The main difference between possum and possum is their diet. Possums are mostly arboreal (living in trees), but their diet is made mainly of insects, fruit, and vegetables. As for the possums or possums, they are terrestrial (living on the ground) and their diet mainly consists of grains, seeds and sometimes insects and small vertebrates. 7.

        "output": "I am going to try to roast a pig at home for Thanksgiving this year. What equipment and techniques do I need to successfully get a pig roasted?\nNope, there's no specialized cooker for pork. The big difference between poultry and meats like pork, lamb, and beef is that the latter don't have the high moisture content of chicken and fish. So if you cook a pork roast in a bag, it'll never become quite \"fall off the bone\" tender, and, in fact, the inside will become pretty dry if it's overcooked. So there's no need to cook a lamb or pork chop in a bag. Just like you do with chicken breasts, the best way to cook larger cuts of pork and ribs is to cook them in a pan over medium heat with a little bit of oil. You don't need to cover the pan, just poke the meat every few minutes to keep it from burning, and after an hour or so it should be perfect. It's a shame that our grandmothers weren't able to share their secrets with us, but trust me that you'll be happier, and eat better, if you just cook your meats properly.\nTags: Roasting Tips, Meat,\nRobert from Crescent City\nThe way I do it is, I take a 3 lb. chunk of pork, let it sit for 24 hours, place it in a Ziploc bag, and then put a lot of garlic, salt, pepper, and paprika in the bag. I seal the bag tight, and then place it in a crock pot. I cover the crock pot, and cook it for about 3-4 hours on high. I have a lot of fun cooking with my friends and relatives with this. We even take it to community and school functions and cook it up for everyone!\nBrian from New York\nI got sick when my mother tried to cook a pork loin by wrapping it in foil. It had a lot of spices in it like cinnamon and cloves along with brown sugar. I took the foil off the meat and put it in a oven rack with a little olive oil and kosher salt. Cooked at 400 degrees for about an hour and a half with my mother watching it the whole time. It turned out spectacular.\nRenaldo from Riverside\nHonestly, i've not tried this, I'm a vegetarian, but, i've made a few turkeys (just buy the frozen ones). I didn't buy the giblets to make stock/stew with, just the turkey. It's about 11pm, i have it defrosting. I'll wake up in an hour to cook it on my stove. I want to know where i can get extra stuff to make gravy. Also should i make one with oil or just butter?\nKathryn from Las Vegas\nPork is pretty much lean meat that can be dry and tough, so you won't get the nice juicy result that cooking a chicken breast in a bag or pan will give. You can try to cut out the dryness by using meat tenderizer or a marinade to give the fat some flavor. If you really want to tenderize it, you can try to bake it at around 400 degrees first and then put it on low steam for about an hour. This will make it even more tender and give you that great delicious bite. You can also try putting the meat straight into a foil packet filled with onions, garlic, spices, and wine or butter. If you want to do more complicated recipes, you might want to try a smoker or grill but you can also try stuffing your pork with seasonings and other goodies to make it more interesting.\nMichael from San Bernardino\nIt's all in how you prepare the meat. I was out of town for two weeks and I had my roommate cook my pork steak but he forgot to turn on the heat on the grill so when I got back to my apartment there was an over cooked crispy layer of meat with undercooked inside so I decided to cook it myself. I bought a pork loin and trimmed off all the excessive layer of fat that way the meat had the correct amount of fat that you need with a pork loin that has more fat than the others. I put it in a large Ziplock baggie, sprinkle a couple"

When they get close, the Earth's magnetic field pushes them north or south, depending on which hemisphere you are in, into the atmosphere where they collide with the gases.\nWhat are the Northern Lights? The Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, are a spectacular light show in the night sky caused by particles of solar energy. When the solar energy particles approach Earth, they are pushed by its magnetic field into the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.\nThe Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, occurs when solar winds collide with Earth‚Äôs magnetic field ‚Äî creating a shimmering green and blue light show. Scientists are still studying the impact of solar storms, which can temporarily weaken Earth‚Äôs magnetic field and cause the northern lights to brighten.\nCauses of the Northern Lights. Solar activity, or space weather, can affect the magnetic field on Earth, which can interfere with communication satellites in orbit or even harm power grids. An extended period of high solar activity can cause the northern lights to intensify, while a solar minimum can dampen the activity, making the lights appear less often.\nThe northern lights, or aurora borealis, occur in the skies above Earth's northern hemisphere. They can also be referred to as the northern lights ‚Äî or, less commonly, as polar lights ‚Äî aurora polaris or aurora australis. The northern lights are caused by solar activity, and occur when charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's magnetic field near our planet's polar regions .\nNature's most beautiful lights show, the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis, occurs only in the high latitudes like Iceland, Scandinavia or Alaska. It happens when solar particles collide with gaseous particles in the earth's atmosphere.\nAstronomers, meanwhile, are still studying the phenomena which cause the northern lights to appear, and believe that some may be connected to powerful energy bursts from solar storms that reach Earth.\nWhere are the northern lights? The Northern Lights can take place just about anywhere on Earth, from the Arctic Circle to the northernmost parts of the United States. The farther north you can get, the better chance you have of seeing them.\nNorthern Lights. The northern lights illuminate the sky in vivid shades of green, red and pink.

        "output": "I am going to make pumpkin pie for the first time.  Can you help me? Is it difficult to make?? I really like your site !! =  Thank you!!!!\nDear Pumpkin Pie Queen:\nI'm glad you like my pumpkin pie recipe. The only thing more difficult than making pumpkin pie is making a good one.\nI've tried scores of different recipes and only one has managed to produce the tender-crisp, flavorful, and delicious pie of my youthful dreams. The only catch is that it requires a pumpkin that is 2 pounds in weight.\nThe recipe begins with your choice of salt: kosher, fine, or coarse. If you prefer the coarsest salt, you won't need much salt, but for every 10 pounds of ground pumpkin, you should mix in 3 tablespoons of salt. You may use fine or kosher salt if you prefer it, but the results will be saltier. And unless you've got a whole lot of money for high-quality salt, this pie will have way too much salt unless you go with a big ol' hunk of finely-ground Morton's coarse salt.\nThe most-common ingredients that you find in most recipes are canned pumpkin and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, etc.). As I learned in many early failures, you don't want to cut these spices too fine. If you're going with commercial spices, it'll probably cost you $5-$6 to get a 5-oz package of dry spices (a can of pumpkin, to contrast, will cost you $1-$2 at the grocery store).\nOne of the ingredients that no-one thinks about is the pie-flavoring, usually an extract (sugared essence of fruit or spices) or flavor. I know that most recipes will say \"You can omit the flavoring if you wish, but I would suggest a teaspoon of vanilla extract.\" I have never yet used flavoring in a pumpkin pie recipe, but since they are now making pumpkin flavored extract and flavor I suppose it's time to try it. The most popular recipe I've found on the internet so far calls for a full teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (this is a mixture of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and other spices), and 2 full teaspoons of vanilla extract. Another popular recipe, on a site that sells the ingredients, does not use any flavoring or spice. For all of these recipes, each calls for sugar (the usual recipe uses 1.5 cups), milk (1 cup), and eggs (4).\nIn the case of all of my failures (and it's been many), there have been one or more points where I've changed my mind about some part or component of the recipe, such as whether to add a pinch or a tablespoon of this or that, and they've all ended up bad. One of the most crucial elements of my recipe is the use of sugar instead of corn syrup. As soon as I started using corn syrup, my pies started turning out lumpy and gritty.\nThe technique for making the pie crust is crucial to getting what I would call a tender-crisp (tender but not soggy, and crisp but not hard) pie. Most recipes call for using a lot of butter, which is usually spread out at the beginning of the recipe, a technique that gives a flat, craggy sort of crust, rather than one with the tiny pock marks like this: (the ones on either end are the edges of the dough). I recommend using 1 cup butter, 1 cup flour, and 2 cups of ice cold water instead of the typical 3 cups of flour and 1 cup water. This will give you a softer, slightly denser crust that will hold its shape when baked. This technique also results in more crunchy crust, which many people prefer. But if that's not your preference, you can use a couple of tablespoons of extra flour (that's a bit of powdered sugar in there, too). This will create a softer and sticky crust that bakes into a gummy, chewy crust that you still won't want all that much. But it'd be easier if you had a pumpkin weighing in at 24 pounds"

What is the Truth about Atlantis?\nWhat is the True History of Atlantis?\nWhat is the Connection between Atlantis and Lemuria?\nWhere was Atlantis?\nWhat is the Truth about Atlantis?\nAtlantis was a civilization that lived on Earth more than 12,000 years ago. Some speculate that its location was in the Atlantic Ocean near the Azores or Gibraltar or off the coast of Yucatan, Mexico. Others suggest that it was located near Egypt, Greece, Bimini, or the Azores.\nThe earliest written references to Atlantis date back to 9600 BC. They were recorded by the Sumerians and survived in the cuneiform tablets in the city of Erech. Sumerians were the first humans to develop written language and were believed to be the ancestors of Egyptian and Hebrew civilizations. Many texts and legends that follow describe Atlantis as a flourishing land located in a distant western paradise, inhabited by a thriving civilization that had excellent architecture, sophisticated mathematics and astronomy, and a highly evolved spiritual culture. The Atlanteans were believed to have worshipped many gods, as well as their own ancestors who inhabited Atlantis before them. As such, they were said to be more advanced spiritually than many other early cultures.\nLegends of Atlantis describe the civilization as a utopian nation ruled by a divine king. Plato tells a story of King Atlas and Queen Poseidonis, who ruled Atlantis for more than two hundred years before the civilization was destroyed by two catastrophic natural disasters. The first catastrophe was the shifting of the Earth‚Äôs axis and resulted in a large portion of the continent sinking underwater.\nThe second disaster originated from within the civilization itself, which involved a coup d‚Äô√©tat led by the tyrannical brother of King Atlas. According to Plato, Atlas and his wife fled with their sons. Poseidonis and her sons then built a new land in the Western Hemisphere, where they later established Atlantis.\nPlato believed that before the sinking, the earthlings had already been prepared for a new life by God and received instructions to look for an island that would later provide them a haven to survive. This instruction was revealed prior to the disasters. This might explain why one third of Atlantis‚Äô population still managed to survive the cataclysm, which was believed to have been caused by Earth‚Äôs destruction of its outer layer. However, according to Plato, this did not happen instantaneously. Instead, it took a great deal of time‚Äîapproximately a month or a year‚Äîfor the land‚Äôs resources to be consumed by the sea.\nAtlantis was later visited by a man named Hermes Trismegistus, who led a team of scientists and philosopher-kings to the land. The name ‚ÄúHermes Trismegistus‚Äù is said to have originated in the Greek, which mean ‚ÄúHermes the Thrice Great.‚Äù The legendary figure of Hermes is identified with several deities in ancient Greek, Roman, and Hellenistic mythology and religion, including the Greek god of wit and thievery, Hermes. In Hellenistic Egypt, he became the god who taught humankind to become immortal in death, and his doctrine was later adopted by the Neoplatonists.\nPlato relates to us that when Hermes Trismegistus visited Atlantis, he discovered and studied books of the lost ancient wisdom of human civilizations. He was the last recorded person to see Atlantis before it vanished. Many other myths and legends about Atlantis tell stories of the inhabitants‚Äô technological advances and great power. According to legend, their technology greatly surpassed that used in modern nations today. Their ships could travel long distances, and many scientists believe that they may have had the ability to travel to the moon long before modern nations discovered their capabilities. Some even speculate that the Atlanteans could have been astronauts who came to explore the stars and bring back messages from the planet on which they were from, just like in the modern movie ‚ÄúInterstellar.‚Äù\nIt is not clear why Atlantis did not survive. Some say that it was a natural disaster, while others believe it was a divine intervention. However, Plato tells a different story regarding the destruction of Atlantis."

        "instruction": "How did mankind discover that the earth was spherical, and why did they initially believe it to be flat?",
        "output": "How did mankind discover that the earth was spherical, and why did they initially believe it to be flat? The idea of the earth being spherical in shape was not first widely recognized by mankind. When did people first learn that the earth was round? The shape of the earth was first widely recognized by ancient civilizations. A sphere is a shape that encloses all of its points the same distance from its center. The earth has a spherical shape because it rotates on its axis while spinning on its axis and traveling through outer space. These are called laws of physics. The earliest evidence of spherical shape was found in ancient Sumer, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. A sphere-shaped earth is described throughout these civilizations. For example, a Sumerian text that survived until ancient Greece is a description of a spherical earth. The text describes the sea or ocean surrounding the earth, which was known to be an extremely large mass of water. This description, with the help of the other evidence, makes the case for the spherical shape of the earth. Sumerian evidence suggests that the spherical shape of the earth was understood more than 4,000 years ago. It is important for us to know these facts, because in ancient civilizations some people had different ideas about these facts. They would have believed that the earth was a large sphere or globe with the waters surrounding it and that the sun, moon, and stars all seemed to be moving around it as it rotated above the waters. The earliest civilizations, although they understood the spherical shape of the earth, believed that the heavenly bodies, which include the sun, the moon. and some of the planets, were actually travelers or gods that were actually traveling over the earth. The ancients explained the shape of the earth in various ways. These ways were based on their knowledge of the human world. The oldest known description of the spherical shape of the earth comes from ancient Sumer in modern-day Iraq. This country was the first to develop writing. It is therefore the first civilization that left a historical record of its achievements. Although not all of the ancient Sumerian records have survived, those that have been preserved include extensive mathematical texts as well as texts dealing with astronomy, cosmology, and ancient medicine. They also include some of the oldest surviving astronomical and geographical texts known to man. The oldest of these texts was written by Sumerians during the third and fourth millennia BC, and its title meant The Way of Heaven. This meant that the Sumerians were aware of the movement of heavenly bodies and their influence on earth as early as the fourth millennium BC, and in fact this was when the earth was first recognized as a globe. This implies that the Sumerians knew the spherical shape of the earth more than 4,000 years ago. The most extensive text dealing with astronomy, cosmology, and ancient medicine was written by the Babylonians, who were Sumerian descendants and succeeded them as the rulers of Mesopotamia. They lived in the present Iraq from 1450 BC to 1150 BC and developed the mathematics of geometry, which is based on the geometric concept of straight lines, angles, circles, and areas. The name the Babylonians gave to their geometry text, which is also the oldest mathematics textbook in the world, referred to The Mathematical Textbook of the Enumeration of Asta, which is based on the number 60. For each number from six to 60. the textbook describes the length of lines, which are called sticks. and the angles formed when they are brought together. A line is a straight path that runs from one place to another. A straight line is one that does not bend or turn, and it does not change its direction. From the first line to the sixth line in the textbook there are two sticks that form six angles. This explains the numbers six to ten, but they form only two angles instead of three as is the case with the three-sided triangle, which is one angle. In this manner, the textbook shows that for the first ten numbers from six to fifty. there are a total of nine sticks and nine angles. In other words, each number in this textbook has two sticks. The same number has two angles except for the number ten, which has only one angle. The tenth line has two sticks and its angles are equal, whereas the number eleven has one stick and its angle is different. The textbook shows that the number twelve has three sticks and its angles are different. The textbook also shows that each number increases the number of sticks to which each angle is equal. This means that for the number twenty to the number sixty."

        "output": "Why did humans evolve to believe in God? Is there a God? If there is, how can an omniscient, omnipotent, omniprescient being let evil exist in the world, or at least, let it be so prevalent? If there is no God, who or what is responsible for our existence, and for our consciousness?\nOn some level, every one of us grapples with existential questions.\nIt‚Äôs a good thing these questions are at the forefront of our minds. As a matter of fact, I can tell you exactly why humans have evolved to ask existential questions‚Äîbecause those who do not, end up as a matter of course, on the wrong side of evolution.\nThe human species is a very, very curious animal. And it‚Äôs the curiosity that leads us to ask questions, such as the ones I‚Äôve raised. This natural curiosity is the foundation of science. But science is more than curiously asking questions and attempting to answer them through the scientific method. Science also requires an open, non-judgmental mind to come to any conclusion whatsoever. No agenda or axe to grind can be permitted by the serious researcher, which is why science is able to evolve so fast, in such short periods of time.\nIn the same way, the human mind finds it interesting (although more complicated than that) why we are here and what we are here for. And, to answer that question, we require a non-prejudiced, open mind. We need to ask questions and listen for and carefully consider all the answers, not just those that we are comfortable with.\nOur non-judgmental mind has allowed us to discover great, new things, such as the theory of evolution (the fact that all life evolved from a single life-form), the theory of relativity (that space and time are not absolute, but are relative to each other), and quantum theory (that objects can be both particles and waves).\nSadly, however, the mind with the pre-conceived ideas, is not usually able to come up with anything of great value. When we are closed off, we are unable to learn or grow, and so we either stop asking, or only ask questions that are convenient or easy to answer.\nBut, the good news is that the human mind can evolve just as we do, and just as our animal ancestors have. The ability to evolve does exist within us, but we can only become open minded if we actively work at it. And the first and most important step is to be able to let go of the pre-conceived notions and our own biases.\nEssentially, we need to forget that we are human beings. The human species itself is a very, very complex one. And when we look at it from an outsider‚Äôs perspective, i.e. from the perspective of an extraterrestrial alien, we realize that we are both very intelligent and yet our mindsets are incredibly limited, primitive and biased.\nWe see everything, such as religion, politics, and everything in between, through our own limited biases. Our biases make us think that we are right, and everyone who disagrees with us is wrong. This limited perspective of ours is what stands in the way of true evolution both of our species and of our mind.\nIt‚Äôs only when we realize this that we can begin work at becoming open, non-judgmental, non-prejudicial people. We can then begin work at evolving so that we become aware of the true power and potential that lies within each of us and within our mind."

What were the ancient Chinese known for?\nWhy do we have a solar season and a lunar month?\nWhy does the moon look bigger, fuller and bigger every day?\nWhy it's the longest lunar month at full moon and new moon and shortest at the equinox and solstice?\nHow do we date our lunar month and time in our calendar system?\nWhy does the full moon have such a big impact on us?\nWHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO RECEIVE YOUR PERSONAL MOONS DETAILS?\nOnce you have ordered your personal details, it's time for our team to get out the books and do all the hard work for you, making sure every single detail is correct and accurate. They will then set about collating all of the knowledge they have gleaned from the years of experience we have here and creating a detailed, written personal report that you can take and treasure forever. You will then receive a brand new moon calendar (if you did not already get one from your birthday gift pack) along with this personal information report.\nBy the time you've done all this you'll be feeling like you've discovered the secrets to the universe.\nBUT HOW DO I KNOW IF IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT?\nThere's no way we could get the very exact moon details for anyone, at any time, but your team really know what they are doing. They have all read through a lot of the ancient text and have gleaned all sorts of information which they cross reference with the current lunar cycle and make sure they are very accurate.\nWe're giving away our knowledge to you for nothing, so why would we have any incentive to make mistakes or let the details not be exactly right. Everything we have given you here is the best we can provide and we hope you truly take advantage of the information and guidance on your personal moon calendar.\nWHAT IF I DON‚ÄôT HAVE ANY PLANETS AND THE MOON IS ALL I HAVE?\nYou don't need any other planets to have the moon calendar, in fact, if you have a lot of other planet information, it could take away the focus you wish to have on the moon. Each birth detail is specific to you and your current status, from the moment you were born.\nYour astrological birth chart contains your birth date, time and place and is calculated to give you your own unique birth chart. The moon calendar looks at the phases of the moon at the time you were born and uses your birth chart to look at the specific moon that was rising in the east when you were born. This is then compared to see what influence your moon phase has on you as an individual person.\nYou will always be able to look back over your moon calendar detail and remember your birthday in this way. Birthdays will forever be special to you in their own unique way because you were born on that day at the time that moon was rising over that particular place (Earth at that precise time).\nYou also receive a full moon calendar every year for life after you receive your birthday present and you can look back at the full moons on your birthday and see how they correspond with what's happening in your life.\nThere is also some information in your personal lunar moon calendar that includes the full moons. In ancient times, farmers and others would look at the full moons in the calendar to help plan their planting for the good earth and soil conditions. This is an ancient superstition that some still hold for this particular moon, especially on their birthday.\nYou will also find additional dates showing in the calendar that will give you some valuable information about your birthday and the days leading up to it as well as days leading up to the new moon. This information could prove to be extremely valuable to you when you look back at the dates that you receive in the birthday gift pack.\nThis could be used in conjunction with the full moon in that calendar, as it will give you a very good indication as to how long the moons in that particular calendar will take to pass and where they will all be at the specific time of your birthday.\nWHAT WILL EVERYONE THINK WHEN THEY FIND OUT I'M BORN ON A MOON CALANDAR?\nEveryone will think just one thing - What a wonderful birthday present. There has always been a fascination with the moon, as it's one of the few permanent objects in our skies that we can see night and day all around the world. There will be thousands of people that still remember watching the first man walk on the moon and feel the same now that they are still expl"

I bought it around 2010 and was really excited when I had finally managed to buy a copy of it. For three months, I tried hard to play it and find out what it was all about and I just couldn‚Äôt really get into it and it was only a couple months into 2011 when I finally got a chance to play it! I beat it, but I still didn‚Äôt get to finish the side quests and the DLC. I don‚Äôt even like the characters in the game much. I just have never really done it either. I‚Äôve never really played RPG‚Äôs either, but just hearing that we could get a trailer for the fifth installment of the Elder Scrolls series has gotten me REALLY excited and I‚Äôm hoping that it gets released this year or next! I can‚Äôt wait!\nI just checked, and the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for the Xbox is the best selling game on Amazon for the Xbox and the PS3 version is also ranked on the list and is only behind the Kinect and some newer releases that have just come out. The game itself has sold really well since it‚Äôs release and the hype behind it is really intense as well! I personally think the new Elder Scrolls game will come out this year, either in November like the 4th game, then again in December for the holidays, or even this coming Summer! The game has already been in development for a few years now, so I think that Zenimax/Bethesda knows as a company that they can make a good amount of money selling this game and I would be suprised if it doesn‚Äôt come out this year at all. I will admit that at the moment, I don‚Äôt even consider myself an Elder Scrolls fan, but I would love to get into the series and the more that gets released for it, the more I look into it. I heard that there are a lot of other games being developed as well, but I don‚Äôt know if those will be released with the new Elder Scrolls game, but if so, then more the merrier to me! I guess we will have to wait and see and hopefully, we will get some new information soon on when the game will be released along with a trailer to get us even more excited about it!\nI think this generation of gaming will be remembered for two games, GTA V and the new Elder Scrolls for the PS3 and Xbox 36"

Thanks.\nComment: Hi there,\nI have never had fl√¶skesteg, but here is a great website that lists the recipe for it as well as others, including rye bread, open-faced sandwiches and sm√∏rrebr√∏d (Danish bread).\nhttp://www.clausen.com/recipes/dishes/flaskesteg.html\nI have never had a \"real\" sm√∏rebr√∏d from Denmark, only from Iceland (honey and butter) and other places than a Danish pastry shop, so I cannot help you there.\nComment: In my home as a child, we would have fl√¶skesteg one or twice a year. We would place salted pork on a slab of marble and chisel the fat away. We would then let it sit in the smoker for a few hours until it turned a beautiful dark red/brown color. It never tasted quite as good to me as bacon, but it was always interesting to eat.\nComment: Hi there, thanks for your comment. I was very curious when I got your e-mail, and I had never heard of this kind of dish until I got your request for recipes, and I am learning more. I never heard of fl√¶skesteg or bacon until I was an adult, and I learned something very new. I'll do my best to find it and make it - my wife will like that!\nComment: My great grandmother made these when she used live pigs and salted them to hang in the smoke house. Grand father had to get it down to the smoke house and she had to clean and cook the pig. It was a family event. She would make a rye roll (sourdough made with rye flour) or one of her special \"lardy breads\". We don't make it anymore, but would make \"salted pork\" (sorry I don't have a recipe) It is very different from bacon and very good!\nComment: Hey, Just wondering if you have ever tasted any smoked ham or ham from a smoked/ cured style....it was absolutely delicious and there is nothing I like better than some good old fashioned ham for dinner. Were you aware that ham in it's traditional style was prepared differently than the ham in groceries today? I am not sure of this, but it is supposed to be salted on the outside and hung to cure before being prepared. You wouldn't see this method of preparation around much today. It was a big part of our diet when I was a kid...we never had store bought processed meat...we took it upon ourselves to cure our own and the resulting product was wonderful...if you have any information about this, it would be appreciated.\nComment: \"Fl√¶skesteg, which is really a type of cooked ham, was traditionally cut from salted pork that had been hanging in the smoke house over burning wood. These days, most people buy pork already cooked in the grocery store and use other methods other than hanging it.\"\nComment: The most typical smoking or curing of pork in Denmark was fl√¶skesteg (pork slices smothered in salt). The Danish would salt pork and let it dry for a few months. I don't think that it was cooked, rather preserved. It was then packaged to be sold, and eaten dry by the poor.\nComment: Thanks so much for the great information. I'm really looking forward to making some.\nComment: Hi,I am interested in this and I would appreciate if you would be able to email me directions as I couldn't find this site when I click on it.Also could you advise me if you can also obtain the traditional smoking wood and is it available in England?Thanks in advance.\nAnswer: Hi, sorry for the delay, I forgot to check on this a couple of times. I will go ahead and email you the directions and as far as I know a smoking wood is the wood that is used to smoke other things and it is hard to find, I have only ever seen it sold by wood craft stores, some people say that they have tried it, but not too much success.

        "output": "Please tell me about the romantic relationship between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. As I said above, Caesar had an affair with Cleopatra sometime during their rule. I don't believe that Caesar considered the relationship as anything more than a physical one. His affairs were often physical, yet he only maintained one relationship that was longstanding: with his friend and aide Gaius Maecenas, whom he always trusted more than anyone else. In addition, Caesar had no heirs and he wished very much to have a male heir. By 34 BC, he and Cleopatra had a one-year-old son together, called Caesarion. Caesar also fathered two sons, both of whom died at an early age: Gaius Julius Caesar and Julia Caesaris. In early 30 BC, Caesar died, apparently from natural causes. Cleopatra also died soon after - again, of causes unknown. This leads most modern researchers to believe that they died by means of suicide because they had learned that their relationship was not accepted by the Roman Senate and they had seen what happened to Mark Antony. The Roman people (the citizens of Rome) thought very little of Caesarion. They only really recognized Caesarion as the son of Caesar (not as the daughter of Cleopatra). His mother was considered disgusting and vile, and therefore her son could not really be considered legitimate. Most of his citizenship rights were not enforced and Caesarion (along with his mother) quickly faded from public view. Most of what we know about Caesarion comes from the writings of his mother. It was Cleopatra who wrote a series of love letters to Caesar, expressing her sorrow at their separation and describing her dreams of a life together with Caesar in Rome. Because of this, Cleopatra is often thought of as the \"true\" love of Caesar's life, although there is absolutely no factual evidence for this. However, the fact remains that Caesar did care deeply about the son he believed to be his own. In an ancient parchment, he wrote a lengthy tribute to Caesarion, explaining how proud he was of his son. How can I find evidence about Julius Caesar? There are numerous websites dedicated to Julius Caesar. On Google, I suggest the following: www.juliuscaesar.org www.bartleby.com Also look on Yahoo Answers, Wikipedia, and any other reliable sites. Are there other sources to cite in my research paper? Yes. These sources will give you other points of view: www.bbc.co.uk/history http;//www.sparknotes.com http;//www.themysteriousof.co.uk http;//www.answers.com/topic/julius-caesar Are there other questions that you may have about Julius Caesar? Do not hesitate to ask your questions and I will do my best to answer them as soon as possible!\nCan I make a research paper on Julius Caesar?\nCan I write a research paper on Julius Caesar? Of course you can! Julius Caesar is an extremely interesting person and a fascinating historical figure; I truly recommend him! I just wrote a blog about Caesar, so check it out for more ideas.\nWhy is Julius Caesar so important for society? Because he helped to unite much of the world at that time. He conquered many countries and cities and thereby helped to unite people previously divided by their religion, ethnicity or political beliefs.\nCan Caesar help in any way? Perhaps, if I can get my hands on a book from the 19th century or later... Otherwise, I doubt it. However, why don't you simply look for information about Caesar on the Internet or write me a message and I can give you some suggestions on where to look?\nWhat year was Julius Caesar born? He was born in the 1st Century BC, probably around 100 BC. He died in 44 BC.\nHow long was Julius Caesar king? He was King of Rome for only 10 months. The Senate put him on trial for his numerous perceived crimes (or perhaps simply for being too powerful and unpredictable). Caesar was forced to leave Rome in 49 BC and then, 10 months later, he was assassinated in March of 44 BC.\nDo you have any pictures of Julius Caesar? There are very few authentic photos of Julius Caesar, since he died almost 2,000 years ago, but there are a LOT of pictures about him. Here are some examples:"

By adding these basic ingredients to a Bloody Mary Mix, you then add the basic elements of what makes a Bloody Mary. You see, a Bloody Mary is more than just a glass of tomato juice that has a little bit of spice added to it. A real Bloody Mary is packed with flavor!\nAdding Flavor Factors\nWe're going to list all the basic ingredients. We're also going to list some flavor factors that can improve a Bloody Mary. These are things like peppers, pickles, celery and cucumbers. Spices such as hot pepper sauce, a few drops of hot sauce, garlic and seasoning salt are also options. To enhance the flavor of your Bloody Mary, try blending these additives together and stir this blend into your basic Bloody Mary mix.\nA Bloody Mary Mix with Spices\nTry adding spices to the basic Bloody Mary mix. You can add black pepper, cayenne pepper, ground cumin, hot pepper sauce, and a little bit of cinnamon. If you like your Bloody Mary with a little bit of heat, add some sliced jalape√±o peppers, minced fresh garlic and hot pepper sauce. These spices will add quite a bit of kick to your Bloody Mary.

We recommend serving your Bloody Marys with a large block of ice; just be sure that the bloody mary mix and the ice never touch each other! This might melt the ice block a little bit, but don't worry about it. Keep in mind that the drink may appear cloudy for a while, but you will not lose any flavor. If you don't use a block of ice, use a glass that's pre-chilled in the fridge, then add the ingredients.\nAdd the Bloody Mary mix to the glass or can.\nStir thoroughly until the flavors combine and the drink forms a bright red color.\nIf you like, float garnishes on top like celery or cheese with olives or pickles on the side. If you are serving this Bloody Mary Mix recipe to children, reduce the amount of vodka to about one and a half ounces.\nIf the mixture looks too thin the day of serving, just add a little bit of powdered sugar for a slightly sweeter taste.\nServing Size 8 oz; Serves 2\nTo prepare the dried mushrooms, soak the dried mushrooms in 1 cup boiling water for 45 minutes.

There are special urns that are designed to carry ashes, these will be stronger and better than ones that were developed for disposal.\nWhat is the best way to scatter ashes of my grandfather?\nIt would depend on the circumstances of the death, and whether other members of your family were also cremated and want to have their ashes scattered alongside him. You could choose to have him buried, or bury his cremated remains with him if he is buried. There are also lots of ideas to \"spread\" cremated remains that are often chosen in more informal funerals. Another option is to‚Ä¶\nAsked in Relationships, Marriage, Divorce, Children\nWhat is the best way to split up divorced property if it was spread throughout several different locations?\nAs a married couple you would share everything and this is the same reason why in a divorce or separation this is done as well. In the event that one party takes the children then the parties will split the remaining property, debt and liabilities.\nIf there were no children or if the party remarries then the assets will most likely be divided 50/50.\nThe division of assets should then be negotiated between the two parties.

        "output": "I've read the book \"The Twelve Caesars\" by Suetonius, a few times. I'm curious about the context, of when he wrote.\nSo, which is the most accurate translation?\nI've heard that most translations are somewhat inaccurate. There are many errors, and there is much that is left out or added. It really depends on what you are trying to find out. For instance, if you want to know what the original text said when he praised his wife, then you read the original. This does not mean that the original is more likely to be accurate than the English translations. In fact, the opposite probably holds true. English translations of ancient Greek or ancient Egyptian for instance, are almost certainly more reliable and more precise than translations into modern languages, such as Latin.\nAnother big difference is cultural perspective. In ancient times, the ancient peoples of Africa, Europe, and Asia had very different ideas about what \"love\" and marriage meant. This is why you see love being expressed very differently, depending on which language you are reading. The ancient people of Greece and Rome for instance, considered marriage to be an arrangement that had certain advantages that we would not recognize.\nI think that it is always best to compare versions from different times and from different languages and cultures. I would not say that one translation is more accurate than another, I think it is more a matter of cultural perspective. Even if the English translation reads very differently, and includes things not included in other translations, this doesn't mean that the English translation is in any way wrong or inaccurate in any way. Even when one translation reads more negatively than another, like Suetonius, this doesn't mean that it is in any way wrong or inaccurate. Translations into different languages, and translations from different eras can both be useful approaches. Whenever possible, I'd like to read a translation into English from the same time period as the original was written.\nThere will always be translations that are more accurate than others. Sometimes this depends on the time they were written or on the expertise of the translator. The most accurate translations, however, usually take into account the cultural perspective. If you read a translation from one culture into another, and you can't tell which language was the original or which language was translated from, then probably the translation is right on target. It is inaccurate only to the degree to which the language itself is inaccurate. This is why it is really important to compare translations from different eras, different peoples, and different languages. You may find that an ancient translation is quite accurate, but it is translated into more modern English, and some things are lost in translation.\nI think you will find that most translations are fairly close and very accurate. I'm not sure there is one that is more accurate than another, though there are obviously translations that are more up to date than others. The translator does his best to take into account the differences between languages, and so you really can't say that one translation is more accurate than another. In any case, if you can get two different translations that are very different from each other, you can probably safely assume that the differences between the two translations reflect the different cultures of their writers. If the translations are very similar, then it probably means that the original language was very similar to the one that the translation was written in."

        "output": "Please tell me the history of Walt Disney. I really would like to know the history of this studio. But there isn't any info or website that gives much info. About the history of Walt Disney. Thank you!\nWe know that Walt Disney' Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Elias Disney, worked as a railroad builder, and Mary Disney was homemaker.\nWalt Disney's career began when he moved from Chicago to Hollywood in the early 1920s to try his luck as an animator. That's when Disney began making small animated short films featuring his famous creation, Oswald the Rabbit.\nAfter an unfortunate falling out with Universal Studios, The Walt Disney Company began its production in 1928 with the film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Not long after, in December 1929, Walt Disney formed The Walt Disney Company, Inc. Disney‚Äôs first full length animated feature, Fantasia, was released in 1940, followed a year later by Pinocchio and Dumbo in 1941.\nThe Walt Disney studio released its first full length animated feature. Bambi was released in 1942, followed by The Princess and the Frog in 2009, Mulan in 1998 and Winnie the Pooh in 1977. The Walt Disney Company has produced over 500 feature films including 12 original stories.\nSince 1967, The Walt Disney Company has released 40 animated feature films. That's when Walt Disney's daughter, Diane Disney Miller, brought in her husband, Ron Miller in an attempt to revitalize the Disney company.\nIn 1995, Disney purchased Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. For over $19 billion. When Ron Miller retired in 1984, his son-in-law, Michael Eisner, became CEO and Chairman of the Board of the Walt Disney Company.\nThen, from December 1996 through August 2002, Disney acquired Pixar Animation Studios, which brought such movies as Toy Story, A Bug's Life and Monsters, Inc.\nIn November 2006, the Walt Disney Company sold its ABC Publishing Group, which includes magazine assets such as Teen Beat, Disney Adventures, and YM. At the same time, Disney acquired Starcom MediaVest Group (SMC), a leading media buying company.\nIn March 2007, Disney sold ABC Family (formerly Fox Family Channel) to CMC Group for $1.3 billion, however it kept ABC Entertainment and ABC Daytime. Disney now owns ESPN the Magazine, launched in May 1998, Go.com, Disney Online, Radio Disney, Disney's ABC Cable Network Group, Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC FAMILY, Lifetime Television, A&E Network and History Channel. In addition, Disney will open Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005.\nWow! That's a lot! Any more questions?\nI have one more question actually.. What is Bob Iger's Job Title At Disney?\nAww man! I'm sorry I can't give you the exact title, but a quick Google search will get you to the site he works at. http://www.bobiger.com/ Here's the description of the company: The Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is a leading diversified international family entertainment and media enterprise with the following business segments: media networks, parks and resorts, studio entertainment, consumer products and interactive media. Their goal is to exceed shareholder expectations and provide employees an exceptional work environment! That's a lot! I hope my question helped!\nThank you so much! I didn't even know about Bob Iger yet!\nIf anyone has any questions I know that it'd be no problem to answer! I hope we can learn more about Disney!\nThank you again! And a big thank you to Disney Fanatic too! Thanks guys!\nGreat question! I also have this question! Anyone..?\nYou're very welcome..I hope it helped! I tried finding some good sites about Walt Disney. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any good sites. The sites I have now are either not updated or just incomplete. I also have more questions. But unfortunately, I don't think any Disney Fanatic's will notice any more posts about the history of Walt Disney..\nThanks so much!"

        "instruction": "How do I make apple juice?",
        "output": "How do I make apple juice?\nIn case you don‚Äôt mind tasting a bit of alcohol, then you can attempt this alcohol concentration method. Take apple juice and pour it into a glass, then add vodka or whiskey. Allow for a few hours of time where the sugar gets converted back into alcohol. Then, strain the extract through a cheesecloth to make it purer and strain it again through a coffee filter to make it pure. The result is apple juice with some alcohol in it, which can be used in mixed with some other drink to make it stronger.\nCan apple juice be fermented at home?\nMost apple juice is 8 % alcohol, which is great for a low-alcohol drink. But if you want a drink that is higher in alcohol content then you can try fermenting the apple juice for a few days to make it an alcoholic beverage that is close to wine. In fact, if you let the fermented apple juice sit for a couple of weeks, you might end up with a tasty cider that resembles a bittersweet wine. This can give you many options of how you make apple juice when you choose to home brew it.\nHow to make apple juice from apples?\nIt does not matter if you cut the apples directly and use them in your preparation of apple juice or just grate the apples in a bowl. What matters is that their skins must be intact. Once you have prepared them, it is important that you store them properly so that they can last for a while before you use them up. They can be stored in a plastic container or closed bag and kept away from sunlight and heat. For better results, you can try putting them inside an airtight container or even a mason jar. Just make sure that the area around it is well ventilated and keep the apples in a place that is not warm.\nDo you have to peel apple before juicing it?\nWhen it comes to making apple juice, you definitely don‚Äôt have to go through the hassle of peeling all the apple skins. In fact, if you peel all your apples they will most likely end up being stored for a longer period than if you have directly sliced them. It is often seen that apples are juiced only when they have already been peeled in order to keep them fresh for a long time. If you still wish to peel the apples, you can do it as long as you are sure of the timeframe and conditions it has been kept in. Most apple juice concentrate usually is without any peel on it whatsoever because it tends to break down once exposed to heat.\nMostly, it would be a yes if you plan to make apple juice from freshly sliced apples. But make sure that it is well cleaned and thoroughly rinsed before you put it in your blender or juicer.\nWhat is the difference between apple juice concentrate and fresh apple juice?\nApple juice concentrate is basically the de-watered and de-pulped apples that have been extracted and concentrated without the addition of sugar. It does taste similar to apple juice but it is often recommended that you mix it with water or milk. The juice concentrate in its powdered or dry form is generally used for cooking purposes where making a simple apple sauce becomes simple and quick.\nMaking fresh apple juice, on the other hand, requires that you chop the apples and mix them with the other ingredients like water, juicing, etc. There are a lot of benefits associated with fresh fruit juice though most of them are associated from the healthy nature of the fresh fruit juice itself.\nHow to store apple juice?\nOne thing that you have to always keep in mind as per health standards is that you should not keep the apple juice in plastic bottles. Plastic is never a good option as far as preserving the nutritional content of the apple juice is concerned. A better option would be to use an air-tight glass bottle which can keep the apple juice fresh for a longer period. Make sure that you store the apple juice at room temperatures. It is advisable that if you want to keep it for a fairly long period then place it in the refrigerator.\nIs there any difference between the apple juice concentrate and the fresh apple juice?\nIt is true that most apple juice products are sold as apple juice concentrate. And indeed, one of the main reasons for this is that the apple juice concentrate is a cheaper form of the"

        "output": "How can I make bubble solution?\nFirst, place the ingredients one by one in a spatter-proof bowl (see Figure 1). Add hot water and put the top cap on the bowl. Set the bowl aside and let it come to room temperature.\nWhat makes the bubbles?\nBubbles are just like balloons ‚Äì filled with air and light. But there's one big difference. The balloons have a strong plastic bag that holds the air and light in. Bubbles have only thin water to hold the air and light. This means that the bubbles are much softer than balloons.\nThere's another difference between bubbles and balloons. With balloons, it's pretty easy for them to pop. Just put them on their sides, and they'll pop (see Figure 2). Not so with bubbles. Once they form, bubbles will pop only when they come in contact with the opposite charged substance. And while that can happen to an electric bubble wand, it's impossible for this change to happen to an ordinary bubble.\nWhat's the opposite charged substance?\nThe opposite charged substance, or opposite pole, exists for every substance in nature, from water to rocks to hair (see Figure 3).\nIt's called opposite because it is the exact opposite of the substance that we are familiar with. It's not positive or negative, but the same kind of substance, but with a different charge. In bubble terms, it's a hair, a feather, something dry and charged. And since water doesn't have a charge, the opposite pole is opposite to water, that is, something that is like water in terms of charge. So, for example, if a feather is negative, then sea water will be positive. If a hair is positive, then rainwater will be negative.\nFigure 3. The opposite charged substance is the exact opposite of the charged substance.\nWhere would I find the opposite charged substance?\nFirst, you don't find the opposite charged substance, you make it or create it. It is not in the nature, but it is a thing.\nMaking a balloon or a bubble is similar to making a firework or a volcano. You need a charge for it to get started. The same is true for water and electric bubbles. So, you can create electric bubbles by filling a bowl or cup full of water and dipping an electric device, such as a sparkler or a bubble wand, into it as illustrated in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. Filling a bowl full of water and dipping in an electric device will make bubbles.\nFigure 5. Electric device to make bubbles\nThe electric device can be any device that will give you bubbles when dipped in water. Electric bubble wands are made with an electrolysis device and work just like a sparkler, where there is an electrode, typically a wire, which is connected to a power source. But instead of making bright sparks, the wire makes tiny bubbles of water and air at the end where it makes contact with the water. You can fill a bowl full of water, and with each click of the button, a tiny bubble pops out (see Figure 6).\nClicking a bubble wand can do more than just float a bubble. You can also create sparks and lights, or you can combine two water-blowing wands to make even bigger bubbles.\nThere are some other devices like a hair dryer and electric toothbrush that will also produce the same result as a bubble wand ‚Äì tiny bubbles. But the only difference is that the electric bubbles from these other devices will pop more quickly than those from electric bubbles.\nBubble wand, bottle, and bubble solution\nPlace the bottle or bowl upside down or stand it up with the base facing out (see Figure 7). Pour the bubble solution carefully in the bottle or bowl, making sure to not spill.\nFigure 7. Place the bottle or bowl upside down or stand it up with the base facing out. Pour the bubble solution carefully in the bottle or bowl, making sure to not spill.\nThe bubble solution will turn cloudy once the bubbles appear, as it is a combination of water and soap. But don't worry. After a while, it will clear up and become transparent again.\nIf you want to know what chemicals and other elements are in the bubble solution, see the Science Buddies project Giving Water a Surprise"

So if you are thinking of a sweet dessert you can offer to your guests then give the Kammunia below a try, it has simple ingredients and you can prepare it under 30 MN. Do let us know how it goes\n200gr soft cheese\n1/2 cn strawberries\n1.In a food processor mix sugar, salt, strawberries, vanilla and 1/2 of cheese, then spread it in a baking pan and add lemon zest then bake it in a preheated oven at 300F/ 150 C for 20 minutes , then take it out and let it cool down .\n2.To serve use a cone paper baking and put the remaining cheese with the sugar at the bottom then pile the cake with the cheese and put the remaining cheese on top and serve it\nNote: this dessert recipe can't be free of sugar as we should not under-estimate its health benefits. By freeing yourself from sugar can only lead to serious diseases as a result of too many side effects of sugar removal , including anemia, muscle cramps, stomach and immune system malfunction, headaches, mood swings, and even depression. So take sugar cautiously , and do not try to eat it in excess , and most importantly do not forget to eat other foods such as strawberries, bananas, pineapple, and cocoa for example.\nThank you so much for the delicious recipes.

The marinades ingredients are:\n1 lemon and 2 - 3 garlic cloves\n3.5 tablespoon of sweet paprika\n1/2 teaspoon of powdered cumin\nBringing everything together:\nTake a saucepan and boil the red onion, garlic, lemon, and the pepper in it, until you get a saucy consistency, then add all the marinades ingredients to the saucepan and mix them well, leave it to rest in a glass jar for 1 hour, then add the pepper and mix it again, take it out and use it as needed for cooking the chicken.\nTake the chicken, take out the inside organs, and then place this inside the chick, and leave it to rest in a fridge the whole night, then take it out the next morning and marinade it.\nWhen you are ready to cook the chicken (if it is ready) pour some lemon juice over it and then place it in a preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes at 180-200 C and leave it to rest the same night.\nWhen you are ready , take it out the oven and place it on a plate and cut it on small sizes in order to be able to eat it easily and all together.\nThank you so much for this lovely recipe.\nWhen i wanted to visit your country, Tunisia i learned there are no airplanes flying to Tunisia anymore.

The differences between these different types of airplanes mainly depend on their different purposes and how they are used. Airplanes use their different shape, size and function to help them perform better and fulfill their different purposes.\nWant to know more about the different types of airplanes in the skies today? If so, keep reading to learn more about what different types of airplanes are used for and which is the best airplane type.\nAirplanes are designed, constructed and utilized for different purposes in the world today. There are different types of airplanes with various unique purposes. The different types of airplanes you encounter in the skies today may seem similar, but the small differences they have determine how they will be useful for different purposes.\nThe different purposes different types of airplanes are used for will determine how they are designed and how they are constructed. The different design and construction also determine which tools and resources they can utilize as well.\nFor example, fighter jets are designed to be fast, agile and strong in order to excel as effective military aircraft in battles. Passenger airplanes, on the other hand, are designed to ensure the comfort and safety of people carried on board.\nDifferent types of airplanes are also categorized based on shape and size. Larger airplanes have a larger size and shape than smaller airplanes. Bigger airplanes are capable of carrying more passengers, cargo and other important items and supplies. Smaller airplanes also have smaller carrying capacity.\nThe large and small size of different types of airplanes allow them to be utilized for different purposes. Large airplanes are generally more suitable for long-distance trips and long-haul travels due to their longer life cycles, high carrying capacity and energy efficiency.\nThe smaller size and shorter life cycle of small airplanes make them more suitable for short-distance and shorter trips. This is mainly due to their smaller size which makes them less energy efficient and less cost-efficient in the long run. However, small airplanes may excel as faster and easier-to-maneuver aircraft.\nToday, you can find airplanes in different types in service in various airports and flight terminals all over the world. The different categories of different types of airplanes used by the United States of America Air Force also define their useful purposes and the importance that they play in the performance of the Air Force.\nFighter jets, also known as military fighter planes, are military airplanes designed for long-distance travels and to be used for military purposes across the nation. Fighter jets are generally strong, agile and fast-moving aircraft that are equipped with modern weapons, defense systems and propellers.\nMilitary fighter jets in the US are generally classified using the F-number system. Aircraft classified using this system are generally categorized into four different ranges: F-1 to F-4 for smaller fighter jets, F-5 to F-15 for large and medium fighter jets and F-16 to F-22 Raptor for high performing fighter jets.\nFighter jets are generally the fastest and most agile types of aircrafts, and as such they can be used for long-distance travels as well as fast-motion and agile battle maneuvers. As such, fighter jets are an important part of the military in the United States, and they help ensure the country‚Äôs security and safety.\nTactical airplanes are military aircrafts that are designed to be used for shorter-distance and smaller-scale battle operations. Tactical airplanes often have smaller"

        "instruction": "Can you tell me a very easy to way clean a showerhead?",
        "output": "Can you tell me a very easy to way clean a showerhead?\nThe cleaners and sanitizers in your shampoo, especially those that contain ingredients like sodium chloride and ammonium chloride, can dry out the scalp. Avoid the use of shampoos that contain these ingredients. If your current shampoo contains sodium chloride or ammonium chloride, try applying shampoo to only half your scalp and conditioner to the other and rinsing well.\nQ: Can shampoo make hair more fragile and breakable?\nA: The pH and the condition and strength of your hair, as well as the specific ingredients in your shampoo, play key roles in determining if your hair will break. A high pH shampoo can increase the fragility of your hair. However, the specific ingredients in the shampoo determine if your hair's strength and condition will be compromised. If you have very dry or fragile hair, you may want to avoid using sodium lauryl sulfate. However, sulfate-free products often remove natural oils from your hair, which could leave your hair with problems like dryness and breakage. If this is the case, you may want to compromise and use an all-natural, sulfate-free shampoo if you find that your hair doesn't respond well to an all-natural shampoo.\nQ: Can your hair get frizzy if you do not use shampoo regularly?\nA: If you do not use shampoo regularly, you can experience increased breakage and hair loss due to the buildup of oil, dirt and dead hair cells in your hair. Shampoo can help remove these substances, preventing itching and irritation. However, using shampoo often can increase the amount and concentration of minerals and residue in your hair. Some people find that shampooing often makes it difficult to style their hair properly.\nQ: Are conditioners better for your hair than shampoos?\nA: Conditioners work by replenishing the natural oils and moisture that have been stripped by shampoo. However, most shampoos have conditioners, so that is the primary reason why you should shampoo. Regular shampooing helps prevent product buildup, which can leave your hair looking greasy, dull and difficult to style. In addition, some people find that their hair feels and looks healthier if they wash it every day.\nQ: Is shampoo important?\nA: Shampoo is not necessary. However, many people like the way their hair feels after washing with shampoo. In addition, most hair colors and treatments recommend that you wash your hair with shampoo to properly maintain your color. Shampoo gently removes buildup and residue.\nQ: How do you wash your hair?\nA: To wash your hair, start by squeezing about 2 tablespoons of conditioner into your palms. Apply the conditioner to your scalp. Once the scalp has been covered, you can begin to apply the conditioner to your hair from the root to the tip, combing gently from the bottom to the top. If your hair is very long, you can cut the combing time short by cutting off the dry ends and beginning to comb the conditioner onto your hair from the ends of mid-neck area.\nAfter your hair is saturated with conditioner, rinse the conditioner out with lukewarm water. After you have rinsed the conditioner from your hair, you can repeat the conditioner application process using a lighter hand when combing the conditioner through your hair."

        "output": "I need to get my nephew a birthday gift. I'm thinking of giving him a game for his Nintendo Switch. Can you give me a few options that came out recently? One that comes to mind is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It's coming out this December, and it offers different iterations of the characters, like in the Splatoon and Pokemon games. It's expected that the Wii U version will be compatible with the new console, but I'm not yet sure if there will be a version without the need for a \"GameCube Controller Adapter.\" I also don't know if it's going to be a paid DLC title that gets released over the coming months. Which games should I get for my nephew's birthday? Which versions do you think he should get?\nIs Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash an awesome game?\nI tried this game out, and it has Mario and other popular Nintendo characters like Yoshi, Luigi, Peach, and Bowser. It has both single player and multiplayer capabilities, allowing you to play with your Nintendo Switch controller or Wii U Pro Controller. The gameplay is a bit fast as you slide and jump around the courts to make a point. It's a little too fast for me but otherwise the game looks fun. So, what's your opinion on it? Is it an awesome game, or something you would skip?\nWhat are some good games to get for my Wii U?\nI've had a Wii U for a while now, and I've been wondering if there are some games that are decent that people play? I'm currently waiting for Smash Bros to come out on the Wii U, and I need some decent games to tide me over until then. One game off the top of my head is Super Mario 3D World. It's like the Super Mario 64 remake with a 2D Super Mario Bros game style that's like SMB 3 on the NES. I'm not sure if the game has a lot of replay value, but you get different styles to play, like being a princess and a cat and having four different characters to use at a time. I love it when the princess uses a hammer-like weapon to beat enemies like in the opening video. It's just so cool and powerful, but I wish the game had more side stories or at least co-op modes. It would still be cool if Nintendo made a sequel for all their Mario games at one time, just like the Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine re-releases for the Nintendo Wii. The other game is Super Mario 3D Land. It's actually a remake of a game on the 3DS, but it has a lot of the same levels and style of Super Mario Bros 3. I was surprised at the extra levels in the game, with the addition of some Luigi's Mansion levels in some of them, as in the final level of the game. This game was a great mix of 3D Mario Bros games and the side scrolling style of SMB 3. You can actually get a lot of extra levels for this game if you download it from the Nintendo eShop. So, what are some good games for the Wii U? What are some that you would recommend people to buy for this system?\nWhat do you think of Yoshi's Woolly World?\nHey, it's me again. If you remember, I'm the person with the \"Why Yoshi's Woolly World is good\" blog entry, and I think I did a good job of explaining the good points of the game. What I thought was interesting was the way it used wool and yarn in the game. The game also reminded me of a colorful version of the old Legend of Zelda game called Link's Awakening, which used a different type of yarn in the game to make the world feel different. The game also introduced some of the characters that appeared in Woolly World 2, as seen in the video below. Did you watch it? Is it something you would get as a Nintendo 3DS title? What games do you remember having some of the yarn ideas that they did?\nWhat games do you recommend for my Wii U?\nWhen I talk about \"recommend,\" I mean games that people like or would play a lot. I still would suggest playing Woolly World, because it's a good game and it's cute, plus it's one of the games that comes with the system if you buy a Wii U bundle. But yeah, like I said, I like adventure and platformers, so the"

I would love to eventually be able to come up with my own \"creative expressions\" of some of my favorite foods. I'm also interested in different cuisines, and love discovering exotic spices and \"foreign\" foods. I would love to learn more about how to cook foods from different parts of the world. I would like to begin cooking more of our own foods at home. It's a bit of a challenge for me to eat healthy, so I would love to come up with some good, tasty alternatives. I'm looking forward to digging in and getting started!\nAnswer: Great to have you on our program and welcome to our Dining Expert community. It is wonderful that you are both into culinary learning.

        "instruction": "What do the different octane values of gasoline mean?",
        "output": "What do the different octane values of gasoline mean? How can I obtain higher-octane fuel? What is the difference between gasoline and diesel fuel? Where do gasoline and diesel fuel come from? What are the different types of octane rating scales? Where in the process of producing gasoline and diesel fuel is the octane rating measured? Octane rating is used to make fuel for different types of engines in different applications. It is measured at different conditions and different standards so that we can compare the performance of various fuels in different engines. What Are Octane Rating Standards? The standards to measure the octane rating of pure gasoline vary by location and over time. The United States introduced a standard way of measuring octane ratings in the early 1970s. The standard required measuring fuels using a research carburetor to ensure that all fuels were tested under the same conditions. Although the research carburetor was introduced in the mid-1970s, the current test method using the research carburetor remains the standard in the United States. What Is the Research Carburetor? The research carburetor, also called the 1 bar carburetor, is an instrument developed by the Federal Motor Safety Administration and the American Society for Testing and Materials to measure octane ratings. The research carburetor was developed to ensure that all octane ratings measured using the new standard research carburetor were accurate. A research carburetor consists of a carburetor flame, thermocouple, water-cooling system, and pressure gauges. The carburetor mixes gasoline and air at the correct temperature so that the air-gasoline mixture can be measured in an accurate and repeatable way. The thermocouple measures the flame temperature of the carburetor flame. If the research carburetor measures a gasoline fuel with a high octane rating, the flame temperature increases beyond the expected range. The water-cooling system protects the thermocouple from damage resulting from extreme flame temperatures. The engine control computer can adjust the fuel setting and air-fuel mixture while the research carburetor is being used. The pressure gauges monitor and balance the air in the research carburetor so that it remains at constant pressure and temperature while being tested. How Are Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Stored Before Use? Fuel production facilities produce both commercial and premium fuels. Premium fuels are typically stored in large, aboveground fuel tanks. Commercial and premium fuels may be dispensed out of bulk fuel terminals where the fuels are transported by tanker trucks and other vehicles. Diesel fuel is typically kept in aboveground tanks in terminals or in underground tanks on diesel fuel dispensers. Diesel fuel can also be stored in a fuel depot with a large underground fuel tank. Premium fuels and diesel fuel can sometimes be stored in aboveground tanks along with commercial fuels such as gasoline and E15, a fuel blend of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline used in flex fuel vehicles. Who Controls How Fuels Are Stored? Most fuel production facilities are regulated by government agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Department of Transportation (DOT). They require that the facility meet specified storage standards or be classified as a hazardous area. The local community government may also play a role in regulating how fuel storage units are constructed and operated by requiring construction permits and inspections. Some communities may require fuel to be stored in aboveground tanks, while others may allow the tank to be stored underground. Some government agencies may regulate or require inspections of any fuel produced in commercial quantities, where the EPA and DOT apply these regulatory requirements to the first 10 million gallons of fuel produced during a calendar year. What are the Different Types of Octane Ratings? The octane rating of gasoline and diesel fuel is determined using different standards and scales. The standard research carburetor, which was introduced in the 1970s, is the current standard in the United States for measuring the octane rating of pure gasoline. This research carburetor measures the octane rating of gasoline by measuring the peak flame temperature of the engine, which is typically between 600 and 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. When the fuel-air mixture of the engine reaches the octane rating of the fuel, the fuel mixture becomes turbulent, causing the flame temperature to increase. The temperature of the research carburetor has"

        "output": "How can I fix a leaking roof?\n3 ways to fix a leaky roof\n1. Patch the leak\nLeaks can originate from any location, so start by identifying the cause and repairing it first.\nThe most common source of leaks in a roof system is flashing or seals ‚Äì these are at the areas where any two sections of the system meet, such as where the roof meets the walls.\nOther leaky areas include cracks or holes in the roof membrane, as well as any connections to other roof sections.\nThe next step is to get the roof system repaired. Generally flashing or seals are simple to replace, however membrane and other parts are more difficult and often must be replaced. This includes roofing materials like the underlay, battens and trims.\nIn some instances, it makes more sense to fix the cause, rather than just replacing flashing and re-sealing the roof section.\nIf you‚Äôre considering replacing your old roof, read our story on how to choose a new roof.\n2. Repair any damage\nRepair and replace any other damaged components of your roof, such as gutters or fascias. You may want to upgrade your flashing ‚Äì or replace it altogether ‚Äì to avoid any future leaks.\nIt‚Äôs always a good idea to have your roof inspected by a licensed professionals to ensure it‚Äôs up to the current standards and is ready for the next extreme storm.\nThe last step in fixing the leak involves making sure the roof is watertight, allowing any accumulated moisture to drain efficiently.\n3. Repair/replace flashing and seals\nAs mentioned in the previous section, you‚Äôll want to start by inspecting your flashing and seals. If the flashing isn‚Äôt firmly adhered to the walls or other roof sections, or if there are gaps or tears, it‚Äôs easy for water to leak in.\nIt‚Äôs important to inspect your flashings and seals regularly.\nThe most common flashing problem in Australia is a lack of sufficient expansion joints (also known as weep holes). These are typically placed along the lower edges of roof seams, which is one of the most common places for leaks in roof systems.\nAnother common cause of leaks is gaps in the flashing.\nTo prevent gaps in flashing, you can either remove the flashing and reapply new sheeting, or add an additional layer of flashing between the two. For instance, a double layer of flashing can add a barrier against leaks (as would the extra flashing layer), however it won't provide a waterproof barrier.\nIf you have any cracks in the roof membrane ‚Äì typically the most common cause of leaks in Australian homes ‚Äì you'll need to replace these too. It's recommended to use liquid roofing membranes here, rather than the asphalt-based ones currently available.\nLastly, you should always ensure roof flashing is properly installed by a professional, as this is how most roof leaks begin.\nIn summary, make sure to:\nLocate and replace any damaged roof flashing or membrane\nRepair any roof penetration, trim or other features. This includes chimneys, downpipes and vents\nCheck for and repair or replace any expansion joints\nIdentify a leak and fix it to prevent water penetration. If your roof is leaking and your roof flashing or seals don't seem to be the cause then read our story on troubleshooting leaking tiles.\nThe roofing expert at your local hardware store also can likely help to pinpoint specific leaks on your roof system, as well as fix it with the right materials.\nIt's also a good idea to regularly inspect your roof for damage or leaks. Even a small amount of water in one spot can turn into large-scale damage over time.\nLeaking roof? How to fix a leaking roof\nLeaks in your roof can damage to the interior of your home and cause significant headaches when it comes to repairing them. When they do occur, however, they are often preventable with the proper steps and maintenance. While you don‚Äôt always have to do a complete roof replacement, there are several steps which you can take to address the issue if it recurs again.\nBefore addressing other more common reasons for leaks, it‚Äôs important to ensure that your roof is truly leaking. Depending on the material, it can be difficult to determine whether there‚Äôs actually water behind it. There are some signs, however, which are often indicative and should not be ignored. These include:\nPuddles of water on your roof or in your loft\nWet spots inside your"

But that‚Äôs how you get clean water.\nSome communities get their water from up above. It‚Äôs not under the ground, it comes from the sky! There are different names for this kind of water. It rains or snows and then water flows from mountains down to rivers, lakes, and seas.

        "output": "Hi, I'd like to learn how to play racquetball. Can you explain the game to me? I've never played before.\nCongratulations on being able to play your first game of racquetball. It will take some time to learn how to play but in the end I am certain you will enjoy it.\nRacquetball is a game of speed and skill and has two players on either side of the court. The court is marked with numbered lines from 1 to 15, and each line consists of two colored stripes. There are two goal-posts marked with colored strings at the front of the court. The goal-posts are not in play, but they are used in scorekeeping after a point, or game, is finished. There is also a line near the front line or service line that is not marked by a colored line but is still used in scoring (called a \"warm-up line\"). There is a small wall on each side of the goal-post that is the back boundary to each side of the court but is not considered a part of the court itself (the area beyond is considered \"out of bounds\"). There is one side of the court that is considered to be the front side and the other wall is considered to be the backside. It is possible to play racquetball in many other ways (by two players facing each other, or by two players facing the rear wall, or two players facing the side walls, or three players, or four players, etc.) but the game described here will be played with two players on either side of the court.\nPlayers are allowed one bounce on the ball. If an opponents hits the ball back over the net, it is then considered a rally. If the opposing player hits the ball and it crosses the net but goes directly back over the net, the player must let the other player serve again. The next ball is not considered a \"hit\", but rather a \"rally\" that stops the count (called \"rally points\") at the time it is hit over the net by the opponent. If the rally ball crosses the net with the racquet and hits the front wall (called a \"kick serve\"), then the point begins and the player is considered the server. As long as the returning player stays \"in bounds\", and does not hit the ball to the rear wall, this continues for one bounce (called a rally point) or until the ball crosses the net between the opponent and the front wall (an \"out of bounds\" point) and the server continues to serve until he loses the rally points or until he hits the ball to the opposing player's rear side (a \"let serve\"). The winner is determined by whoever wins the majority of rally points in one game, or until a player reaches 15 points, and wins by two points.\nThere are several different serving positions which involve hitting the ball from different angles of the court. The most common is hitting the ball while standing right on the baseline (the area closest to your side walls). This position involves hitting the ball with a \"short\" swing (when the racquet makes contact with the ball, it is closer to the ground but still above your head). Many players tend to use what is called a \"long\" swing when they stand much further back from the front baseline (nearer to the opposite player on the other side of the court). The long swing is when the racquet is used to hit the ball in one solid motion all the way to the back wall. A longer swing allows players to make the ball move faster and in a different direction than a short swing. It also gives a better view of the ball when a player is farther back on the court. It is also important for players to learn both serving positions just in case they encounter an opponent that does not serve the same way they do. Players can also serve from the side baselines (on the front side of the court, or the back side of the court, depending on how you look at it), or even stand right behind the opponent and hit the ball from behind the opponent's shoulder, but a long serving position tends to give the server a better view of their return and therefore should be preferred."

If I am correct, the number of rows in an output can be changed. However, each row should still keep its original category.

Sometimes, all a person wants is to feel heard and understood if this is how things work for you, or if your needs are not being met, remember to ask for what you need. For example, ask your partner to help out with the daycare or get a babysitter in for a date night.\nAs a parent, you need to ask yourself if you have the emotional and physical resources available to you to make good parenting decisions. If you know you need help, take concrete steps to find it. Ask your partner for support. Ask friends for help, or reach out to a parenting hotline. If your family or friends are not supportive, you should consider joining parenting groups to meet others who are in a similar situation, or try parenting support groups for help with the emotional aspects of motherhood. The decision to breastfeed or use formula milk is often a difficult one, filled with personal choice and the knowledge that it will have a long-term impact on baby's health.\nYou may have heard many different opinions from friends, family, and the internet, which can make it difficult to decide what is best for your baby.\nSometimes there is no easy answer, and you may change your mind during your pregnancy or after your baby is born. Make sure you have plenty of time to discuss your decisions with your partner, your midwife or doctor, and your family members. If deciding on the best breastfeeding method for your baby and you is a long-term decision, such as exclusive breastfeeding, or deciding on formula, then seek professional help from your healthcare provider and other trusted sources, as well as finding support from parenting groups and online forums.\nThe decision to formula-feed or exclusively breastfeed is one that often causes a lot of questions. The right approach for you and your baby will depend on a number of factors, including:.\nYour decision will impact your baby's future health and nutrition as well as their emotional, cognitive and social development. If you decide to formula-feed, it can feel overwhelming to remember to manage different types of formula and make sure the right baby-focused foods are in your home. This can affect your budget, as well as your day-to-day stress levels. If you decide to exclusively breastfeed, it's not always possible to breastfeed at every feed or even every day.\nYou'll need to find ways to stay healthy, deal with low milk supply and find support in your local community. Your options for breastfeeding could include:. If you do decide to exclusively formula-feed or to breastfeed, it's very important to seek out support from other parents, friends, and a healthcare team. In the long term, your child will benefit from the social and educational networks that you'll build around them in later years.\nThe first few days and weeks as a mother from the first smile and frown to early development.\nA lot of people say that your first year as a mother goes by much faster than you imagine, and that it feels like a fog of sleepless nights and baby feeding.

What color(s) would you prefer?  What will you use them for?  What other jewelry would you wear with a pearl necklace?  Why would you rather buy one than a diamond?  Why do most people prefer diamonds to pearls?  Pearls are usually thought of as the more traditional gem, because the shape is so organic.  But pearls do command price points that are more reflective of the price and rarity of rare natural gems.  To purchase pearls, you are generally taking the risk that what you purchase can be worn, or sold or traded, in the future.  It's really about you and your taste.  And whether or not pearls are \"in\" at the moment.  Pearls are timeless, but the fashion and jewelry trends will determine whether or not they are in.  There are also now many fashionable faux pearls - including the Kara Tiara Pearl Charm, by Kateri, which sells on http://www.soscrappy.net (SosCrappy is the ecommerce arm of the Crochet Crowd, which is a large, world-wide free group on Yahoo). All these sites have a wide range of pearls, and faux pearls, which are often made with resin.  All of the above pearl vendors have a wide variety of styles and colors.  Most pearls will be at retail price points of $4 - $20 + per piece.  There are some very inexpensive imitation pearls, but they are made from plastic, not natural or cultured pearls.  That's very important, to know that they are imitation pearls, usually plastic.  There are also many artificial cultured pearls, made from glass, which should be sold as faux pearls - but not often are.  There have also been plastic beads sold as pearls.  The most expensive authentic pearls can be $1,000 and up per piece, but they are very expensive.  The more traditional jewelry that is sold with pearls tends to be more expensive.  You can buy very inexpensive pearl strands, and you can find good deals on bead stores, and eBay, on vintage and antique pearls.  Pearls are a very traditional and elegant gem.  They symbolize purity and chastity.  Most pearls are worn in strands, and the quality and value of the pearls will determine the price of the entire strand.  It's important to know and understand the quality of the pearls that you are purchasing.  You don't have to purchase them from a store.  But it's important to be educated about the grading of pearls, which will also affect the price.  I prefer pearls that I can wear, or sell or trade in the future, if the price of pearls increases, for example, (which they often do).  I look for good quality pearls, I like the classic shapes, because they can be more traditional, but they are also very versatile.  Some pearls will have iridescent colors, metallic blues and silvers, some will be white, some will be bi color, and some will be multi colored, like a rainbow inside the pearl, which is very stunning.  I can wear pearls anytime, with any outfit, for day or night, and I can always use or sell or trade the pearls later.  To buy or not to buy?  To me, when I purchase a pearl, it's not something to be worn right away.  It's something to enjoy, wear, cherish, and know that it will be there for me in the future.  It's something that my grandchildren will enjoy, too.  Someone else will enjoy it, or treasure it now.  And in the future, there will always be new trends and styles.  So I will never be out of style!  Why do you like pearls?  I love pearls!  They are classic, timeless and elegant.  Some pearls will have a metallic luster on the inside, when they are viewed up close, which is very pretty, and adds to the natural beauty of a pearl.  Some p"

This technique will also extend the life of herbs that have already started to wilt. But, before you can begin the drying process, it‚Äôs important to ensure that the herbs are as fresh as possible. Harvest herbs in the morning before any leaves may begin to wilt. This will allow you to select full, bright leaves for drying rather than herbs that may appear brown and dried out.\nHerbs should be cut close to the ground; if possible try to clip herbs in the morning rather than the evening to reduce the risk of leaves becoming limp or wilted due to moisture loss.\nLeaves should be removed from any flower stems, and the tips of each leaf should be pinched off, leaving the stalks as upright as possible. (Dried flowers or other parts of the plant can be left intact as well).\nHerbs that are being dried whole should be laid in a single layer on a flat surface and left to dry fully in a cool, dry location. Remember that drying times will vary depending on the type of herb being dried. Drying times for various herbs can be found in the table below.\nOnce fully dry, leaves can be placed in airtight containers or freezer bags. Freeze these dried herbs at low temperatures in bags or air-tight containers to preserve their integrity when they are removed from the freezer.\nBefore you dry your herbs, make sure to check out these tips.\nDo not dry herbs that have started to wilt or show signs of fungal damage.\nIf possible, try to harvest herbs in the morning to avoid leaves becoming limp and wilted throughout the day.\nAvoid handling and transporting herbs as much as possible during the drying process to prevent leaves from becoming limp and unappealing.\nDry herbs in a location with cool, dry airflow to help prevent the occurrence of mold and mildew. If drying herbs in a location with low humidity, it may be necessary to cover the area with a fabric shield such as cheesecloth to prevent mold spores from being released into the air that may cause allergies or other health problems. If the cheesecloth becomes covered with moisture, remove it from the location and allow it to dry out completely prior to placing it back on your herbs.\nHerbs should be cut close to the ground to avoid the loss of moisture and increase the chance of success when drying.\nLeaves should be removed from any stems if possible. Additionally, the tough stems of various herbs can sometimes make handling or cutting them while dried difficult. Try to cut along the stems near the base to leave the stems as upright as possible.\nAir circulation can cause dry herbs to become brittle and prone to breakage. Try to spread herbs out across a relatively flat surface to minimize the amount of airflow directed towards your dried herbs.\nAvoid contact with herbs once they have been dried completely. As a general rule, these processes are best avoided in order to preserve the overall appearance and quality of the herbs.\nIf possible, try to cut your herbs shortly after sunrise and place them on a flat, dry, dark-colored surface to avoid any contact with moisture or any other foreign items (such as dust or dirt) that may cause your herbs to brown.\nLeaves should be thoroughly patted or rinsed thoroughly (depending on the type of herbs being dried) with warm water after cutting in order to remove any tiny pieces of soil or other debris that may have become trapped within the leaf.\nTry to avoid harvesting and handling herbs during times of day when moisture is high, such as the early morning, just prior to sunset, or in"

How to make them at home. I was touched. Thank you for loving a recipe. And for all your kind words. Chocolate Chip Cookies (my most searched-for recipe) 4 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 2 eggs 1/2 cup vegetable oil 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 cup chocolate chips 1 cup milk chocolate chips 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (or pecans or peanuts) Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, cream together butter with brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy. Add eggs and mix until incorporated, scraping down the sides as needed. Add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the heavy cream. Stir in chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. Form dough into a disc. Pat dough with hands to help absorb any excess flour. Roll out the dough onto a baking mat to about 1/4 inch thick. Use a round 3-inch cookie cutter to stamp out dough, or flatten dough with a fork to make a crisscross design. Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until lightly browned (and still slightly underbaked on the inside). Fear not, it will continue to cook as it cools. Drizzle with a bit of milk chocolate or walnut chocolate, if desired. Cool completely on a cooling rack (overnight is best).

        "output": "What color is the sky to you? How many different shades do you actually see? How far can you distinguish the blue of an early morning sky and the blue of a late afternoon or early evening sky?\nFor the purpose of this study, we have chosen to use the following scale of color distinction by shade:\n0: Black.\n1: Violet.\n2: Deep Blue.\n3: Light Blue.\n4: Light Aqua.\n5: Light Green.\n6: Green.\n7: Yellow.\n8: Orange.\n9: Red.\n10: Brown.\nIt is important to distinguish the subtle differences between shades of color, in order to correctly diagnose some form of vision loss. Sometimes it is more than possible to discern the shades of the same color in different hues, as with the violet shade, or they may be unable to discern at all, as with the reds. In the cases of the patients with the more severe color loss, even those shades they can seem to distinguish, have a tendency to blend into each other, or even be confused, with one another. These shades of color are referred to in this study as, ‚Äúblended colors‚Äù or ‚Äúconfused colors.‚Äù\nToning and contrast sensitivity have the ability to help diagnose these different types of color vision loss. When patients can still discern the shades of contrasting colors, they are said to have, ‚Äútoning‚Äù or ‚Äútone,‚Äù sensitivity; when they can identify only the lighter, or the darker shade of a contrasting color, they have, ‚Äúlow toning,‚Äù or a ‚Äúlow tone,‚Äù sensitivity. On the other hand patients, with, ‚Äúlow tone,‚Äù sensitivity seem to generally have difficulty distinguishing between the shades of blended colors, and low tone sensitivity is thought to be a result of color vision deficiency, or defective chromosomes.\nIt is important to be able to distinguish between these two types of color loss, as they are usually treated in very different ways. Low toning sensitivity can usually be improved dramatically in most cases by the use of special glasses and low vision devices or lenses that correct for specific color deficiencies in the eyes. This is especially true for those with very early stages of color vision loss, where there may not yet be any noticeable difference in the shades of a particular color. Treating this, ‚Äúearly,‚Äù stage is the best, although not always possible, way to preserve or even improve the overall vision in the eyes of the patient.\nUnlike patients with low toning, or low tone, sensitivity, there may still be hope for many patients with a complete ‚Äúcolor deficiency‚Äù or ‚Äúcolor blindness,‚Äù where they can no longer identify the shades of colors in the least, even between the lightest and darkest shades. In most cases there is very little, if anything, that can be done to improve these kinds of color vision problems. However, with the proper use of low vision equipment or devices, many patients with color deficiency can still greatly improve their vision and their ability to complete various tasks at home, work or school.\nAs with most vision loss, however, there are certain cases where certain shades of color, whether it is the lighter or darker ones, or even the confused ones, may become easier or harder to distinguish among at various times. Some patients report being able to see certain shades of light or dark colors in some conditions, and having a very difficult time seeing even the same shade in other situations. In some cases there seemed to be a strong connection between the amount of light present in the room or around the patient, and their ability to see or distinguish color shades more or less clearly.\nIt has been our intention here at VisionAware to present some of this valuable information to the blind or visually impaired community in a clear and understandable manner. We hope that the resources we have included here will be able to help them make better choices when it comes to color vision loss.\n1. National Eye Institute.

If you want to give something special to your guests you might try this traditional Latvian vegetable soup ‚Äì Frikadeƒºu zupa. I have to admit it is one of my favorite Latvian dishes, and when I lived in Latvia my mom used to cook it very often. One thing that makes this soup really different it that you use meat. This particular soup is perfect for vegetarians or for people who love spicy food and want something a little different than a traditional vegetable soup.\nFirst preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Clean the squash and cut it in half by cutting through the squash lengthwise. Place cut squash half on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and ground black pepper. Put the squash in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. When squash is cool enough to handle, scoop out the seeds and discard them.\nPeel the squash, then dice into small cubes. Set aside.\nSaut√© carrots, cabbage and onion in the butter for 10 minutes. Add the chopped herbs and diced cooked squash.\nBoil water in a large pot and blanch the potatoes.

        "output": "Hi, I'd like to make my own peanut brittle. Can you give me a recipe and cooking instructions for that? Thanks for your help!\nA. I don't really make it. I just follow the recipe that is on the Nestle's Crunch box. However, I have printed the recipe out from the Fannie Farmer cookbook so I have it here at home. I will check with the cookbook author to see if there is any difference in her recipe and the box recipe, but that will mean I have to make the recipe and then taste it to see if it really is any different. Hopefully that will not be too difficult...\nHere again is the Nestle's box recipe. I will do the comparo and update this blog this weekend.\nNote: If you are using the old style 480 Cal box with the Nestle's Crunch chunks, the recipe does not include the salt. (The chunks contain enough salt) If you need to include a pinch of salt, it is a pinch of salt. If the recipe calls for a cup of sugar to be sprinkled over the mix, it is a cup of sugar. This recipe does say \"1 cup of sugar\" but that means a large pinch to a tablespoon of sugar.\nUpdate: Cookbook Author Joanne Chang has a different recipe from Nestle's but the basic process is the same\nNestle's, Nestle's Crunch Peanut Brittle\nJoanne's (baked)\n1 pk. peanuts, roasted and roughly ground\n1/3 cup sugar, plus more for coating kernels, plus some for sprinkling\nIn a medium skillet, 2 quart or larger or just larger than a 1 gallon stock pot, add the sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Bring to a low simmer and stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves and turns a very light amber color. (3-5 minutes)\nPlace the peanut brittle in a heavy (13x9) pan. Work quickly to coat the peanut brittle with the butter. Sprinkle with the nuts and coconut. Working quickly, pour the syrup over the top of the peanut brittle and sprinkle with the remaining sugar. DO NOT STIR! Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes, allowing the sugar and syrup to be absorbed by the peanut brittle. Then cover the pan with foil and place it in the fridge until the granulated sugar hardens, about an hour.\nServe cold. The granulated sugar will melt and then harden to create a perfect brittle crunch.\nThe next time I make this, I am going to take a picture because the syrup is a little hard to describe in words. It's a very light amber color, not dark but not a light yellow either.\nI liked it! but I found it a little on the sweet side. I made it again with 1 cup sugar and 1 cup of butter. I like it, but my family liked the softer version better. I hope there is a way to find a good balance for me! This version is a keeper and I will make it again, but not every time\nLabels: brittle, chocolate, cookbooks, creme, dessert, nut, peanut, Valentine's Day\nI just made these - they are AMAZING!! I followed your recipe but didn't use the vanilla - just sprinkled the salt over - and WHOA! Great taste, and fun to make as part of a class. Thanks so much - will be doing it again soon :-)\nKaitlyn October 26, 2011 at 8:17 PM\nI have followed this exact recipe from the nestles box for years but I was wondering if you had any suggestions for a better flavour? Other then adding different chocolate flavouring or salted butter, any tips or secrets? Thanks!\nKaitlyn, I really haven't found a way to improve the flavor. It's good as-is with the vanilla and salt. If you find something, then let me know what you use and how you use it so I can try it!\nMy kids love the Nestle Chunk Peanut brittle boxes, but I've never made it.

        "output": "I'm trying to stop my neighbour's cat from coming in to my garden and fighting with my cat. Any suggestions on how to do that? Thanks.\nPost by: Cathy on March 01, 2010, 12:10:40 pm\nQuote from: Piglet on February 27, 2010, 05:16:22 pm\nIf you do try this you will need to put the chicken wire outside the fence at the base, so that you have two fences - one inside and one outside. This is because chicken wire has the tendency to buckle, leaving gaping holes if it is wrapped around the inside of a fence, so you need to run the wire in the ground along the base (ie outside the fence) to keep it secure. This will also ensure that your fence does not slip by allowing you to put the chicken wire inside the foot as well as on top.\nIf you try to do it the other way (inside the fence and then extending it over the top) you will have problems and there's a good possibility that when you come to take the fence off you will get it stuck around the fence posts and you will have to cut it off which will ruin the finish of your fence.\nYou will have to keep the cat outside or use electric fencing - these are your only options now until you repair your cat fence. You would be well advised to re-fence the whole length so that the cat can only enter your garden or any area that you want to keep safe through the gate - you can then put the electric fence around the outside. I don't think that you would be able to use it successfully to stop the cat entering your garden from the gate as if the fence is not high enough to prevent this then it would probably be too easy to jump or push through it, and if the height is ok then the cat wouldn't be deterred by the electricity because we use it here and cats still manage to get through it.\nTo be honest I don't think that electric fencing and/or chicken wire is going to solve your problem as I think that your neighbours cat will find a way in. It might make you feel a bit safer though. :roll:\nYou can also try to trap the cats - perhaps you have one trapped already. Trap the cats for a couple of days to give you time to re-fence the gate and then release them back to their own territory.\nYou will find that some cat owners have a really territorial attitude to their own cat and feel that their cat has a right to visit the garden of the house next door because the cat lives with them, has a right to go where it likes, etc., etc - these people are usually quite surprised if anyone wants to stop their cat from visiting because of the noise it makes, defecating on the neighbour's garden, etc., etc.\nI know this doesn't sound very helpful but unless you are prepared to use electric fencing or trap the cats none of the other suggestions are going to work.\nPost by: RB on March 01, 2010, 12:24:32 pm\nWe used to have similar problems and in the end we took the only sensible option in not having our garden trashed by visitors. We now have a high metal fence with only a window (about 4' x 4') to the front so it's unlikely we can be jumped by our neighbours' cats. Any larger animals come through that window or are turned back.\nOf course there are downsides to this as now we can't let the dogs or cats out into our garden.\nPost by: Piglet on March 15, 2010, 03:26:14 pm\nThanks for your help Cathy. I've now built a small, temporary fence, made of chicken wire and wood, which I'm hoping to keep the cat from jumping over. I'm keeping our cat locked in the inside of the gate (and putting her back in occasionally as she gets used to it) and the cat next door is not even getting near the small fence so it is proving successful so far.\nI don't mind the cat visiting but the fact is that it makes a horrible old din at night and its droppings are all over the garden, which we're not allowed to pick up or leave by the cat waste bins as its next door owner thinks we should put up with it! I also don't like the idea that she is letting the cat in. I've now"

        "instruction": "does the dinosaurs really exist?",
        "output": "does the dinosaurs really exist?\nIt is the most sought after evidence for the existence of dinosaurs. However, the discovery of the ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù fossil has been a huge blow to people who believe in ‚ÄúDinosaurs‚Äù. Because as we shall find out, it turns out that the dinosaurs as they appeared to us just recently are an illusion. Furthermore it turns out that the age of the dinosaurs is also an illusion ‚Ä¶\nBefore we start to look at the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù fossil, let me give you some background. About 20 years ago I went to a lecture at Imperial College (it is the one I mentioned in my article ‚ÄúThe Truth About Radiation‚Äù). There they had put up a slide claiming that the age of the dinosaurs were 110 million years old whereas they date back thousands of years and the lecture was claiming that the difference was due to ‚Äúradiation‚Äù.\nThousands of people saw the slide and thousands of people came away with an idea that dinosaurs had only lived about 110 million years ago. Then, when I went to the Natural History Museum and looked at some skeletons of dinosaurs, it was not hard to find some dinosaur skeletons dating back thousands of years.\nI always thought this was a bad idea on the part of the people promoting the theory of radiation dating because people would never do that for their own skeletons. But apparently they did do that with the dinosaurs and in 1981 it was discovered that there were dinosaur fossils dated between fifty and a hundred thousand years old (you will find most of the details of the discovery of the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù fossils in my article ‚ÄúThe Truth About Radiation‚Äù).\nNow when the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù fossil was discovered in 1993 there was a lot of excitement. There were hundreds of newspaper articles and many TV programmes on the discovery, because people knew that this was really going to shake the foundations of the theory of evolution. Because it has been accepted from the start that the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago.\nI have to say that the fossil was found by a group of American and Chinese geologists. There was a lot of bad publicity about this at the time because apparently the Chinese Geologists were selling the fossils to collectors when they should have handed them in to museums. It was only when the Americans found out that they demanded the fossils back and then discovered that they were valuable because it was so difficult to find fossils this size from this age. But by this time the publicity that was needed to raise the money for the purchase had been done. The National Geographic did a programme on the story and a lot of money was raised to ensure the fossils stayed together and were not sold to private collectors. Some money was also raised to enable the fossils to be taken to America and placed in a Museum.\nBefore we look at what is in the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù fossil, I want to make it clear that if you believe in evolution, then this fossil simply does not exist because they only believe that dinosaurs have been around for about fifty million years. So the fact that you are reading this article proves that you have stumbled across the truth.\nBefore I do let me remind you that there is nothing that you do that will change the minds of supporters of the theory of evolution. When I say there is nothing that you do that will change the minds of supporters of the theory of evolution, what I mean is that there is nothing that you do that they are not perfectly happy with.\nEven now I have people writing to me to correct me, for example one woman has written to say that ‚Äúdinosaurs did live 65 million years ago‚Äù, but of course if this was correct it would undermine the theory of evolution and therefore the scientists would not be in any way happy. In fact the person who corrected me is a Scientific Adviser to the National Trust and I think that one of the reasons she wrote to me is because she thought I did not mean all the people who write to me, she just thought I was being a bit rude about the scientists.\nSo what evidence will we find in the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù fossil that contradicts evolution and proves that the dinosaurs lived alongside people thousands of years ago. There are two pieces of evidence to look at ‚Ä¶\n1. Is the fossil a mix of reptiles and birds and was it originally the same animal that later developed anatomically to be a separate species of a bird\nThis is very easy to test, and of course I have all of the information that I need so that I can prove my case absolutely. I have made a list"

        "output": "Can you give any tips on how to cook a juicy, medium-rare steak? D Can we use a cooking thermometer and still get a juicy steak? D Easy‚Ä¶if you cook a steak over very hot coals, and the heat is applied evenly over time, you won‚Äôt have a problem. Cooking directly over hot coals doesn‚Äôt always work, so the trick is to keep the temp as even as possible and try to give the steak as little opportunity as possible to ‚Äúrun off‚Äù from the heat. Here are steps you can take to help achieve this: Avoid fluctuations in heat‚Äîmake sure the heat source is as consistent as possible from start to finish. Start with the heat at the highest level you can and then ramp it down during the cook. For example, I would start with the flame setting about 10, (or a gas grill at very high), and I would let that set for 3-4 minutes and then reduce it to about 4-5 and keep it there for the rest of the time. This keeps the flame moving slowly and evenly from the start to finish, resulting in a gentler heating process and better caramelization on the grill marks. Avoid opening the cover too often‚Äîkeep the lid closed, as this can result in sudden and dramatic fluctuations in heat and the temperature of the steak. Steaks cook quickly due to the very high heat, and it is very easy for the heat source to shift, resulting in a cold spot that can throw the temperature off. A steak that is cooked correctly can be left uncovered for the final 10 minutes of the cook, but otherwise, I recommend keeping the lid closed. Avoid overcooking‚Äîthe most common cause of a steak that is cooked to one temperature in the middle but another temperature on the edges. This is usually caused by: a) cooking the outside first, which can result in a much higher temp. outside than inside; b) putting too much heat in (see above‚Äîa sudden increase in heat can throw off the final temperatures); and c) cooking the steaks too close together. By keeping the steaks apart, less heat is transferred across the cook surface and the temp.s should be more even. In addition, the steaks will cook more quickly and the interior temp. will be higher, so they can be seared on each side without overcooking. Finally, it is important to know your steak‚Äîselecting a good cut and cooking method will go a long way toward achieving your goals. To select a good cut, find a trusted butcher and ask for advice. Be sure to look for a cut with nice marbling (or ‚Äúfat‚Äù), which can result in a moister interior that is also easier to caramelize. I recommend choosing a cut with more than 10 grams per 4 ounces. If you can, cut your steaks on a bias‚Äîtry to find a cut with a bit more fat in one direction than the other. Once you have your steaks, it is time to think about your method of cooking. If you are cooking over live coals, (as in the photo below), then a method that works for me is to start with a high flame and put the steaks in. Let them sit quietly on the grill (or in the fireplace), soaking up the heat without too much attention. After about 2 minutes, I start to rotate the steaks and then reopen the grill for about 30 seconds to get a nice crisp sear on each side. I then put the steaks back in the grill to finish cooking and remove them when they are the right temp.s. This method works well with a steak that is about 1‚Ä≥ thick. If your grill is gas-fired, then the method is a little different. Start with the heat on ‚Äúhigh‚Äù (or as high as your grill‚Äôs temperature control will go), and allow the grill to preheat for about 15 minutes. After that time, remove the grill for a few minutes to let the coals re-ignite and then place the steaks on to heat, trying to rotate as little as possible. Keep the heat about 4-5 for 2 minutes and then reduce to 3-4. Let the steaks rest for a few minutes and then return them to the grill. Turn the steaks over after 1 minute or, in my case, when you can hear the ‚Äúsizzle.‚Äù This method works for thinner steaks and results in a nice caramelized crust and a delicious, juicy interior. As always, enjoy! TOMKATKAY."

        "output": "When was hip hop invented?\nThe 1970s: Hip-Hop Begins with Disco\nHip-hop was not invented in 1973, but its roots are still in disco.\nIn 1973, a DJ in New York named Kool Herc hosted parties in West Bronx housing projects, where black and Latino teens gathered to dance. Herc would play two copies of the same record, beat-matching them to create long, synchronized mixes for the crowd. He had first learned to do this technique in Cincinnati, and he brought it back to New York City. Soon people in the Bronx began referring to the DJ as ‚ÄúKool Herc.‚Äù\nThe DJs of the 1970s played music that was very different from disco. The early hip-hop songs were generally based on funk and R&B, and they emphasized dance moves. Rappers would come on between songs and talk to the crowd, but most of the lyrics were just chants and screaming.\nA few DJs, though, were trying to do something new and different. In the early 1970s, one of them was Kool Herc in New York City, and in 1973 he began experimenting with beat-mixing. Another early DJ was Afrika Bambaataa, a Bronx club DJ. One day Bambaataa heard a new music craze called hip-hop, which was also inspired by disco, and he began to incorporate it into his mixes. Hip-hop became a big part of his mixes, and that helped make it an important part of the overall hip-hop movement. Bambaataa also invented the idea of a hip-hop dance crew. He called his crew the Rock Steady Crew, and he encouraged other crews to form. Today, there are more than 40 different hip-hop dance crews around the world!\nAt the same time that hip-hop dance crews were becoming popular in New York City, another important development was taking place in Los Angeles. In 1971 a DJ named Theodore began playing music at a block party. He made up the rhymes to his songs as he went along, and people loved it! He soon gained a following at clubs and parties around Los Angeles. He called his street party-style of rap ‚Äúhip-hop‚Äù and was one of the first DJs to use turntables to mix songs at a party. He recorded songs and gave them away for free to spread his music.\nBefore long, a group of rappers formed around Theodore, and they called themselves the Original Rock Steady Crew. When they performed, they did so with an electric beat box and a sound system known as party mixers, which you can see in the next section. The group produced a record called ‚ÄúKing Tim III‚Äù in 1979. It featured a brand-new rapping style known as ‚Äúold school.‚Äù These artists used a lot of the same chants, screams, and rhymes as the early hip-hop crews in New York. Today the old school style of hip-hop dance and music is more popular than ever!\nIn 1978, hip-hop crews began to form around the country and around the world. Hip-hop crews usually formed in a neighborhood or a town, where there were a lot of artists mixing music together. The Rock Steady Crew and the Original Rock Steady Crew are still going strong today‚Äîand they‚Äôre not the only crews to survive all these years!\nOne of the most famous crews in history is the Freshest Kids, more commonly known as the Rock Steady Crew. The group started up in the early 1970s while many members of the crew still were in grammar school. They developed a powerful style of dance and a close group of friends that would last them through high school and on into the future. By 1978, the group had gotten together to throw big parties that lasted into the early hours of the morning. People came from all over to see the group perform and to dance with them. The Freshest Kids got their name from their favorite movie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\nThe Freshest Kids included rappers like DJ Charlie Chase, Grandmaster Flash, and Kool DJ Herc. The group was active until the early 1980s, when they began to go their own separate ways. DJ Charlie Chase left to pursue college, and Grandmaster Flash and Kool DJ Herc began working together. Flash took his"

        "instruction": "Is the US border open to Canada?",
        "output": "Is the US border open to Canada?\nNo. Canadians who do not carry proper passport identification (one that includes a visa for the US) will be denied entry at the US border, even if they have a residence card or a TRV (temporary resident visa) from a Canadian Immigration Office.\nAre the border crossings open 24 hours a day?\nYes. There are very few border crossings that are closed (or open for limited hours) from 11:00 pm to 5:00 am from Sunday through Thursday, and 11:00 pm to 8:00 am on Saturday and Sunday.\nCan I import a car via the Peace Bridge or the Rainbow Bridge?\nCan I drive into the United States and just stay for the weekend?\nNo. There is a rule where visitors to Canada, and citizens of other countries, must enter Canada from an international airport, seaport or designated entry point. Exceptions are made for business representatives who have prearranged work or activities that will take at least 24 hours in Vancouver, or for persons who have been granted refugee status.\nCan an automobile be shipped into Canada from the United States?\nYes. To ship your automobile to Canada, you must contact a licensed customs broker, freight forwarder and/or international shipping company.\nCan I re-enter the United States if I just briefly return to Canada?\nYes, you can re-enter the United States provided that you are holding a valid US visa and return with the purpose of residing in the United States.\nCan I use an electronic (paperless) passport?\nNo. An electronic passport that conforms to the international standards is not recognized by US immigration authorities. The US requires those who are entering from overseas destinations to carry a passport with a readable machine-encoded graphic and a biometric marker.\nCan we drive from Canada to Mexico?\nYes. The Canadian customs border crossings and the US customs border crossings are near each other along the border, and there are very few places you cannot drive between the two countries. However, there are a number of border crossings, many of which have very low volumes of traffic, in Northern Canada where crossings are not open during the winter, and in the Yukon and Nunavut Territories where crossing points are either closed or open for very limited hours.\nWhat forms of IDs are needed to cross the US/Canada border?\nEvery US and Canadian border crossing point requires an identification document that includes a picture of the traveler, signature and biographic information. Valid identification documents for US citizens entering Canada are passports (including US passport cards), a Trusted Traveler Program card, and a US military ID, and for Canadian citizens entering the US: passports (including Canadian passport cards), a Nexus card, enhanced driver‚Äôs license, permanent resident card, temporary resident card, and a BCCI card. A birth certificate or other proof of age document is required for Canadian and US citizens age 18 and below entering the other country. An original or photocopy of a Canadian birth certificate or birth record is usually sufficient as proof of age.\nWhat types of visas do we need to travel between Canadian cities and US cities?\nThe following types of visas are no longer required for travel between Canadian and US destinations.\nMost temporary visas for US citizens, including the TN visa for Canadian citizens entering the US for business or pleasure, are accepted for travel throughout Canada.\nStudents who have a valid student/exchange visa issued by a Canadian educational institution can travel throughout Canada and attend classes at any Canadian school or educational institution.\nDependents (spouses and children of Canadian citizens or permanent residents) who hold a valid Canadian immigration document, including those who hold a temporary visa that is valid for another country, can travel anywhere in Canada.\nHow do I travel from Canada to the US via airline?\nInternational airlines that serve both the US and Canada are considered international carriers. These include airlines such as Air Canada, United Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Delta Airlines, and other major carriers.\nInternational passengers traveling between the US and Canada (as well as between any two countries in North America) are generally not required to pass through an Immigration checkpoint at landing. Customs Officers, however, are on site and are authorized to inspect travel documents and conduct searches of the passenger and his or her belongings for prohibited items and goods intended to be smuggled across the border.\nPassengers traveling to Canada from the US, as well as onward travelers who are originating their trip"

        "instruction": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?",
        "output": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses? There are few answers because in the current system, regulations give banks a choice to use cash as capital buffer, but they choose to use other liquid assets as buffer. Such buffer cannot be used to offset potential losses, but it can be used to repay additional deposits to depositors by banks because banks are allowed to repay deposits, but not allot deposits to offset losses.\nSuch buffer can also be used to pay dividends to shareholders. This is what banks did during the crisis, when they had to replenish cash buffer. Cash buffers can also be drained to repay depositors, when losses are incurred.\nThe point is, whatever liquid assets are used by banks as capital buffers, such assets cannot offset losses and banks will have to suffer losses which they can easily absorb thanks to the \"too big to fail\" status.\nBut that is not all. During the crisis, some banks had cash buffer below the requirement, some had negative cash buffer. Such buffers were reduced by banks to repay depositors and to meet regulatory requirements. This was not illegal and it was done by banks, which is not surprising. However, when all other liquid assets were drained by banks, their cash buffers were used to repay depositors. That is when it got interesting. Some deposits were repaid with cash, while other deposits were repaid with bank equity shares. What is the difference between cash repayment and bank equity repayment? As long as cash is used, cash is repaid. The repayment does not make any difference to the depositors, because as soon as they repay their cash deposits, they get back their cash in the form of payments. However, the deal becomes interesting when repayment is made in bank equity shares.\nFirst of all, bank equity share is an equity share with an equity value which can't go beyond the total value of the bank. There is a ceiling on the equity value (in India, on banks) and that ceiling is 5 lakh rupees. A bank equity share, theoretically, has value of 5 lakh rupees and more. On the other hand, cash has value which can actually go beyond the 5 lakh rupees, theoretically.\nThere are 2 factors which can make bank equity shares less lucrative as compared to cash.\nFirst factor is value. With some banks having equity shares worth 5 lakh rupees, their equity shares are not very lucrative, even if they don't have losses. They are hardly worth 5 lakh rupees, which is hardly 5 lakh rupees, considering that the average earning of shares of some well performing banks is over 10 thousand rupees per share, at least in Indian scenario. Even for a bank with value of even 1 crore rupees (10 times the value of average bank), the value of bank equity share can be just about 5 lakhs.\nSecond factor is value of losses for losses. If a bank has losses, its equity shares can get even less value than cash and could potentially lose value if losses occur.\nFew banks actually repay deposits with bank equity shares. I couldn't find any specific study on this, but there are some news reports on this which are available on the internet. For example, read this news report here . As per it, ICICI Bank had the option to transfer surplus cash into Tier I capital and the decision was supposed to be a win-win. It had a choice between issuing equity shares to raise Tier I capital at the face value of Rs 10 and to transfer the cash surplus to Tier I capital. The choice was to issue equity shares because it could issue equity shares for a face value of Rs 10, the value of each share not going beyond 5 lakhs. However, if the bank chooses to transfer cash surplus into Tier I capital, its Tier I capital will get bigger, but cash buffer also gets bigger. Thus, its Tier I capital / equity ratio will also go up. This is how the decision was touted to be win-win, since both Tier I ratio and the Tier I capital goes up and it comes at a no cost. However, what actually happened was different from what was touted to be the case. When the bank decided to issue equity shares, the bank had cash buffer of 26,387 crores, which at its face value goes up to 6 la"

The Senate and House will vote on the so called Congressional Review Act, a rarely used procedure that will allow lawmakers to overturn regulations the new administration may impose. The current law of the land governing broadband is from 2015, signed by Obama, which reclassified broadband providers as common carriers. This allowed net neutrality rules from 2015 to remain in place, though the FCC under Ajit Pai has moved to undo them. Pai has claimed he can preserve a free ‚Ä¶ Continue reading Congress to Hold Final Hearings on Net Neutrality\nAjit Pai Is Now FCC Chairman, Internet Freedom Moves Closer to Obsolescence\nNovember 3, 2017 November 3, 2017 Matthew\nRepublican Ajit Pai has been approved as the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, replacing Tom Wheeler. Pai will likely speed through the repeal of the net neutrality rules, which is one of the cornerstones of internet freedom. Pai has opposed net neutrality for several years and was the driving force in the commission‚Äôs 2015 attempt to roll back net neutrality. Ajit Pai is a former lawyer with Verizon Communications, and later worked as a policy advisor for Senator Ted Cruz from Texas, and as a senior official with the agency he‚Äôs now heading.

Members of the House and Senate will vote on the so-called Disapproval Resolution under the Congressional Review Act. If it is successful, it will allow Congress to overturn regulations enacted by the Federal Communications Commission. Republican Congressman Bob Latta, who chairs the communications and technology subcommittee, said he doubts the measure will pass, given the Democrats‚Äô opposition and support by many Republicans. If the measure is successful, the regulations enforcing neutrality would be eliminated, and the internet service providers would be allowed to slow down, block or charge websites for faster access to consumers.

Yet her hopes of a tranquil future are soon quashed when a dangerous vampire‚ÄîCharles, the ruthless leader of the local blood-drinking society‚Äîdemonstrates the true extent of his hatred for Vickie by abducting her and draining her of her blood. As Vickie lies on the brink of death, her lover, investigator Nick Knight, scours Cleveland as well as his own past for the key to rescuing her. But when he enters the shadowy underworld of vampires to hunt down Charles and free Vickie, he discovers a dark and dangerous world where nothing‚Äîand no one‚Äîis as it seems, and he finds himself squarely in the crosshairs.\nThe Exile (The Avatar)\nThe Crystal Shard: A Forgotten Realms Novel (The Avatar)\nWith a New Introduction by the Author It is the third millennia.

I'm thinking of what to do/study during this year until my program starts.\nYou said you were in computational neuroscience with your current degree. If that is so, I think the best thing you could possibly do is continue to do that during that year. As for what you should do exactly, that would depend on what you particularly want to focus your research on, for example, if you want to focus on learning and memory you should try to spend some time studying psychology and psychiatry, but if you are most interested in what is actually happening in the brain and how your research will influence that, studying physiology and neuroanatomy would be more appropriate and so on. If you are unsure what you would like to focus on, I think the best thing to do would to be to talk to some professors and graduate students in your field and ask them for their thoughts on what would be a good way to spend your time before starting your graduate program. Maybe even asking a professor or graduate student that would be a good match as a future research advisor might help you to get more perspective on that, but even if they are not a good match as research advisors, a large number of them are always happy to provide guidance for students that want to learn more about their fields and so they should have a number of useful suggestions. Good luck!\nThank you so much for the advice! Very helpful\nYou're welcome! If you ever have any more questions or have ideas for how I could answer your question better, please let me know and I'll be happy to add to it and see if I can expand my answer to be more helpful.

In an effort not to have this post come out too close to the real date, I‚Äôm going to use the time to discuss some of the exciting things that we have planned for next week. Keep your eye (or five) peeled as the week progresses for details of giveaways and competitions, and some blog posts to accompany our first monthly writing challenge .\nSpeaking of challenges, we have a lovely one for you, dear readers. Next week sees the start of our Bloggers‚Äô Own Challenge, where you‚Äôre invited to post something of your own ‚Äì whether its creative, academic or even humourous -anything from fiction to poetry, creative non-fiction to personal essays, and even more abstract stuff like graphic art. We‚Äôre going to be giving updates on the Bloggers‚Äô Own challenge every Friday in the hope that it encourages more of you to jump in.\nLast week, I talked about creativity in writing and the benefits of playing with ideas to develop your own style. This week, we‚Äôre going to be looking at the different between story telling and story writing. The difference, for me, is the way the story progresses, and how you structure your ideas. Storytelling is something we all do when we talk to people, and is something that we develop naturally over time and by having conversations with those around us. Storytelling is the backbone of all narrative ‚Äì the idea of telling a story. Storytelling isn‚Äôt always as detailed as something you could write. The basic framework is what makes it a story ‚Äì characters, conflict, plot, and resolution.\nStory writing is different from storytelling in that it is structured and organised into a narrative framework that will ensure the story progresses and doesn‚Äôt meander or take detours. An example of this is the idea of the exposition, rising action, climax and resolution. This is the basic framework that we follow when writing to ensure that the story stays coherent.\nWe think these two differences complement each other and can work well together, depending on the piece you‚Äôre working on. While storytelling can be exciting and unpredictable, story writing gives you control and structure, and helps to ensure your ideas are communicated clearly and don‚Äôt become muddled or confusing.\nBlog\tblogger, blogging, community, creativity, experience, fiction, ideas, journal, learning, mindset, personal, prose, story, thoughts, writer, writing\tLeave a comment\nFebruary 8, 2018 February 27, 2018 A.G.

They sell what they can and they make the profits they can to ensure the survival (and profit) of their companies.<br>2) The food being sold has more calories than it once had. And when this is combined with the fact that it takes less and less exercise to achieve and maintain good health, we can expect that the rate of obesity will continue to rise unless action is taken to arrest it.<br>3) The caloric density (the quantity of calories per given weight of food) will mean that the more food you consume, the more you tend to get fat. This is because foods with high caloric density are more likely to lead to 'compaction' of the body fat tissue as more calories are consumed than expended. In some cases this compaction can lead to permanent (and life-threatening) changes to the person physiology.<br>4) Nutrient-poor foods can lead to malnutrition. Malnutrition has a direct impact on mortality as well as reducing the health and life spans of many sufferers. Malnutrition can also lead to cognitive impairments (such as reduced intelligence) and other disorders such as eczema, irritable bowl syndrome, arthritis, high cholesterol and many others.<br><br>So, although food stuffs may contain 'calories', if they are poor in nutrients and do not provide appropriate amounts of vitamins and minerals necessary for health and proper functioning, they can lead to conditions such as obesity, malnutrition, and other diseases. Therefore, an 100g of calories in unhealthy, low-quality food may not provide the same benefits as 100g calories in a food which is nutritious - this is because the value of the other nutrients consumed may provide far more health benefits and reduce the chances of disease. Some research has indicated that a 100g calorie 'diet' of highly nutritious food (such as fruits and vegetables) can improve health and reduce obesity better than a diet of high-calorie foods consisting of processed foods such as potato chips, corn chips, pizzas, donuts, sugary foods, etc.<br>Even the calories consumed may contribute to disease in addition to other nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and others. Research has shown that certain nutrients can reduce the chances of developing various different diseases. However, the negative effects can be magnified if the appropriate nutrients are not consumed. For example, the lack of vitamin C-rich foods (ie oranges) can lead to a less-than-adequate intake of vitamin C and therefore increase the blood levels of free radicals in the blood which are associated with health problems such as heart disease and cancer.<br>Foods with high calorie content can also lead to 'obesity of the wallet' if you end up buying more food which contains more calories than you need to consume in order to maintain an appropriate body mass index. So, if you end up eating more calories than you need, it is likely that the calories consumed will exceed the calories expended for all the energy (physical and mental)"

        "output": "Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister and can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes. What do they each have to spend? We'll count up how much they each can spend on a 90-day card at the end of this article.\n\"Mom's on Social Security and Dad's on disability, but we have so much more money than we really need,\" said Navina, who's a junior in high school. \"I don't know how the parents do it. It's like they're constantly scrambling to find money for their bills - and trying to save for retirement.\"\nWhen Navina was 6, she started an envelope system with her mom's birthday money. \"I put 10 percent in my college money and 30 percent in my big-girl money account. I also put money into my savings account for retirement, and finally, I spent the other 60 percent however I wanted,\" she said.\nNavina is one of countless teenagers who have mastered an aspect of personal finance or money management - in this case budgeting, saving, and making purchases with a money-management goal in mind. At age 9, Navina also understood that she did not necessarily need to buy something just because she had a gift card or store credit to use up.\nNavina and her sister also have a joint bank account so that they can pay each other, or the family dog (who receives a monthly allowance), in a simple, seamless transaction. If they earn money - for example, babysitting or getting an allowance - they put 10 percent of it in a college fund. \"We're taking on more responsibility and more independence as we get older,\" said Navina. \"I really like that about the college money plan.\" In addition, Navina learned how to do her own taxes when her parents weren't available. \"I'd rather not talk about the last time I had to file my taxes, I was so frazzled and lost,\" she said. \"Now I have a system, so I'm fine.\" Like most teenagers, Navina also does online banking, but she relies on her mom to do the main transactions. It would take her too long to do it all by herself.\nNavina's younger sister, who is only 12, has learned about and gotten involved with managing some family accounts as well. \"I have an idea what my sister is doing, but it seems like she's getting into a lot of debt with all her online retail purchases,\" Navina said, referring to Navina's sister, who's a sophomore in high school. \"I help her by giving her a credit score and budget advice, but she's stubborn about her shopping habits. Then again, I was the same way at that age, so I don't hold it against my sister.\"\nFinancial advisers agree that there's a direct correlation between money management experience in teens and their ability to manage their finances successfully once they become an adult. One financial advisor even suggested that learning finance management skills in your teens - and developing the right money habits - may help you be better positioned to retire earlier and spend your entire financial legacy.\nNavina's father is an accountant, so he has helped her sister learn how to manage the money her family receives from a variety of sources, such as a trust account funded by her grandfather, insurance benefits, and disability payments. \"My dad taught her how to do payroll, manage a bank account, and file tax returns, and now she's learned enough to teach me some things,\" Navina said. \"I think she's a little smarter than me and better at math as well, especially when it comes to banking.\"\nWhile Navina and her sister have taken on some of the more technical aspects of managing their families' money, they've each embraced a money management concept that the other one has yet to address: saving and reducing debt. Navina has always been a saver and is saving a lot of money for college. \"I like to have some cash reserves, so that if something goes wrong, I'll be prepared - and so that there aren't any huge surprises like if a car breaks down or if something gets stolen,\" she said. \"I have about $4,000 in savings and an additional $6,000 in a long-term college fund. My sister takes a smaller approach to saving money, but at least she's saving something,\""

I lived in Japan from 1995-1996 as a US Army Officer. I absolutely loved my time there and could see myself living there for a lot longer than the 1 year that I was stationed there. I was stationed in Tsuchiura in Ibaraki prefecture but spent a fair bit of time traveling outside the Tokyo-Ibaraki area.\nI was wondering if you could please share with me the process for becoming a residing foreigner in Okinawa where it seems there isn‚Äôt as much information/help available as there is for Tokyo and Yokohama.\nI‚Äôve always wanted to go to Okinawa since I first visited in 1989. We have done short jaunts to Miyako-jima, Yonaguni-jima, Ishigaki jima and Ishiki-jima, but I really want to go back to do more extensive traveling throughout the islands. My main goal is to go back someday and explore the entire island including some of the more remote islands like Tokashiki-jima.\nThank you for visiting my site and for your kind words of encouragement! I was also stationed in Japan in 1999 (Yokohama) and loved every minute of it! I could tell that you enjoyed the time you spent there in 1995-96!\nWhen you‚Äôre ready to plan a move to Okinawa, I would recommend finding some information about it on the internet. That way, you can do a lot of the research yourselves before coming to Japan. I would also consider contacting a Japanese friend or family member to see if they have any advice for you. That could potentially make the transition a lot smoother!\nHave fun exploring Okinawa! Be safe and, as always, if you have any other questions about living in Japan or visiting for the first time, feel free to reach out to me!\nHey there. I am thinking about a job opportunity in Okinawa. Just wondering how you came across a place to stay. I mean‚Ä¶how did you manage to find a job AND a place to stay? Would you recommend a homestay program or is it not worth it?.\nI had this idea that you had to be with a family in order to find a place to stay. But I do not know if that is the case.\nSorry for my english I am from Austria.\nThank‚Äôs for your kind words. I would recommend starting off"

        "output": "define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op' that translators don't recognize.\nFurthermore, people with limited knowledge in certain languages may also translate your document incorrectly.\nHuman translators can help you to avoid this and other types of errors. Human translators have the capability to understand your text and translate it into a new language appropriately.\nHaving a human translator review your translations may also help you protect your business by preventing translation errors that could damage your business reputation. You could avoid this by hiring a professional human translator to review your translations before finalizing them.\n3. Accurate and accurate translations\nAll language translation tools are not created equal. Some tools have more accuracy than others.\nTranslation software is a helpful tool, but as stated above, a new language may be unrecognized by the tool, which could result in many errors. Even if the software recognizes the new language, there may still be some inaccuracies in the translation.\nHuman translators have a higher degree of accuracy than translation software and can handle a new language. Human translators use different tools and also have more skill levels to work with different texts and understand different language structures and formats, allowing them to provide translations that more accurately reflect the original document.\n4. High quality translations\nIf your document is being translated for important purposes, you may face difficulties and repercussions if you use imperfect language translations, such as poor grammar, inaccurate wording, and sentence translation errors. Language translations that are not accurate can have negative impact on your business because they could mislead your clients.\nHuman translators can give you more professional translations than translation software. A human translator can better maintain the quality and style of the original translation for a higher quality reading experience. For example, a human translator can preserve original word breaks, sentence structures, and grammar that make them better suited to work with different types of text and preserve their original meaning.\n5. Ease of use and availability\nWhile it may seem easier to use translation software, in reality it can be more complicated to use than you might think. For example, it usually takes a while to learn to use a particular translation software, and it can take a while to understand how to configure the tool to translate the specific document you want to translate. Some tools require users to set their preferences, configure documents, and review options before the translation tool is ready to use.\nHuman translators are generally more simple to use than most translation software, as they do not require the time and effort it takes to learn to use their tools. You can simply send your document to the translator and get your translation started quickly.\nAll things considered, human translators can generally be easier to use and provide faster translation services than translation software. A human translator can provide faster and more accurate translations, allowing you to make better decisions with your documents when you urgently need them.\nIs the human translation good for your company?\nIf you are looking for a more reliable, flexible and fast translation service, you may want to consider the advantages of human translators.\nHuman translators have the ability to produce better and higher quality translations than most software tools. Human translators also offer more language and cultural expertise, making them more adept at handling texts of a variety of content and formats.\nBy allowing you to choose the right human translator for your document, as well as the languages and subject matter you require, Human Proofreading and Translation can help you make more informed business decisions based on reliable translations.\nGet your human translations today!\nPosted by Editor on 09/05/2019 | Permalink | Comments\n5 ways Human Proofreading and Translation helps businesses\nIf your business wants to expand to new markets or reach a wider audience, having quality translations of your website, product descriptions, terms and conditions, and other documents is very important. Otherwise, your business may be limited by having non-native language speakers unable to understand your content.\nIn many cases, businesses must rely on human translators to translate the materials they need for their businesses to work properly.\nHuman translations provide companies with a variety of benefits for their businesses, including increased global reach of their business and greater appeal to foreign markets.\nBelow are five ways Human Proofreading and Translation can help businesses reach new markets and expand to new audiences through quality, human translations.\nHuman translations can help you increase your visibility to overseas markets.

Work has always evolved, Santens argues, and he challenges our acceptance of the \"endless supply of low skilled and menial labor\" as the norm, pointing to examples in history where it became unacceptable to exploit workers by withholding their basic needs while also holding them to strict hours and harsh working conditions. He predicts that work will cease to exist in the future. \"Work and wage-labor are an experiment in how to make us compliant and obedient. We are on the path to replacing that experiment with an entirely new social fabric, and eventually, the world won't need any of it anymore\", Santens writes. The article is an interesting read, and if you want to delve further into this world of the future, you can read Santens' other post on the subject titled \"When Technology Makes Work a Pleasure\". Source: Scott Santens, \"The End of Work, and What It Means for Society\"; www.scottsantens.com; Dec. 29, 2015. Work and the future of work has been on my mind lately, as I have been researching jobs, careers, and industries that will be needed to replace the occupations that will be phased...\n\"The Future of Work\"\n\"The Future of Work\" (2013) is a fascinating and comprehensive book by the Center for the Next Workforce, an initiative of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The book compiles the findings of a 6-month workforce forecasting project where economists and other experts studied the changing and challenging landscape of work in the future. According to the report, we will see \"changes in job roles, skill requirements, employer needs, and the nature of work itself\". The report discusses how the nature of work is changing, and it touches on the issue of long-term unemployment. The book points out that most of the jobs created in recent decades \"required little education or specific skills, such as factory jobs in the 1950s, clerical in the 1980s, or call center jobs a decade ago\". But today we are seeing job creation taking place in areas (such as health care, technology, and finance) that require \"knowledge, specialized skills, and training\". The report cites the McKinsey Global Institute's findings on the impact of automation on employment, pointing out that some 30 percent of the job functions can be automated and replaced by machines. Jobs that are more likely to be automated include data processing, transportation, and manufacturing. One important recommendation of the report is to prepare the workforce for the new challenges and responsibilities that it..."

I wasn't used to this kind of thinking.\nAnd when I became a teacher I realized that visualization is key. Many of my students started to write better when I assigned them to write about characters they knew well. They just needed to know they were supposed to write about the characters and tell their stories. They didn't need a detailed instructions on how to write.\nHere is a free tip for students: imagine your audience while writing!\nThe best advice I can give for writing is to start and never stop. Write about anything and everything that comes to mind. Write it all - good and bad - but NEVER STOP. Write all day and at night. Then re-write it. It's the easiest way to improve your English writing skills. And remember that practice makes perfect!\nLabels: writing tips\nI have an assignment due on Friday. It is due on Friday.\nLilly: I know!

If these civilizations wish to endure they must have a solid foundation on which to build, and the capacity to adapt in times of crisis. Yet, too often, we take our planet's capacity to support life for granted.\nHow to Build a Sustainable Earth examines the factors that allow the Earth to maintain a climate suitable for life, in other to highlight the urgent need for the implementation of changes that will allow the Earth to continue to sustain human activities, and to support future populations. The book focuses on the Earth as one entity, rather than as a collection of separate nations, and assesses the challenges facing the planet and the solutions that may be applied to remedy these challenges. It begins with an analysis of the physical elements that shape the Earth's climate and support life, including water, energy and raw materials. From there, it examines the impact of human activity on the planet in terms of climate disruption, pollution and resource depletion. The book also considers other challenges that have the potential to affect the sustainability of the Earth, including food shortages, mass extinction events, and conflicts over resources.

It would also aid in building the confidence required to make a good first impression, and earn respect from the community.\nThis section of the guide serves as a beginner‚Äôs guide to Reddit and introduces some of the essential terms you might encounter if you are new to the platform.\nReddit is the world‚Äôs largest online community, with over 330 million registered users creating posts on various topics. These posts can be found under different subreddits, each dedicated to a specific topic or theme, like r/funny (humor), r/video games (games), r/gifs (animated GIFs), and r/technology (tech news & culture).\nOne of the most popular subreddits of the platform is r/IAmA (‚ÄúI am a‚Äù), in which members of the community interview and engage with different people from all walks of life in an attempt to learn more about their interests and passions. Reddit also operates an exclusive subreddit for its employees and regular contributors known as r/redditinsider.\nReddit‚Äôs primary source of revenue is advertising on the platform. Some of the most popular advertisers you might encounter on Reddit include Amazon, Spotify, and Netflix. Reddit has also launched several apps and games over the years, the most popular of which is Hearthstone.\nReddit is a place for people to submit content, which is then organized into subreddits, which are essentially subcategories of the platform. Submissions can include links to other articles, images, videos, or even just short text posts. Subreddits are moderated by their respective community members and the community as a whole. Posts do not appear on Reddit in a chronological order; instead, they are sorted into ‚Äúspheres,‚Äù and appear based on what you are interested in.\nGold is one of the two types of currency that can be used to purchase various stuff and custom content on Reddit. Users can gain Gold by either buying it for cash using a third-party website or by being rewarded for submitting good content or participating in discussions. However, Reddit Gold is not tradable with other users like Gold in World of Warcraft. You can only spend Gold if you purchase a subscription to various websites or buy specific content for your own use.\nThe other type of currency on Reddit is called Karma. Similar to Gold, users can earn Karma for submitting good content or participating in discussions. However, the community members can only give Karma as an upvote or reward, and members cannot use Karma to make purchases.\nKarma can also be earned by voting for the best content in a vote thread of a community. Community members and upvote contributors can cast their votes and share which posts they think are the best, and each week the top-voted posts of the current week can be rewards 100 Karma points to each user who voted in that vote thread.\nThere are two main types of rewards on Reddit: giftable rewards, such as Amazon giftcards, which can be bought with Reddit Gold, and non-giftable rewards, such as artwork and customized pieces of content, which can only be earned with Karma or purchased with cash.\nWhile Reddit Gold and Karma are not the same, they work in"

        "output": "hat would be the reason for the popularity of youtube compared to other video sharing websites? In my opinion youtube is simply a better website to watch videos on. The other websites were also very popular, but the quality of videos were not good enough. Also it was very easy to watch youtube videos because the youtube site was made very user friendly. Also the youtube is simply a better site to read because this site allows you to read what the user wrote in his/her own words. Because of these reasons, all of youtube's users can say for sure that youtube is a better website to watch videos on.\nI think that the reason for the popularity of YouTube is because a lot of people love to watch other peoples lives. A lot of people are like me and enjoy watching videos about things that they don't do in their life, and they are like to be in other peoples shoes for a bit by watching how they live their lives.\nI think people watch YouTube because they think it's fun. They are just looking for something to entertain them.\nI think the reason why they are popular is because the videos are hilarious. I know people who get addicted to watching funny videos. Every time I would be bored or I would be looking for something to do, I would look up a hilarious video on YouTube. It really entertains me and it is always funny to watch.\nI think YouTube has become quite a popular website for a few reasons. One being, people seem to love funny videos. One day my friend suggested that I check it out. I was surprised by many of the funny videos that were posted, so I became an avid user of the site. Another reason is people seem to love to create their own videos. YouTube seems to be a fun way to express your creativity. Finally, YouTube is a good place to find all types of information about various subjects. I love to do research online, so YouTube is a great resource for that."

        "instruction": "antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called",
        "output": "antennas that transmit an equal amount of energy in the horizontal direction are called equidistant antennas. When a source antenna sends pulses, each of the receivers in the equidistant array records only the number of pulses received during a pulse, which is denoted by an integer n. As each receiver records the number of pulses received over the time-interval of the pulse (which is a fraction of a second), it is evident that if the source antenna makes multiple pulses per second, then the receivers recording the number of pulses received over a certain period of time are likely to experience some data loss, so it is not possible to record exactly how many pulses were received by a receiver with a sufficiently small time-interval. Suppose that the source antenna sends pulses at intervals of 2 milli-seconds (ms). The number of pulses received by a receiver located at a distance of 5 km from the source antenna over a period of time of one second is recorded. What is the minimum time-interval for which it is possible to record the number of pulses received?\nWhat is the minimum time-interval for which it is possible to record the number of pulses received with a confidence of 95%? Assume that a receiver is located at a distance of 20 km from the source antenna and that the receiver sends its position to the source antenna with a confidence of 95%.\nSuppose that the receiver sends its position to the source antenna with a accuracy of 0.1% every second. In addition, suppose that the frequency of the signal from source antenna is such that a single pulse (with a duration of 2 ms) from this signal will reach the receiver in the time-interval of 1 s. What is the minimum time-interval needed for a receiver to record exactly how many pulses were received over a period of time of 1 s with a confidence of 95%?\nIt is not possible to record the number of pulses received with a confidence of 95% with a time-interval of 2 ms.\nIf the sender has a confidence of 95% that a receiver is located at a distance of 20 km from the source antenna, then what is the confidence of the receiver in regard to the source antenna's position when it sends its position to it every second?\nThe receiver's confidence level in regard to the source antenna's position is 90%.\nSuppose that the source antenna sends the first pulse at 0:00:01 and the second one at 0:00:02. Suppose further that the receiver receives the first pulse at 0:00:04. What is the time interval between the sending of the first and second pulse?\nSuch time-interval between the sending of pulses at the same frequency is called as the pulse-repetition interval (PRI).\nSuppose that the receiver receives the signal over a time-interval that does not correspond to an integer number of pulses. What is wrong from the following table?\nThe receiver receives the signal over a time-interval that does not correspond to an integer number of pulses. Then, if you multiply this value to the pulse-repetition interval, you get no integer numbers. Therefore, the correct table is.\nWhat is the pulse-repetition intervall with 20 pulses per second?\nSuppose that the source antenna sends a signal whose frequency is a hundred times the pulse-repetition interval. If a receiver is located 25 km away from this source antenna, what is the time period for which it will record the number of pulses received?\nThe number of pulses sent per second is 100. The distance between the source and receiver is 25 km. The pulse-repetition interval is 1 ms. Thus, the number of pulses received per hour is 3600*25/100 = 900 pulses.\nThus, the receiver records 900 pulses in one hour.\nWhat is the pulse-repetition intervall with 20 pulses per second, a frequency of 500 Hz, and a minimum time- interval of 0.01 ms?\nFind the distance from the source antenna of a signal with PRI = 0.01 ms when 20 pulses per second are transmitted.\nA source antenna sends a signal whose frequency is ten times the pulse-repetition interval. If it is transmitted 200 pulses per second, what"

How far north will it be?\n4 Over three thousand years ago, there was a city in China called Chengdu. Chengdu was one hundred fifty miles from the Tibetan border, and it was a place of peace. The people were happy with their lives. It was a place where travelers, artisans, and people from the countryside came to sell their wares, make peace, or just meet friends. There were small temples at the center of the town. Some of the temples were new, but there were some in Chengdu from almost five hundred years before. What was unusual about the temples in Chengdu was their location over the grave sites of ancient people. In some cases, the skeletons were buried right on top of what had once been the street or plaza outside the temple. But the street or plaza had been long covered by dirt and later by construction. In those days, people believed that the dead could help people in their lifetimes because dead people had knowledge. The ancient people made tombs in the temple so that they would always be remembered and honored, and they believed that the temple became a meeting place in the afterlife of great ancestors. Temples could serve as places for trade and commerce, places where people could tell stories, and places for people to seek solace and worship a god. Over time, people started to associate different temples with different gods, and in this way, the different temples came to represent different forms of prayer and worship. In one corner of the temple was a large building. It was a meeting place where people from all parts of the kingdom could gather to make peace, talk about their lives, or worship the god of their particular temple. This was how the people in Chengdu had lived for hundreds of years. For hundreds of years, people in Chengdu had lived peacefully among mountains and rivers, under skies that were always so clear and bright. Then, more than two hundred years ago, war began. It seemed like everybody had to fight or go away. For more than forty years, there was fighting everywhere. Some people fought for the king, who wanted to be emperor, and some people fought to keep the king as he was, but all those people were still enemies of each other. Eventually, the war became only about money. In the end, no one knew if they were really fighting for freedom or to gain more land and money. The end never came, and neither did peace. So people kept fighting. More than two hundred years later, it seems like only bad things have happened in Chengdu. The river is polluted and people can‚Äôt swim in it. Most of the mountains are destroyed and their sides are so steep that nobody could live there. There‚Äôs only rock left in the fields, and people‚Äôs homes are falling into the earth. There are hardly any trees left, and all the animals are gone. There are only a few old temples, and it‚Äôs hard to find a friendly face. Even the people from other towns are angry and don‚Äôt want to talk to Chengdu people. There are still places in Chengdu where peace and quiet can still be found, and that is where the story of the temple begins. One woman was looking for a place of peace and calm. One spring day, a little girl was looking for a place to play. The sun was shining, and it felt like spring had arrived. It had snowed and rained more than normal this year, and everything was covered with moss and greenery but still felt damp and fresh.\n5 Over three thousand years ago, there was a city in China called Chengdu.

The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like \"raiders attacked the village\". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative. I'd like to be blown away, so I hope you come up with stuff I haven't thought of. I'm willing to do anything your imagination can come up with. Your backstory does not need to be canon (except for the character's race), but it does need to be plausible. The character does not need to be evil, but they do need to be \"adult\" in their actions and not prone to petty crimes. Also, make sure the backstory fits the class you are playing (i.e. ranger, warrior, monk, etc.) and is not blatantly contradictory to it. Remember to keep the character's race in mind in your backstory and remember that humans are still the most common race in the world. Please review the following Pathfinder race and class links: http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/race?path=/race http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/classAndIndex?path=22462852 The backstory can also involve character \"wanted\" posters (with your character's picture) of the character and the history of their life. This would be used for you to use in game and is part of the backstory. But only include actual wanted posters if they are realistic and actually plausible. If you want more context for a particular section of the biography then by all means I accept it. But try to be concise and remember that the main focus is on a dark and mysterious backstory and not a detailed account of life growing up. The backstory can be for the character at any point in their life as long as it's plausible and doesn't have unreasonably big gaps (i.e. you have the character living in an orphanage when they were a child but then they were a teenager living on their own in the city for no known reason). So make it logical and believable. I will be looking over and judging each entry as it comes out so please include me in the review of your submission! I will rate each submission out of 10 and try to be as objective as possible. The winner will be chosen on Saturday, October 8th 2016. Rules: -The winner will get 1000 pvp orbs (or 5000 if the entry is really good). -No repeated submissions (you can submit multiple entries). -Race must be human (or half-human) for the game to make sense. -I reserve the right to not choose a winner if I believe the contest was flawed in some way. -This contest was originally posted on August 13th 2016 on rpg.net and was moved here to ensure participation.

Maybe you could give away your car trunk for fifty dollars if you really wanted to, if you were in a real hurry, or something like that.

        "instruction": "which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions",
        "output": "which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions into the cell?\nThe answer is A.\nThe most important second messenger in excitable tissues is calcium. Calcium activates synaptic vesicle fusion at the nerve terminal and potassium release from within the nerve terminal. Both these processes are required for neurotransmitter release and thus for the passage of an excitatory signal down the axon of the neuron.\nA nerve cell releases its neurotransmitters into the space between the surface of the nerve cell and that of the axon or next neuron.\nThe process is initiated by the release of calcium ions (Ca++) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The release of Ca+ ions into the cytoplasm of the neuron triggers a cascade of events leading to the release of many neurotransmitters.\nCalcium levels are kept low in the cytoplasm of the cell as a normal steady state and therefore calcium ions are continually released from the Ca++-ATPase at the surface of the ER. These calcium ions are transported across the membrane to the cytoplasm of the cell.\nThe release of calcium leads to the opening and activation of other membrane pores so releasing sodium ions, potassium ions, and eventually glutamine which leads to the release of various other neurotransmitters. This complex process leads to the production of chemicals which transmit a signal between neurons.\nCalcium is released by the fusion of endoplasmic reticulum membranes with the membrane surrounding the vesicles containing neurotransmitters. This stimulates exocytosis and the release of neurotransmitters.\nExocytosis refers to the process of membrane fusion of endoplasmic reticulums with the vesicular membrane. Exocytosis of endoplasmic reticulums triggers release of neurotransmitters and other second messenger molecules that activate synaptic vesicles.\nPhospholipases are enzymes that, released in response to second messenger molecules such as Ca2+, break down membranes and thereby lead to the fusion of ERs with the cell membrane and release of neurotransmitters. Phospholipases are activated by an increase in the intracellular levels of the second messenger calmodulin or by the binding of calcium to calmodulin.\nThe second messenger Ca2+ activates the enzyme phospholipase C which cleaves phospholipids into free fatty acids and inorganic ions. The free fatty acids are hydrolysed from lipid in the membrane of the neuron to produce a messenger molecule of arachidonic acid (AA). AA is converted to a series of metabolites by Œî6 oxidase and Œî5 desaturase enzymes. These include prostaglandin F2Œ± (PGF2Œ±), which is produced during the initiation of an inflammatory response. PGF2Œ± is transformed into a series of metabolic products and some of these activate the production of eicosanoids such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2). This in turn stimulates increased synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes by a complex series of enzyme reactions. PGF2Œ± also activates the release of other neurotransmitters such as substance P, acetylcholine, and glutamate from the neuron.\nAnother series of reactions involves eicosanoids being synthesised from lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase. One product of this is thromboxane A2 which triggers an increase in production of clotting factors from the endothelium, leading to a reduction in the blood flow to areas distant from the source of inflammation. Eicosanoids and cytokines can also have harmful effects on the vascular system if the inflammatory response is not carefully controlled to prevent any local or systemic harm to body organs and tissues.\n1. Nerve fibres that carry pain signals are specialised __________ .\n2. An exogenous signal that triggers the release of neurotransmitters is called a __________.\n3. A ___________is defined as a chemical released by a nerve cell to stimulate or inhibit the response of nerve cells.\n4. ___________ release from a nerve end causes"

        "output": "Draft a ministerial speech outlining the top five benefits that innovation brings to the Australian economy Speaker, in conclusion, innovation holds the key to unlocking the enormous potential that Australian exporters have. Exporters can innovate their products, innovate their way of doing business or innovate their distribution networks. But they have to do it if they are going to succeed in the 21st century and keep Australia‚Äôs economy strong. It really is that simple. Thank you once again for the opportunity to share these views. I can see the time is drawing on, so, in the time I‚Äôve been given I‚Äôll have to close. Thank you. Thank you, Paul.\nMr Sutton : Good afternoon, chair and chair. It is an absolute pleasure to be speaking in the inquiry into the global competitiveness of Australia's food and fibre producers. I am of course a member of the NFF, and, as is often the case here in the hallowed halls of the Senate inquiry, much of my evidence is covered by what we have already said via our comments to the inquiry. In that sense, my remarks are somewhat complementary, and as I said, I will probably repeat much of what Mike Foley's said in his opening testimony earlier.\nI want to begin by commending this inquiry for examining the food value chain. It is long overdue. It is a sector that is hugely important for Australia. I am glad to see in the terms of reference references to innovation and productivity and their role in driving down costs, improving the quality of Australian food and fibre, and improving its competitiveness both domestically and internationally. Those are, of course, areas in which, through its advocacy and its many activities, the NFF has long-expressed interest and has been pursuing.\nThe National Farmers' Federation is the peak industry body representing farmers and people who work on farms throughout Australia. The NFF works, as Mike Foley said earlier, to achieve positive outcomes for all farmers in Australia, and in doing so, deliver benefits to the broader community. As well as being the peak national body representing farmers, the NFF also aims to represent rural people, and I think the NFF does a very good job at achieving that. I should just underline that while I am also speaking about behalf of the NFF, my comments today represent my own opinions, particularly about the evidence I am presenting to the inquiry.\nI am also pleased to see the inquiry's focus on improving agriculture for Australian farmers, and more generally for the Australian economy. It is a subject that the NFF, as I am sure you know, has had a long-standing interest in. As the NFF's deputy chief executive, Stephen Barton, said in his evidence to the inquiry yesterday:\nThe NFF also sees productivity increasing as a fundamental means to improving the economic performance and viability of Australian agriculture and farm businesses. The benefits which these efforts are targeting include increased revenues for producers, more investment in farm businesses, fewer farms losing money (or indeed going broke), a lower-cost supply chain and greater certainty for industry, government and consumers.\nSo, that pretty much covers the NFF's approach to the inquiry‚Äîwhich is really about trying to maximise farmer returns through improved economics and productivity.\nI should underline, of course, that we live in rapidly changing global environment and times, and what matters today was not relevant even 10 or 20 years ago. Globalisation has changed the rules of the game for food producers like never before, and it is clear that the food and fibre sector is no exception. The globalisation of markets has seen increased competition and increased sophisticated market access, and it is becoming more difficult for Australian food and fibre producers to compete on merit in a global marketplace.\nThat creates huge challenges for the Australian industry and the broader agricultural sector in terms of remaining competitive at home and abroad. So it is essential that we remain competitive as a nation and protect our food and fibre security both in Australia and abroad. As well as competitiveness, food and fibre prices are of critical importance to livelihoods and economies across the country. And that's why it is so important to find effective ways to reduce the cost of food production for farmers and ensure price stability for consumers.\nAs far as the NFF is concerned, the national food and fibre system is a critical part of Australia's economy. It is highly diverse, and it is the major agricultural sector. Overall, it employs about one"

        "output": "Is online casino legal in India?\nIt can be, and it should be.\nGambling, especially gambling online, is illegal in India if done without a license. And according to media reports in March 2018, several gambling platforms are illegal in India. Some of the popular casinos websites that operate in India are licensed abroad, which is against the law. This is because the Indian government does not allow foreigners to operate casinos in the country. Thus, most Indian online casinos provide the local players. However, if you look at the other states, the situation is different. In some states, casinos can be legal and open to the public. But these states are limited only to five and the rest do not allow any form of gambling. In such states, it is more difficult to gamble legally in India.\nHow illegal gambling thrives online?\nAccording to a report by the Indian police, the illegal online casinos are operating from foreign destinations, mostly Costa Rica, the United States and European Union countries such as Greece and Spain. Although some sites are based in India and operate abroad, these sites are also licensed abroad.\nAccording to reports by the Ministry of Home Affairs, illegal activities such as online gambling are expanding in new parts of India on a regular basis, especially in the urban areas of the country. This situation is even more worrying when gambling is considered to be illegal in the country. Illegal activities include cyber-crimes such as kidnapping, extortion, money laundering, trafficking and even gambling.\nIndustry experts believe illegal gambling has many harmful effects on the country. These risks include the involvement of organized crime and money laundering through these illegal sites.\nIf you need to gamble online in India, you should be aware that this can lead to illegal activities. As a result, the risk of being cheated and losing money to a fraud is high.\nHow should online gambling in India be legal?\nIf online gambling in India is legalized, there are some rules the government and the court should follow. For example:\nOnly licensed and authorized gambling websites must be allowed. All licenses from international bodies could make these websites legal by law.\nPlayers from other countries should also be allowed to play on these sites. It will contribute to the development and employment of citizens of India.\nThe law should allow online gambling to be carried out in India. This can include all forms of gambling such as casinos, sports betting and lotteries.\nTherefore, gambling should only be legal in India if it is allowed by the government and the court in accordance with the law. If you want to gamble online, you must be sure to do it on a site that has a gambling license and only on the official website of the casino.\nPrevious PostHow to Deposit at an Online CasinoNext PostWhat is Gambling on Mobile?"

        "output": "I want to eventually become a plant/manufacturing/production manager, and eventually a Chief Operating Officer. What sort of experience and post-graduate education path would you recommend? Please provide non-obvious and atypical career paths leading to such positions, on top of the classic ones.\nMBA at Cornell, I would guess with 4 years undergraduate prior to that.\nYou have about 16 years to become CEO, assuming that you go straight from college through this.\nYou'll probably want to first work for at least 5-7 years, in various managerial roles. This will give you a wide range of experience and help you get the right background and skills.\nThen a couple of years between 45 and 55 should put you in position to run a company.\nIf you get hired into a company you'd like to run, and the company has the prospect of growing a lot over the next 20 years, you then have a shot.\nIf you're CEO of a public company, you have to go to the board to get it -- unless there's a family member running the company.\nSome of the non traditional tracks are consulting (big strategy firm like BCG, Deloitte, EY, PwC, etc. Or mid-sized ones like Oliver Wynn or LEK), investment banking (sell-side or buy-side), private equity (PE or VC firm) or perhaps the military if that's in your background.\nBut I would think one of theses more traditional tracks would be optimal for getting you there.\nTo a lesser degree, you could start out in operations management and gradually work your way towards a bigger role.\nI agree with the overall career path of operations management and management. A very successful plant manager with proven ability can become production manager and then on to manufacturing manager or VP level in manufacturing.\nThe job as production manager and VP can be done for many years. You never get to ceo unless the company gets acquired and you take the new position.\nThere was a good story about a guy who became CEO who had two years of college, then went into the Army and became a military officer, and then worked his way up the corporate ladder within a defense contractor. They eventually acquired a company who was the CEO (who was old, had many decades experience) and they turned it down, it was a large public firm the military officer knew from his days in defense contracting. But in this case he was in his late 40's when he was CEO of a public company.\nI don't think it would be as quick or easy as that to become CEO of a large firm. You don't become CEO of a Fortune 500 company until you're either retired or 60+ years old. I think it's possible, but the chances of happening in a career is very slim.\nWhat you are going to see more often is a military officer rising to CEO of a major defense contractor and then a few years later moving up to the CEO of a Fortune 500 type company. And this could happen as early as 50 in today's business world.\nI remember a guy who was the COO of a Fortune 100 company for 8 years or so and then moved on to CEO of a smaller lesser Fortune 500 firm. So the career progression is definitely possible, and could happen quicker than the OP thinks."

Anderson\nFebruary 24, 2011 / by Lance Berry / Post Comment\nKevin James Anderson, author of many blockbusters such as his Dark Tower series with Stephen King, his Star Wars series, and his X-Files series, returns with A Plague of Giants. Kevin‚Äôs many fans will be pleased with this book, which continues his tradition of excellence. Kevin J. Anderson is famous for his ability to write long series, and A Plague of Giants is no exception to this. It is the first book in a new series which is going to be made into a role-playing game: it is a medieval fantasy and one of the better examples of this genre available. While other fantasy authors, such as Robert Jordan and George R. R. Martin, choose to make the middle ages look like the Wild West with magical weapons, armor, and technology, Kevin J. Anderson manages to make what most authors would consider a standard fantasy work stand out by choosing an incredibly realistic view which is extremely effective.\nIn this story, the Giants are not the oversized or overpowered people which most fantasy would have, but instead appear like the giants of tall tales. They are huge, incredibly massive animals which tower over the more common humans and elves, but they are not nearly so strong, and are actually quite frail creatures with incredibly delicate bones. This serves to make them extremely intimidating when they first come into the book, because their sheer size is enough to seem quite impressive. But once the main character, a young elven lady has a personal encounter with one, it soon becomes clear that they are quite vulnerable and pathetic when they are not around their own kind. The main strength of these behemoths is their ferocity and their strength in numbers, and it turns out that they are actually quite cowardly and easy to trick and defeat in one-on-one combat, something which is proven throughout the novel."

        "output": "What if people only valued and took pride in the things that were true about themselves? What if they were proud of being themselves? What if they believed in themselves and took responsibility for what they do? What if they were genuine and authentic? What if they were not pretentious and they accepted themselves as they are? What if they understood their strengths and weaknesses and accepted them as part of their personality? What if they accepted themselves and others just the way they are? What if they believed they are worthy by being themselves and just accepting the way they are? What a wonderful world that would be? A world where people value things truly about themselves, love themselves as they are and make the best out of their own qualities.\n5 What is Value in Life Value may be defined as, Value in Life is the worth one puts on oneself along with the beliefs one has about oneself. Value is a central idea in the development of a sense of self and a sense of positive self identity: The degree to which a persons self and other perceptions of oneself are central to self worth, self esteem, and sense of personal identity. The feeling of self-worth is an important one to help us move ahead in life, but if we dont feel worthy in the first place how can we improve ourselves and the quality of our lives and those around us? If we look around, we would see people all around us struggling to find their worth. We would see people all around us hurting each other trying to prove their superiority or gain dominance over each other. We would see people all around us who are trying to compete, who are trying to be better than each other. We would see people all around us who care very little for each other and for this world. We would see people all around us hurting our own self. How do we bring about a change? How do we create a better world? As individuals, we can only bring about a change within ourselves and as an individual if i start valuing the qualities i have then i wont be hurting myself, i would believe in myself and i would start accepting myself as i am. If I value my qualities, then I will start taking care of myself and i will love and respect my own self. I will stop hurting myself and i would stop hurting and abusing people and animals around me. If i believe that i am worthy, and i would value and respect my own uniqueness then i would start accepting the people, animals around me as i am and stop hurting them. I would stop hurting people and animals around me. Then we would see a world where people respect differences and differences would be valued and accepted. Then we would see a world where people would believe in themselves and take care of themselves. Then we would see a world where people stop hurting others and abusing animals around them. There is only one way we can bring a change and that is from within. And when i start respecting and valuing myself then i can start respecting and valuing my fellow beings. When I start respecting and valuing my fellow beings then i can start respecting and valuing nature around me. When I start respecting and valuing nature then i can start protecting nature. When I start protecting nature, then i would be creating a better world for not only myself but for generations to come. When I start respecting nature, i would stop being abusive towards other organisms around me. The quality that matters most to the overall quality of life is your own self-esteem and self-respect. And when you value yourself and respect yourself for who you truly are, you would start accepting things around you as they are and then you would stop feeling abusive and you would start accepting others as they are. The quality of life depends on what you value most in life and when you value most in life, you start respecting yourself, your family, your species, nature and the world around you. Acknowledgments Thank you\n6 It would not be possible for me to create this blog without all the help, guidance and support from my friends, family, teachers, co workers and everyone who shared their views and ideas. Thank you for being there when I needed you. Thank you for your encouragement, faith and support in reaching the success I have today. What is Success in Life? What can you do to feel successful? Most of us think we know the answer to that, but what do you do when you feel like you are not successful? Success to me means, feeling proud of your contributions. Success is being satisfied with yourself and with the way you have lived your life, regardless of how you may think you have done in life compared to others. Success means, finding satisfaction and happiness in all the work you have done and all the challenges you have faced. Success means, finding happiness in the smallest of tasks,"

But hey, I gave it a try. To my own defence, I did manage to bring in a good amount of sales while doing that. However, at the end of the day I decided to do it in more natural ways like writing an article, giving a talk, or writing about my insights which are based on real life experience, facts and figures from my own company. In the end the whole thing boiled down to a question: What were you trying to accomplish by writing such an post?\n01 Aug 2019 00:02 GMT in #r/Entrepreneurship by\n[‚Äì]jordanv_SalesAutomationGrowthMarketing and Social Media-3 points (-1147027) 1 day ago\n[+]Eth_OpsFulfillment-4 points (-348013) 1 day ago (edited)\n1 Aug 2019 00:05 GMT by\n[‚Äì]jordanv_SalesAutomationGrowthMarketing and Social Media-3 points (-365570) 1 day ago (edited)\n[+]Eth_OpsFulfillment-4 points (-333622) 1 day ago\n[+]I-Funded-1 point (+387171) 1 day ago\n[‚Äì]jordanv_SalesAutomationGrowthMarketing and Social Media-3 points (-224024) 1 day ago\n[+]I-Funded-1 point (+387171) 1 day ago (edited)\nI am surprised you are taking me so seriously, all I was trying to say is that as long as we all understand the game it wont lead to any problems. My point was never about any of us, or what we choose to write about, all I wanted to do is shed a light on what is a very competitive industry which only gets more competitive every day. If you consider the people behind those companies and their strategies I guarantee you that they are not your friend, hence why their focus needs to be set on their main priority, which is making lots of money.\nHence why they focus on making their company valuable, and then either sell themselves for big bucks or go public. That is a huge change from where the early entrepreneurial internet industry was back in the 90s, so its only natural that they are going to take advantage and do what is best for their company.\n[‚Äì]jordanv_SalesAutomationGrowthMarketing and Social Media-3 points (-346068) 1 day ago (edited)\n1 Aug 2019 00:05 GMT in #r/Entrepreneurship by\nAll I am saying is that while entrepreneurial tech is an incredible industry that is full of great people that really care about their businesses and the success of their customers, the reality is a lot more complex and full of people who only care about their own gain.

If we go back to the initial post of mine I talked about the way I was marketed to and how things were in this industry decades ago, which I am very grateful for.

        "instruction": "Why does warmth make you feel tired?",
        "output": "Why does warmth make you feel tired?\nA. Warmth and sleepiness are linked in part by the hypothalamus. This sets off a drop in blood pressure that makes us feeling sleepy. Heat also reduces blood flow in skin capillaries, which causes congestion in the peripheral blood circulation ‚Äî this can trigger sleepiness and fatigue.\nQ. Is it safe to consume coconut juice?\nA. Yes, it‚Äôs safe to drink coconut juice and it‚Äôs a great source of potassium and other nutrients. Just make sure the coconut you buy is organic and unopened; the longer the juice has been out, the more nutrients it will lose.\nQ. Is it safe to eat mangoes if I‚Äôm pregnant?\nA. Yes, it‚Äôs safe to eat mangoes while you‚Äôre pregnant. Mangoes contain two substances ‚Äî urushiol and chrysophanol ‚Äî that are commonly thought to cause allergic reactions. However, when they affect people, it‚Äôs most likely because they‚Äôve been sensitized to them. This can happen if mangoes are eaten over an extended period of time, but it‚Äôs not common with a single serving.\nQ. Can we eat mango seeds too? Why do they come out from the mango?\nA. Yes, they‚Äôre edible and good for you. However, many people still throw them away. The mango seed evolved as a defense against pests ‚Äî it‚Äôs toxic to them but safe for us. There‚Äôs no evidence that it‚Äôs unsafe for adults, but mango seed extract can cause damage to human cell cultures, so experts recommend avoiding it.\nQ. Why is mastic good for oral hygiene?\nA. Mastic is a resin produced by the mastic tree, Pistacia lentiscus, native to the Greek island of Chios. It contains antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that kill oral bacteria and treat oral inflammation. Mastic has also been shown to fight bad breath and gingivitis.\nQ. Is it safe to drink green tea while pregnant?\nA. Green tea may be OK to consume in moderation while you‚Äôre pregnant. It‚Äôs best to stick with just one cup a day, as it contains small amounts of caffeine. Green tea may also interfere with iron absorption, so make sure you consume foods high in iron and calcium as well.\nQ. Is it safe to eat cashews while nursing? What about cashew butter?\nA. Cashews are one of the many foods that are safe for nursing mothers to eat, and they can be eaten in large quantities as needed. The same applies to cashew butter; there‚Äôs no reason to limit any amount of it if you like it. However, raw cashews and butter may be unsafe for nursing mothers if they are infected with aflatoxins, as this can lead to liver damage.\nQ. Can oral warts be caused by the human papillomavirus?\nA. Yes, human papillomavirus (HPV) can be transmitted through oral sex and is a common trigger of oral warts. However, the virus can also be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact and can be transferred to oral mucosa as a result. These warts are a form of the HPV infection, but HPV is also linked to cervical cancer and a number of cancers of the head and neck.\nQ. What does it mean if your tongue is red?\nA. A red tongue can be a sign of many health problems, including poor oral hygiene, infection or cancer. Other symptoms may include pain, fever, a change in taste or bad breath. See your doctor as soon as possible if you have any of these symptoms or you‚Äôre worried about your condition.\nQ. Is smoking marijuana while pregnant dangerous?\nA. Using any form of marijuana during pregnancy or breastfeeding may be dangerous since it contains more than 100 chemicals called tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs). THCs are known to harm the developing brain and impair memory, although the effects of using marijuana are still unclear. That said, studies suggest that heavy marijuana use may affect test performance, attention span and memory, in addition to the risk of having an impaired"

        "output": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method.\nClosing of cusp (s). Find the deflected shape: Detail: The shape and distribution of the cusp are determined from the curvature of the surface at the cusp. The effect of flow over a cusp is to deflect the fluid stream and produce a curvature in the surface along which the flow is occurring.\nTo find the shape of the deflected curve, we plot the function d=u r and from it, we can easily determine the radius of curvature at each point. We can also find out the shape of a cusp from the shape of a catenary curve. A catenary is the shape assumed by a cable that is supported at both ends and is able to move freely under the influence of gravity.\nThe result is quite simple: The same is valid of a curve: Catenary curves are the arches used to span wide areas and are a generalization of the parabola. In fact, the parabola lies on a catenary curve and thus shares its properties and shape.\nSimilarly, the shape of a catenary curve and the resultant shape of a curve over a cusp both lie on a parabola. Find the deflected shape: Detail: The curve of the path of the fluid in the direction of the centrifugal force is the parabola and the points of equilibrium of the fluid particles are given by:.\nThe parabolic path is a part of the catenary curve and it is a function of the radius of curvature of the surface over which the fluid stream flows: Detail: The shape of the curve is determined by the sign of the tangential velocity at each point and the flow stream thus takes different shapes depending on the radius of curvature and the tangential velocity in the curve.\nThe graph shows that in a cusp curve, the velocity of the fluid decreases rapidly as it approaches the cusp tip, and there cannot be a stream of fluid over the cusp, as there is no surface to flow over. Detail: The effect is also of the centrifugal force of the fluid particles.\nThe resultant centrifugal force of all the particle must act in same direction and hence there cannot be any stream of fluid particles with a velocity component perpendicular to the curvature of the surface.\nThe direction of the centrifugal force is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the fluid particles and acts as an opposition to the motion of the fluid particles. This results in the formation of waves and hence the flow over cusp curves is not a smooth curve but a wavy pattern, which we call the vortex. The shape of the flow stream thus depends largely on the characteristics of the centrifugal force and the curvature of the surface: Detail: The flow of the stream of fluid over a cusp has resulted in the formation of a vortex, as can be noted from the above figure.\nWe see that there is a pattern of vortices which have arisen over the cusp curve, as there is always a pattern of eddy vortices which come out near the leading edge of any solid body moving through a fluid medium.\nThe following video explains the flow over a cusp: We note that the vortices of the fluid stream over the cusp have produced the vortex effect, which we shall see in more detail a few sections ahead.\nThe flow of the cusp curve has resulted in the formation of vortices and this is a common feature due to the presence of an obstacle in the fluid stream.\nIn a cusp curve, both the magnitude of the tangential velocity which determines the flow over the curve and the magnitude of the centrifugal force which opposes this motion are very important: Detail: We see that in a cusp curve, the magnitude of the tangential velocity increases rapidly up to a maximum value and then decreases rapidly.\nWe thus see that a cusp curve causes the maximum tangential velocity on the flow stream and this is the reason why the fluid stream undergoes the most drastic changes on being exposed to a cusp curve: Detail: We further see that in a cusp curve, the magnitude of the centrifugal force also increases rapidly in the region around the cusp point and then reaches a maximum and thus the force is maximum near the cusp point and is directed in opposite direction of the flow of the stream of fluid.\nHence, in a cusp curve, we also see that the magnitude of the centrifugal force is maximized and thus has maximum tendency to oppose the flow of the stream of fluid and the result is the formation of the vortex"

The Bank interest rate policy: monetary policy, investment in fixed and current assets, fiscal policy and the long-term loan rate. 7.9. The interest rate and inflation. 7.10. The interest rate and money supply. 7.11. The money supply and inflation. The interest rate is a cost of borrowing which depends on the interest rate and on the inflation rate. It is worth to remember that the interest rates on the loan market depend on the supply of and demand from financial institutions for securities denominated in money units. There are the following factors that determine the rate of interest in loan market: 1. The supply of and demand from financial institutions (banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions) for securities which serve to hedge future loan risk in terms of the interest rates on the loan market. 2. The expectations about the rate of interest on the loan market. 3. Loan risk factors (credit default risk, currency risk, economic risk, interest rate risk). It is worth emphasizing that the rate of interest on the loan market represents the market interest rate in the monetary system (in the economy). The market interest rates (both short and long-term) reflect in the loan market the expectations about the future interest rates and loan risk factors. The interest rates on the loan market reflect the expectations about: 1. the future interest rates, inflation, and loan risk factors. 2. the monetary and fiscal policy of the economy which influences the rate of interest in loan market. 3. the economic trends and developments in the economy. The loan market may be divided into short-term loan market (for the period below one year) and long-term loan market (for the investments for up to 7 years). As for the shortterm loan market, its interest rates are influenced by the liquidity factors. The liquidity factors include the following: 1. The cash flow (inflow and outflow) from the investment activities and corporate activities (cash inflow from investment activities and cash outflow from corporate activities). 2. The expected liquidity in the market (the cash outflow from investment activities and corporate activities for one period). 3. The expected liquidity in the market (the cash inflow from investment activities and corporate activities for one period). The long-term loan interest rates reflect the investment trends in the economy and its expectations about financial market risk factors in the coming years (including economic, credit and currency risk factors). It is worth stressing that both short-term and longterm interest rates (and other factors that influence the loan market) reflect in the overall loan market: 1. The inflation rate"

Is there a limit to the amount of hops that can be added?\nA: Hops are added to the brewing process towards the end, after the malt and other adjuncts are added; some breweries like to add hops during the mash process, while other prefer to do so during the boil. The amount of hops depends on the variety and the process; the American and English lagers often contain a lower percentage of hops than the India Pale ale."

The Mount Everest Summary The world can seem like a chaotic place, with millions of people, each claiming to be the next Messiah. One group, however, claims something very different. The Himalayan group does not believe that there is a messiah and that the world is not falling apart. The group does not believe this, but rather believes that God is their own mother and father, which gives them peace and confidence throughout our lives. Everest was the first to conquer Mount Everest on May 29, 1953 and to top the world‚Äôs highest mountains, the 18,892 feet, that stands above sea level near the Nepal-China border. This is also the fifth tallest mountain of earth and also holds the title of world highest mountain. Some of the most unforgettable images from this region is the soaring, snow-capped peaks of K2, Rakaposhi, Spantik, Gasherbrum, and Mt. Everest. Everest is known as the most dangerous mountain on earth and is considered a death zone above 21,000 feet, Everest is the highest mountain in the world with a summit reaching an elevation of 8,848 metres (29,029 ft) above sea level. This elevation was calculated by a 1954 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by Chinese survey. Some measurements give a height of 8,850 metres (29,035 ft). In the spring of 79, the second emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered a huge army to attack and seize the Everest and the army was led by a man called Zuo Qiu. At the time it was called Qin Shan, and it was so challenging that nobody could make it. As Qin Shi Huang's army did not conquer the Everest, the emperor decided to stop the expedition and the army returned to China. The exact name of the mountain in chinese is \"Ê¨¢ÂñúÂ≥∞\" and in the Tibetan language the name is Chomolungma. Chomolungma means \"goddess mother mother goddess\". This was the first recorded attempt in history to reach the Everest summit. In 1921, British explorer George Mallory together with climber Andrew \"Sandy\" Irvine went to the highest mountain in the world, but Irvine was lost in the journey and the duo never returned from the expedition\n22: Afterwards, George Mallory went to Everest to look for his friend and they decided to ascend the mountain. The two died during their climb and, in 1936, the third British expedition began the investigation, which showed that the famous mountaineers died probably because they did not climb to the top, but instead retreated in a hurry. The mountain was so named by George Everest, a Welsh geographer, in 1865. He was part of the British survey team who mapped the Himalayas and in particular Mount Everest. However, the Tibetan name was always known and still used. When the British discovered Everest in 1865, it was known as Peak XV of the Survey of India map published in 1856. It was named after Sir George Everest who headed the Great Trigonometric Survey of India in the mid-19th century. While Everest's name is well liked, others feel that the first mountaineer to reach the highest point should be given credit by name. While no one will object to a mountaineer's name being associated with his Everest peak, for decades mountaineers have argued for years for the inclusion of the original Summitter's name on maps, signage, etc. Everest was the first to conquer Mount Everest on May 29, 1953 and to top the world‚Äôs highest mountains, the 18,892 feet, that stands above sea level near the Nepal-China border. This is also the fifth tallest mountain of earth and also holds the title of world highest mountain. Some of the most unforgettable images from this region is the soaring, snow- capped peaks of K2, Rakaposhi, Spantik, Gasherbrum, and Mt. Everest. The name of the mountain was changed to Sagarmatha after the independence of Nepal in 1962, and the new government decided to keep the name Sagarmatha until 1975,"

The process is never complete, and we never stop learning and improving our skills. However, the following are some of the most important concepts and skills every SEO professional today must learn and apply in order to remain relevant in the industry:\nThis seems to be a rather common problem amongst new SEO specialists ‚Äì they think SEO and link building are completely separate fields and that they have to do one to the exclusion of the other. In fact, the more closely you tie your link building efforts to your SEO strategies, the better results you will get with organic search traffic.\nA huge number of SEO professionals still make this mistake, but it's important to realize that your link building efforts and your organic SEO efforts are two sides of the same coin. The more closely you integrate them, the better results you will get in both cases.\nA lot of people seem to think that SEO is a game that gets played in secret. In fact, it's completely the opposite ‚Äì it's something that you constantly need to be discussing openly and explaining to your clients and readers. It's your responsibility as an SEO professional to make sure that your clients understand exactly what you're doing and why you're doing it; only then can you both succeed in reaching your goals.\nContent plays a huge part in SEO, and it will continue to do so for quite some time to come.

This couldn't be further from the truth; in fact, most experts agree that doing content this way will actually hurt your rankings, rather than help them. You need to ensure that your content is actually interesting and engaging.\nYou need to understand that when it comes to content and SEO, the best results always come from having a clear strategy and a plan in place for exactly what you want to achieve with your content.\nThis is especially important if you're trying to use content to improve your social media marketing efforts; you need to have a clear plan and strategy in place before you start trying to execute it.\nThere's a common misconception among SEO professionals that if your backlink profile isn't absolutely perfect, you're doomed to failure.

The Democrats don‚Äôt deserve our support this time. They chose the lesser of two evils, but still chose evil. They got caught. I think the world looks at us as the land of the free and home of the brave but that doesn‚Äôt always ring true these days. I will vote for the Libertarian party because the rest have betrayed our trust and our honor.\nA big surprise on the other candidates who have quit to day\nBush drops out\nClinton drops out\nPaul drops out\nThat just leaves Trump and Cruz to go\nThat should be interesting as both would run the country very differently\nObamas approval rating is now below 50% as well as his two predecessors\nJimmy Carter and George Bush II\nThe only one with a high approval rating is Bill Clinton at 60% which is no suprise as he gave the nation three balanced budgets in a row\nMakes one wonder who should be responsible for the mess the country is in\nObama or the country‚Äôs prior presidents\nIts all very obvious to me\nIt‚Äôs obvious that Clinton was in control of the DNC. She picked her own replacement. And I‚Äôm not just a Bernie supporter. I‚Äôve never voted for a democrat in my life. Because they have too much special interest money. I also think that she should go to jail for being involved in the ‚ÄúLynching of America‚Äù. All the corrupt democrats in Congress should go to jail. Every one of them! They made the country a laughing stock. It‚Äôs disgusting. A disgrace.\nI wish the Bernie supporters would stop being negative about Hilary. I believe she was a great senator, a great friend, a great mother and a great grandmother and most of all a true loving, hard working American woman . It just sad that her opponent was allowed to tear down a lifetime career of a person and a family with no regard‚Ä¶‚Ä¶just because Trump believes he would make a better president‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs not about the money because he had plenty already. It‚Äôs about the people‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm all for Bernie but I can not give him my vote because it would mean voting for the opposite of everything Hilary stands for, which he can never come close to. I‚Äôd vote for Jill Stein because she too has been viciously attacked‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ by some of her own party‚Ä¶for standing for what she believes in and making a difference like Hilary has as well‚Ä¶She wants to clean up the mess the US has made in the global environment and the world has made and for all time. She advocates that Americans must work together for the good of our country, our leaders need to be fair democratic leaders that lead by example, not force and demand but with wisdom. This is a woman that has earned the respect and admiration from people all over the world.. She is a human being before she is anything else and she does not believe in judging others. When asked what the greatest accomplishment of her lifetime was, ‚Ä¶she did not say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the first woman to be president‚Äù‚Ä¶.she said ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI am the proud and loving mom of my three daughters‚Äù‚Ä¶her greatest joy in life. That is who Hilary is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..she was and always has been a loving mother who wants the same for every child. I‚Äôm sorry Bernie supporters but this woman is not for sale the way Trump is‚Ä¶She believes in true justice for all and has dedicated her life to that cause‚Ä¶..It is not a political goal she set to get voted into office‚Ä¶.it is her belief, her heart and soul to help the weak, poor and down trodden‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.She is and has always been a fighter for the rights of women, children, the mentally and physically ill, the poor and the disadvantaged and a true champion and advocate for the handicapped and the rights of the handicapped and the disabled and veterans‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. If you cannot see who Clinton truly is‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt tell you‚Ä¶you have"

Do you want to have a private ICO for your project? If so yes it is possible however if you want to sell these tokens in a secondary market I do not think this is possible. I have also not heard of a public presale. It would be possible to create a presale contract separate from the main contract, I would however recommend against that as the presale contract will then be under your control and might not be able to be published on a mainstream exchange such as etherdelta for example. Pegemist was originally developed for the DAO and was then implemented on the ERC20 standard in the Etheruem blockchain. What was originally thought was for the DAO was in the end used for controlling the voting system on the DAO and to create a simple ether balance system and it is the system that is used for most dapps on the Ethereum blockchain. I have not used or seen a presale contract that uses Pegemist so I do not really understand the advantages over creating a normal smart contract for the presale. I do not know if there are advantages with using Pegemist but generally I would not recommend using it unless you already have a good understanding of when and why it should be used and the advantages and disadvantages of it over other solutions such as using a set of standard smart contracts such as the ones found in the ERC20 standard, or using an off the shelf library such as the Mist smart contracts library. The presale contract is just another standard type of contract so it can use any of the standard blockchain contract languages, or it can use a standard smart contract such as the ERC20 standard or Mist library contracts.

You mentioned that I can build something with an API such as poloniex, or idex if I just want to have presale contract for private investors. But if I want it to be listed on a market after I got enough presale, how can I submit it for listing to a market like ethereum.delta or ethgas?\nFor listing on DApps such as the DAO or Etherdelta it would be possible using ETH smart contracts, however it would be difficult because most of these dapps only give access to the front end interface such as the DAO or EtherDelta dapps and not to the actual smart contracts running the dapp which would be the presale contract.

[inaudible] 180 times per second, it will take just one seconds for you to rotate 180 degrees.\nso that's actually the recommended pattern, but most people will just use a transform component or they'll use -- for just one axis, they'll use animation or just a single animation component.\n>> so how do i make the game move in a particular direction.\n>> depends on the game, but most of the time you can just say up or down -- up or down just to determine -- if you want your player to move up, you would be like up or down, and it would rotate up, so it is in the X -- the player is facing [inaudible] like that. the player is facing like this, and then you would say up just to look up. and it will look to the direction so it's facing up and then it can move up to wherever it needs to go. up, down, left, right -- yeah that's just it.\n>> so once i set the transform and i want the game to move in specific direction how do i do that. do i use a velocity value if i want to change the direction?\n>> if you said up here, if you say left or right, that means it's already facing another direction. instead of just rotating, you might want to use a velocity component or maybe a force component, like a wind direction or something, but the animation component is all about movement, not about the force.\n>> so it might be good for the game to have both, so if you were doing collision, would it be a good idea to add the velocity component to the object to know how far it needs to go or would it be a good idea to add the velocity component to the transform so that then i have something i can just check to see if the direction that i want has changed and then adjust my value if its going too fast or too slow?\n>> it depends on how you implement your collision. usually you would define the collisions and the collision events, and then that happens, like hit the wall or whatever it might be, and then you would say if, for example, I hit a wall, do this, do that, and then you can actually do the collision logic yourself, just like you could have a collision component, or it'd be like a hit collision component thing, which would have just the collision parameters, but you can have it -- the hit collision component would just receive the information from the actual hit collision, and then you can make the decision on your own what to do.\ndo that collision between the two objects, but if you're doing it yourself, it is -- usually it is preferable to just have it as an own event, the collision, and then check the velocity as a value from the collision event, because for some reason it's faster. and it's the same thing, just use the collision event -- the collision event is a message which goes through the entire scene and then if it collides in a certain place, then you just check if there was a collision and that can result in quite a performance gain.\nit's still faster to do it that way, rather than just"

Even diet soda - research showed that it leads to obesity and increased risks for diabetes. Cut out alcohol as well for both sugar and alcohol reasons. Cut out processed foods/bread/candy/etc and go with fresh meat, veggies, and fruits (and plenty of water). Drink plenty of water - especially when working out. Coffee is ok in moderation, but don't depend on it. And the key to all this is exercise!\nAlso, as for meals, try cutting out the carbs as much as possible, but have more meat/nuts/vegetables. Do keep a protein with every meal, but try to keep the fat content as low or moderate as possible. And eat often, but don't snack on junk foods or you will just put back on the weight you lost."

How many years will the eclipse last? Find the sum of the distances over 20 years. Does this vary depending on the location of the eclipse? In the UK, 29th July is typically the hottest day of the year. However, in the US, 29th August typically has the highest temperature. Is the pattern the same for other countries? Which countries have the highest or lowest temperatures in August? Find average temperatures for several different countries for a month. What factors contribute to the difference in temperatures between different countries? The temperature decreases as you travel north. Find a formula for calculating temperature that works for the UK and that is valid for all the regions you wish to investigate (e.g. Scotland, England). Work out the difference in temperature between the UK and Spain as an example. How does the pattern vary around the world? Write a formula that you could use to calculate temperature of any location as long as you know average rainfall and distance from equator. How would you determine average rainfall at a different location? Use your formula with a data file containing information on temperatures around different latitudes. How accurate are your predictions? You can read this data file with spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel). To use this formula it would be really helpful if you could calculate average rainfall with a similar formula. How to do this: Consider all the rainfall at locations in your data file and divide by the number of observations. You can also apply your formula for temperature by considering all the temperatures in your data file and dividing by the number of observations. Work out the formula for average rainfall for all locations and use the values from a data file as an example. Is there a difference in the pattern of rainfall between different locations? In the Northern Hemisphere there are usually more clouds than in the Southern Hemisphere. Write a formula that relates the number of times a day a site is cloudy to temperature, rain and other weather factors (e.g. wind speed). What factors might affect if a location is more cloudy than other locations? Find this pattern for each month of the year and other factors that might affect the pattern (e.g. distance from the equator). What factors affect whether it rains in the winter or summer in a location? How does this pattern vary around the world? For what seasons does it usually rain? Find this pattern for each month of the year and other factors that might affect the pattern. For what seasons does it usually rain? You can use your own data sets of temperature, cloud cover and rain to explore these patterns. Are there differences between different countries? It is usually coldest during winter and hottest during summer. Write a formula for the average temperature for different times of the year. How does this pattern vary around the world? For what seasons is it coldest in each country? Is this difference in winter temperatures the same in all countries? Work out the average temperature in each season for different countries and explain how these differences vary (or not) around the world. Which seasons have the highest average temperatures? Which are the coldest seasons? You can use your own data sets or data from the National Weather Service. You can use these data to investigate the pattern of temperature for different seasons. Explore how this pattern varies between countries. Which countries have the warmest summer? The coldest winter? What about other countries that you are comparing? Working with Data You can use the data in Table 2 of this document or the data in this spreadsheet that you downloaded on February 2015 and use a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel). Look at how rainfall and temperature vary by location in Great Britain. Explore how this compares to Australia or your own country. You can enter this data using the spreadsheet that you downloaded on February 2015, or you can use your own data files. To use the files above you need to know how to use a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel) to enter in a data table, save the table and then print the table. If you are using your own data files then you will need to know how to enter each value in a new column as you add additional entries. You can use your work on temperature to analyse more weather variables such as wind speed or air pressure. You can explore the temperature and rainfall data for your country and make predictions of the weather over the next week. Write a formula that tells you how many degrees of temperature apart two locations in your country are. Write another formula that tells you how far apart two locations in your country are.

Can you please help? Thanks a lot! And happy holidays.\nHi, Thanks a lot! The same applies when doing a request. Would you be so kind as to provide some information on the dashboard you would like me to help you with? Thanks!\nHi @pavelhru, Thanks for getting back to me. I'd like you to look at the competitors dashboards as shown below: In the first one, the sales people could use the information in the panel at the bottom to help them prioritize their activities, by looking for deals with the highest percentage of revenue from their accounts and those with the lowest percentage. However, these are for large and medium companies respectively. I would like to design a dashboard with comparable metrics, but for small companies. In the second dashboard, it shows the total revenue from all of the accounts, but there is no information on how many opportunities there are for each account, or what the most recently closed deal was for each account. I would like to incorporate a metric for that. Also, there's no information on the % revenue from each account. Lastly, to show more information/better comparability between the two companies, the same kind of statistics should be available for the revenue and the % revenue by deal and customer. I found some good reference material for some of this, like this, this, this, and this. This post is already long enough, so I won't write more here. Please let me know if you're interested in answering my query, or if you would like me to provide the dashboard mocks (they are attached below). Regards, PS. Please feel free to not reply to this post if you aren't interested in helping me with this. I understand that you are a very busy guy, and will certainly help someone else with his/her queries. I just wanted to be sure. Thanks!\nHi @pavelhru, Thanks a lot for sharing the reference material for the dashboard. Regarding the dashboard you have attached, I did look into it; but it was for a SaaS company, which is a completely different situation than a small or medium company. I am interested in helping you with your query - I just wanted to be sure since I have plenty of projects running this week. Would you please have a look at the competitors dashboards too and let me know if you have any questions? Cheers, PS. Also, I would like this to be a new question/thread, not an extension of this one. I would like to create a new thread with the link to this one, if that's ok with you. Thanks.\nHi @pavelhru, Yes, I was referring to the two dashboards below. I would like to create a dashboard similar to them, but for a different kind of customer, i.e. not for an SaaS company but a small/medium customer, so the metrics would be different on the panel at the bottom and the metric for the top section to determine the priority for the sales people to focus on would be different too (e.g. 5% revenue vs % account revenue). I found some good reference material, but still wanted to check whether you think this is possible? If so, can you give me some pointers on how you would go about doing this? Thanks.\nYes, and no. It is not possible to create a custom dashboard for small/ medium accounts the same way it is for large accounts. The data would not be there. You would need to change the size of the customer to smaller and this is a different type of customer altogether."

Doesn't this infringe on government interfering with private corporations?<br>\nIsn't it time we stop making decisions by voting and instead make decisions with common sense and good judgement? This kind of vote and decision making in government is what cause the great depression!<br>\nI agree, the govt shouldn't be in the business of deciding on pipelines. If they decide that the pipeline is in the public interest, then they should be compensating the land owners. <br>\nWhen will this end???<br><br>\nI agree but then again we have a government running our country. Why couldn't they just make an agreement with land owners or at least meet in the middle. The oil producers pay for it and the government just takes their cut. Isn't it always us when we get taxed on every purchase we make?<br><br>\nI know I'm repeating myself, but that's the problem with our government. The system is setup to create more and bigger problems then the ones we're trying to solve. <br>\nIt's the American way. Government is out to extract money from you, in the name of \"fairness\". The problem is that those in power make the laws to their benefit, and then use government to enforce them. They're not the solution, they're the problem. <br>\nHuge pipelines (the size of small railroads) are a major engineering feat. They have to be in pristine condition at all times so any \"accident\" will not affect the environment.\nThe biggest problem I have is that they don't take into account the fact that these pipelines \"burst\" in the process and that the leaking and spilling of oil is not an accident but rather an occurrence that is sure to happen.\nThey should at least be honest about it and stop the rhetoric about how \"safe\" they are.<br>\nThere were several accidents last year alone. None were major, but the fact remains that this type of pipeline has a history of problems.<br>\nThe problem is the lack of regulation as well as the relentless pressure some politicians exert on regulators.<br>\nI would like to see the proposed Keystone Pipeline route modified considerably. There has to be alternatives because this pipeline will create a permanent source of environmental damage which will be a disaster for agriculture and ranching. We have had enough major environmental disasters in our state and region.<br><br>\nThis project will have an extremely negative effect on the environment as well as people and wildlife. Not a single reputable scientific organization has come out in support of this project or its proposed route.\nTo build this pipeline they would not be able to avoid some of the most significant wildlife habitat in the U.S.<br><br>\nIf it kills one bird it is too many and we should not allow it."

It is a very efficient and effective technique that is widely used in the cloud infrastructure. It helps in reducing the costs as well as hardware resources required for maintaining the cloud infrastructure. It has a wide range of applications on private and public cloud service infrastructures. It is used to launch virtual machine instances easily on the cloud infrastructure. The hardware virtualization technique generates virtual hardware units on the physical hardware devices to simulate dedicated resources that are available physically to a cloud provider. In this way, we can launch many virtual machines on the computing hardware devices easily, while we are using only one physical hardware unit.\nIt is a very important type of cloud virtualization technology and it is widely used for launching, operating, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. It plays a vital role in developing and supporting different cloud applications and platforms in different cloud providers.\nIt can be used to create different virtual hardware instances for launching different virtual machines physically on the computing hardware devices. This is a very efficient and powerful technique that helps in simplifying the hardware infrastructure and it saves the costs of hardware acquisition and maintenance. This feature of hypervisor plays a vital role in simplifying the hardware implementation on cloud services.\nHardware virtualization is widely used in public and private cloud services to develop, maintain, and support different types of application, platforms, and services on the cloud infrastructure. It can be used to create different types of cloud services and applications supported by different cloud services, virtualization technologies, and hypervisor modules. This type of cloud virtualization is widely used in managing dedicated and shared server hosting on the cloud infrastructure.\nHypervisor modules directly communicate with the computing hardware to generate virtual hardware instances. This feature of hypervisor enables the physical hardware devices to share the resources between a number of different tenants. It is widely used in private and public cloud services for managing shared server hosting environment based on hypervisor software. It allows us to share resources of a physical server among a number of different tenants to create a dedicated, virtualized infrastructure. Hardware virtualization is used to manage different types of cloud services and applications by allocating resources of cloud infrastructure. It helps us to provide shared, dedicated resources to the tenants on a shared cloud infrastructure.\nBy deploying virtual hardware units on the computing infrastructure, we can improve the use efficiency of hardware infrastructure. By deploying different guest instances on the cloud hardware, we can share resources among a number of different tenants. These tenants can use that shared hardware infrastructure to launch different cloud applications and services supported by cloud services.\nIt is a powerful and efficient technique of virtualizing the hardware devices on cloud infrastructure. It enables us to create a number of different virtual hardware instances for launching different guest instances on the cloud hardware.

Show the math (you can do this on PE, but i think they expect more detail so i'm posting here) for anyone who's interested. Show your work and explain it. In doing so you should be able to show how your assumptions (ie, the Drake equation) influence the results.\nThe Drake equation also asks about the number of societies which go extinct without ever becoming interstellar travelers ‚Äì one, probably. You could throw that in as a zero, unless there is something of value in that assumption. You can also throw in the number of societies which become extinct without reaching a technological level where interstellar travel becomes a possibility. You could give that a negative number, as well. In general, you should estimate and calculate the probability distribution (probability density function) of several parameters and their resulting distributions. I have not done this calculation myself, but i have read a lot about it and i think it‚Äôs worth doing. You can post your results on POE as well if you like.\nI think you'll have to do some homework, I mean, I do not know your level of study or schooling, so you have to work hard and think so that you can have better responses.\nIt will be interesting to see how you answer the questions, of course assuming that you do so seriously. You can always post or upload your work if you want. Perhaps you can post the solutions here or on PE.\ni thought the term interstellar flight should be avoided because there is no evidence at all that a starship is feasible, in theory it has been speculated that some other star could exist which does not have a starship (just like Earth). So the proper term would be \"interstellar travel\".\nIn other words, the interstellar flight term confuses the issue because it implies that it's just a matter of making a starship. The problem is the distance between the stars (so much that is not feasible at the present time because of engineering, physics, biology, mathematics, and economics).\ni disagree, interstellar flight does not mean starship, interstellar flight could be, in this context, human exploration (in the future, if humans are to colonize) in other stellar worlds. This is part of the debate, this debate should be about our possibilities in travelling in our galaxy, not in another galaxy, so interstellar flight should be justifiable. Also, your explanation about distance is incorrect, there is a possibility for interstellar flight, and in my opinion, the only way that we could colonize other stellar world is by interstellar travel, not intergalactic (which is too far for us).\ni think that you have to give up a little, and try to be objective and realistic about the potential that may exist in the future, interstellar flight could just be a possibility, and we do not know, until we make starships, because if we could make one in the future, then we can do interstellar flight.\nWell, I think we need to be realistic. Let's say that we build a starship 100 years from now (unlikely) and that we send it to Alpha Centauri, the fastest human mission, probably. The starship travels at 10% of the speed of light which is 45,000 times faster than the speed of light, the distance is about 15,000 light-years. I believe that we can calculate it easily from there. So, after that, 15,000 years will have gone by since the starship left. For that time, there are all sorts of events that probably will happen in our solar system: comets smashing into planets, and so on. If a spaceship is designed well enough to keep the crew alive, then there is no indication at all that it cannot keep its equipment and data working. But I suspect that after that time, human space technology will have moved on, and that the equipment and technology of the starship will be obsolete, and that it will not be possible to get it back home. So ultimately, we have wasted 15,000 years of our civilization's potential. I think it's better to spend resources on our own planet and not on such a longshot, that has very low probability of succeeding, in my opinion.\nI also did not like that they called humans \"spacefarers\" and not \"interstellar travelers.\" Space can be far, but just because there is a large distance between stars doesn"

        "output": "what are african governments doing to improve air traffic connectivity in their respective countries air traffic connectivity is key to increasing intra-africa tourism and air traffic connectivity across the africa continent could lead to easier access to countries which has significant potential on the various african tourism products for example southern africa has various natural tourism products such as eco-tourism and safaris and these could be improved if the road and rail infrastructure leading into southern africa was improved as well as air connectivity to the region as well as the southern african governments have taken a number of steps to improve air traffic connectivity for example south africas government has announced plans to build a new airport in the western cape province which could become a hub for domestic flights throughout africa as well as a hub for air traffic connectivity to south america once the airports construction is completed on top of the new airport the government would also have upgrade the road infrastructure leading to the airport as well as various rail links to make transport to and from the area easy not only will this make transport to and from the airport easier it would also make africa more connected from the western african region across to south america and also east africa into south america a number of other african governments have also taken steps to increase air traffic connectivity from the european union from east africa to africa there has been increase in number airlines with ehta with its alliance partners from eastern africa such as kenya and tanzania to west african countries such as nigeria this air connectivity has been key in attracting more tourists as well as the increased air connectivity from northeast africa to africa such as morocco to the ethiopia government has announced planned investments to improve air traffic connectvity between ethiopia and its north african neighbours such as egypt and morocco however while all these steps are being taken some countries such as ghana and cote d ivoire and liberia have not yet taken steps to improve african air traffic connectivity due to factors such as inadequate road infrastructure or airlines the government has lacked political will to improve the situation in several african states many african states have been plagued by political instability over the years and government efforts to improve air traffic connectivity may have been derailed due to political unrest in the country governments such as the ghanian government have taken steps to improve air traffic connectivity however for these plans to be a success the implementation of these plans is what will be important to the longterm success of african air travel for example the recently completed and opened the second terminal at the ghana airports which is the first phase of an expansion project which is aimed towards improving air traffic connectivity in ghana however the completion of phase one will only be a short term gain as the second terminal will only increase the capacity of the airport by 300000 passengers in a year if the government takes the step to implement its planned expansion projects it could lead to increased tourism arrivals from the european union to africa as well as increase the number of tourists which could come to africa from the arab and middle east region due to the increased air connectivity from the middle east region to africa a number of other measures could be taken to improve air traffic connectivity not only at the national government levels but also on the state government levels for example increasing air traffic connectivity is not an easy task and the governments of a number of airports and airports and state government authorities across africa which operate airports such as the kenyan authority which is responsible for the construction and expansion of the kenya airports authority have taken various steps to improve air traffic connectivity such as building and operating several new airports in areas such as the eastern part of the country however such moves require state and national government level support due to factors such as the funding it requires to build and operate the new and expanded airports across the country so what is the solution to improve african air traffic connectivity so what is the solution to improve african air traffic connectivity and attract more tourists to africa it could be at the national and state government level for certain countries however what it is important to realise is the fact that for many african states and cities it is not so much about lack of facilities or infrastructure such as roads or railways which is the key challenge for improving air traffic connectivity in africa rather it is the fact that for many airport authorities it is the lack of funding to carry out infrastructure and air traffic connectivity enhancement projects is a real challenge however what could be key is for the government to put plans in place to implement initiatives to which would help

        "output": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment? In a more general sense, by examining their relationship to Kahane in more complex terms, I was able to better contextualize the ways in which a Jewish American establishment often works to suppress and control their Jewish constituents, and therefore better understand Kahane's work and motivations as an ethnically driven racial exclusionist who attempted to challenge this establishment in order to empower the less privileged and marginalized in the American Jewish community. This was particularly beneficial in terms of writing this thesis in as a whole, as it gave me the opportunity to more fully and truly grapple with the complexities of my own subject matter, and subsequently sharpen the focus, clarity, and sophistication of my arguments and thesis itself. In short, then, by examining the relationship between the American Jewish establishment and Kahane specifically in order to understand his relationship to Zizek and Fanon in more general, I ultimately achieved a greater clarity, sophistication, and depth regarding my subject in a more general sense. I was able to understand Kahane as an intellectual, political, social and cultural expression of the contradictory and unresolved issues within and within the American Jewish Establishment, and as such was able to develop a more precise and insightful understanding of the complex and often contradictory issues the two groups faced, as well as the ways in which one was attempting to challenge the other in order to address those issues, and ultimately the ways in which each respective group sought to define itself amidst the challenge of the other. Doing so, in turn, enabled me to develop a clearer, more profound, and more sophisticated understanding of Kahane per se, especially in terms of the complexity and nuances of his beliefs regarding Jewish identity and Judaism, Jewish community, state, and religion, and the relationship amongst these. I understand Kahane to be an intriguing, controversial, and often misunderstood \"outlier\" within the American Jewish community who saw many problems, both internal and external, within the American Jewish establishment which he believed must be addressed if the community as a whole was to progress in a manner which he believed would more fully and authentically embody their religious tradition and practice. As such, by better understanding the historical context, social dynamics, and intellectual developments within which this outlook was formulated, and in which Kahane sought to address the issues which he viewed to be a pressing concern for the American Jewish community as a whole, I was better able to develop a deeper, more nuanced, and perhaps more critical understanding of Kahane's worldview. This, in turn, enabled me to better understand him as both a person and as a public intellectual, as well as to assess and reevaluate, if needed, the historical and contemporary significance and meaning of his work and ideas. As such, not only does understanding Kahane's ethics of violence in relationship to Zizek and Fanon provide greater context and insights for to my own subject matter within this thesis and its more general theoretical and academic context, it also gives me a broader framework from which to more fully comprehend and understand Kahane as an intellectual and cultural and political figure within the context of contemporary American Judaism and the American Jewish community. Kahane was an outstanding public intellectual who often contributed to public debates regarding many crucial issues facing contemporary American Jews, and I believe that a better understanding of Kahane's ethics of violence, specifically in relation to Zizek and Fanon, could provide greater context for and deeper insight into these debates. Moreover, by examining this contextual relationship, I was better able to more fully comprehend, critique, and evaluate the merits and shortcomings associated with the different approaches and perspectives offered to contemporary Jewish American dilemmas surrounding matters such as Jewish identity and collective memory, Jewish community and culture, and Jewish continuity and authenticity, and to further consider how these approaches and perspectives may be utilized and integrated in a manner which would be best suited to address these concerns and issues. In an academic sense, then, I believe that a deeper and more nuanced understanding and appreciation of Kahane's ethos of violence in connection with Zizek and Fanon would help illuminate the historical context and intellectual development of contemporary Jewish American public intellectual debates and discussions on matters of ethnicity, religious tradition, religious identity, collective memory, and communal practice, enabling me a potentially more enlightened and critical perspective on these issues and debates as they are currently understood, as well as the intellectual capacities needed to develop a more progressive and"

        "instruction": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing",
        "output": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing, it's a JavaScript dialect, for use with TypeScript to get access to full TypeScript's power, it extends JavaScript's syntax in places, but you really don't lose anything.\nThe biggest gain of TypeScript is that you can write type-safe code with the help of Intellisense and type checking, but you can easily fall into the trap of assuming if it's TypeScript it must be type-safe (it also supports non-TypeScript code, but that will fail at compile time).\nTo help avoid the trap of thinking TypeScript code is always safe, TSC has a type hinting system to indicate variables or functions are of a specific type, which is usually string, number, boolean, or an interface or object, e.g.\nvar number: number = 10; //this is safe because it's a number\nvar boolean: boolean = false; //safe\nvar something = \"hello world\"; //this is safe because of the type hint string\nvar interface: IInterface = { }; //also safe because TypeScript will check the interface is a proper type to use\nThis will allow TypeScript to detect any issues that arise where a certain type is expected or passed where it's incorrect, if you give type a value of an incorrect type, it will fail to compile, e.g.\nnumber: string = 5; //this is an error because number can't be converted to string\ninterface: Object = \"hello world\"; //an error because IInterface is not a valid type\nThis means that TypeScript will help you avoid writing any unsafe/incorrect code which runs fine in JavaScript, but will fail or run badly in production. For example, this code will work fine in JavaScript in the browser, but will fail if you try to run it locally or in the server.\nif (foo == \"bar\") { //this works fine in JavaScript and returns true\nconsole.log(\"OK!\");\ndoSomething(); //this will fail and will throw an error\nNow, with type hinting, this will fail at compile time, meaning you won't actually write any unsafe or incompatible code and will be able to immediately detect any issues:\nif (foo.toLowerCase() == \"bar\") { //this will fail due to not using a type hint for lower case comparison\nconsole.log(\"Not OK!\");\nso now you can detect any errors before they even run.\nI should stress that there are still ways to make TypeScript code unsafe, but it's now easier to spot. For example, JavaScript has no guarantee for type safety because it's a loosely-typed language and has features like \"duck typing\", which allows any data type to be passed for any function, e.g.\n//OK as the numbers can be compared\naddBankAccounts([42, false]); //will fail as the second argument is incorrect\n//This will fail because numbers aren't strings\naddAccountName(42, \"foo\"); //will fail as 42 is a number\nNote how it's possible to write unsafe code because of TypeScript's type inferencing - it'll infer any type correctly which means you can write code based on a type that can work correctly. This is true for JavaScript as well, as it will determine the correct type based on the data you pass in. However, with the use of TypeScript you can now spot any unsafe code much easier.\nA common example of unsafe code is \"spread operators\" - the syntax { ... } which lets you pass in an object, but will only work with objects, e.g.\n//This will fail as the spread operator is only for objects\naddAccountName({id: 5}); //This will throw errors because the spread operator only works on objects, not numbers\nAnother example is where people assume an enum or an interface can be used - for example they pass enum or interface.id if the data has an ID associated with it. This can work with some types, but it will fail if the type is incorrect with a type checker in TypeScript, e.g.\nvar id = 5;\nvar user: userId = {id: 5}\n//This will fail with a type checking error because 5 is not equal to number\n//This is correct because 5 is an integer\n//This is also correct because 5 is an integer\n//This will fail because 5 is not equal to a string\n//This is also acceptable as it's valid for the object to have the ID from the interface\n//This would also fail as 5 is not equal to a string\n//This would still be correct as a string is not a valid type for userId\n//This is also correct as 5 is an integer; this"

In that carbon fiber is wrapped around a special kind of epoxy resin and that epoxy resin gives the carbon fiber a lot of strength and durability when it's part of some composite material right they're very resistant to high temperature and also resistant to environmental conditions. So again that is a composite material that is specifically designed for structural applications in buildings and then as the carbon fiber as a standalone material in composites is also available a few people might be using that but more popular composite material that is designed for structural applications in buildings.

Social Challenges\n- Improving women's role in rural development\n- Building human capital\n- Improving access to health, education and other\n- Increasing environmental protection\nIn this chapter, Jean-Claude, Dev√®ze outlined the key challenges for\nAfrican agriculture, including economic challenges, political challenges,\nand sociocultural challenges.\nWith regard to the economic challenges, Dev√®ze argued that since the\ncrisis of the 1970s, the economies of many African countries have become\nstronger due to their expanding agricultural development. The agricultural\nsector plays a crucial role in supplying food, creating income, and providing\nemployment in the rural areas. For example, the demand for food in sub-\nSaharan Africa is increasing due to the increased urban population. In\naddition, the increasing world price of industrial products has also led to\na growing demand for agricultural products such as crops and animal\nMeanwhile, the export market for agricultural products has created\nopportunities for rural producers. For example, the introduction of the\nEPA agreement has led to greater market access to the EU markets for\nAfrica's agricultural exports. However, Dev√®ze also argued that some\ncountries are suffering from the 'Dutch disease', whereby the excessive\nrevenue from agricultural exports threatens to damage the non-agricultural\nThe increasing demand for agricultural products has also increased\nthe pressure on agricultural land resources. In addition, there are also\nenvironmental impacts associated with agriculture such as soil erosion,\nwater pollution, and land degradation. These issues should be addressed\nin order to conserve Africa's natural resources and to improve agricultural\nDev√®ze highlighted that due to the increasing economic power of the\nrural population, the agricultural sector needs to be modernised to\nincrease productivity, improve quality, and benefit producers, especially\nsmallholders with limited land and technology. For example, there is still\na great diversity in technology usage among African countries, thus\nthere is still a need to encourage more countries to adopt precision\nagriculture and precision irrigation. In addition, there is a need for\ninvestment in rural infrastructure, such as water, roads, and energy, to\nimprove access to markets and to promote economic development in the\nrural areas.\nWith regard to the political challenges, Dev√®ze argued that\ndecentralisation of agricultural development is necessary in order to\nincrease efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural markets. There is\na need for the implementation of innovative policies for the local\ncommunities by establishing effective public-private partnerships.\nIn addition, there is a need to provide rural producers with access to\ncredit from financial institutions or banks, and to improve marketing\nIn this chapter, Dev√®ze focused on four social challenges in African\nagriculture: improving the role of women, building human capital, improving\naccess to health, education, and other social services, and improving\nenvironment protection. In terms of women's role, women make up a\nmajority of the rural workforce but still face discrimination in\nagricultural development. Thus, it is important to ensure women's\nparticipation in agricultural policies and projects, in order to empower\nwomen, so that they can be more economically active. In addition, there\nis a need to improve the capacity building of women through training,\neducation, and information in order to empower them and help them\nmake decisions that enhance their agricultural production activities.

        "instruction": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?",
        "output": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature? Why are these wavelengths different from one metal to the next?\nMetals in the Sun and other stars emit light of a particular color corresponding to the color of that metal in the visible range of visible light. The color of the light emitted by metals as the Sun or other stars get increasingly hot is dependent on what wavelengths and frequencies of light they emit. This is not a straight simple relationship! As the temperature of a metal increases, more electrons get promoted to higher energy states. These energy levels correspond to particular colors. The lower the metals, the more electrons occupy the ground state and emit light of low energy and longer wavelength. As the temperature of the metals increases, more and more electrons get promoted to higher energy states. As shown in Figure 8, the absorption spectrum of a metal shifts toward higher frequencies as the temperature increases because more and more electrons in a certain energy level are promoted to higher energy levels. Each time electrons get promoted to a higher energy level, they emit a photon with the energy corresponding to the energy difference between the energy levels. This corresponds to a particular wavelength or frequency of light. These wavelengths are called emission or forbidden wavelengths and are usually shorter wavelengths than the wavelengths that are absorbed. These emission wavelengths of light that are emitted by the electrons in the metal are what give the metal a unique visible color. Figure illustrates the relation between the temperature and the color of metals.\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, scientists tried to explain the colors of various metals based on colors of the sunlight that reflected the metals. While the colors of metals can depend on the sunlight that reflects them, their spectra is often different. For example, the spectra of some metals reflect the sunlight in only one color and not the others, even though the reflected sunlight has all its colors blended together. Also, their absorption spectra look different under visible light and under ultraviolet light [link to absorption and emission spectra of metals]. These differences provided evidence that these colors have a physical origin and are not only a reflection of sunlight that reflects as different colors on the metal.\nMetals at High Temperature Emit Different Colors\nBased on absorption and emission spectra, it is possible to distinguish how metals in different temperatures emit light, i.e. absorption and/or emission spectra can be used to classify metals. For example, all of the elements in the third column have their wavelengths of color in the visible spectrum. Each of these colors have a corresponding frequency. But each of these colors look different from another! There is no way to tell by looking at the color of the metal if it was made of platinum or lead. Only by looking at the spectrum of emitted color reveals the element. If we see that they have common emission wavelengths in the spectrum, we know that they must be the same element, even if they may look different colors. Since every metal in the periodic table has a characteristic emssion spectrum, the emission spectra can be used to determine what element the metal is. Similarly, if we see that the absorption peak of the metal lies in the region of ultraviolet light, we know that the element must be an element in that period (column) since only elements in that period have absorption peaks in this region. Since they are not in the visible spectrum, we are not able to tell what elements are, just based on their color under visible light.\nEmission spectra of all elements are unique to each element and different from those of other elements. We can use these spectra to identify what element is represented in a metal. The absorption spectra are also unique to each element but are rarely important for identifying elements since each element has its characteristic emission spectrum. For example, we may look at the color and not know if it is made up of iron and platinum. We probably will not know the exact composition just from looking at the color. But if we look at the emission or absorption spectrum, we would know the exact composition of the metal.\nFigure: Emission spectra of the elements in groups I to VI.\nThere are many different techniques that are used to identify elements in different samples. Most of these techniques focus on understanding the wavelength range of light that an element emits as it gets increasingly hot and on understanding the physical mechanism how these wavelengths change with the temperature. We will focus on how these techniques help us understand the role of electrons in metals and how different elements emit light at different temperatures.\nWe can classify all"

It is no secret that both presidents Trump and Putin have both come to an understanding and both are working for same cause. If you are looking for someone to blame, then you can try to blame the media as you are doing as you seem to have a very good grasp of the current media situation going on.\nAs you may have just noticed, the media seems to be a bit more focused on this subject. It is not because the media is trying to pit America against Russia ‚Äì it is because it is making headlines worldwide and the media like covering things that make headlines worldwide.\nWhy do you even care? I am telling you the reality and you are not even aware of it and you will even question my facts? This is why everything is going wrong.\nI am not a Putin stooge and I am not a Trump stooge. I am neither. I am telling you from the eyes of a layperson, observer and not a commentator.\nMy question is ‚Äì why in the world would Putin and his intelligence agents working with MI6 and FSB and other agencies and no one can say which agency is working harder to save their country work against their own country and let the US be a global power?\nAgainst their own country? Do you even understand what you just said?\nYou said it yourself. You are ‚Äúworking as a layperson, observer‚Äù and are not a Trump stooge.\nYou are saying that Trump is not working for selfish reasons and that it is not in his own best interest, but rather in the interest of the country as a whole.\nTrump is working for his own interest and Russia, in the guise of Putin, is working for its own interest, and those interests are not necessarily going to be aligned.\nLet me give you another example ‚Äì say you are the CEO at your company, if in the next 1-2 years the company does not make profits, you can be sure you will be fired as the CEO.\nBut let‚Äôs say the company made a lot of money in the last 10 years? Then I am sure the company will not fire you at all and you can probably get a promotion as the CEO.\nSounds quite logical right?\nIf Russia is still making money, then why would Putin want to mess up the relations with Trump or do things that will benefit the country a lot more?\nAnd as usual, you bring up another example that has nothing to do with what I had just said. You talk about the profits and the company and whatnot, and I say nothing about that. You also completely miss my point and I will quote you as you said ‚ÄúYou are saying that Trump is not working for selfish reasons and that it is not in his own best interest, but rather in the interest of the country as a whole.‚Äù So I ask you again why in the world would Putin work against his own country and let the US be a global power? You say the company makes money, so why would you try to destroy and ruin the company? There is nothing you can get from it. Putin should see it that way and that Russia‚Äôs interests should not always be aligned with US interests. That could be an interesting debate and I think I might post it to another forum if no one posts it here.\nNow you quote me as saying this, which is again not true ‚Äì ‚ÄúTrump is working for his own interest and Russia, in the guise of Putin, is working for its own interest, and those interests are not necessarily going to be aligned.‚Äù\nI did not say Trump was working for his own interest ‚Äì I said Trump is doing things for the good of the country as a whole, not for his own benefit or interest. There‚Äôs a huge difference in the two. Putin is also doing things for the country as a whole, again not in his own interest. He is doing the things he is doing because Putin is a leader."

        "output": "write a chronology of important events related to ESG in 2022?\nThe year 2022 marks a change in the environment that shifts investment patterns towards a greener approach, with sustainability becoming mainstream. As the global population steadily rises from 7.3 billion to 8 billion (an estimated average of 23 million birth per year), governments and corporations begin to take sustainability concerns more seriously.\nThis year, sustainable investment becomes mainstream ‚Äì at least half of global assets, led by a surge in ETFs, are allocated to sustainable investments. As the global population continues to increase, the world begins to pay more attention to sustainability and environment concerns.\nWith a greater focus on the environment, investors become even more aware of the impact that asset managers have on the environment. More rigorous reporting of energy emissions and carbon footprint become the norm, and ESG managers step up to the challenge to provide more relevant and detailed information to investors.\nGovernments also respond to the growing demand for more sustainable financial products and markets and provide incentives and regulations that encourage ESG investments in various sectors. As the financial landscape becomes increasingly driven by ESG, financial markets and products become more sustainable and responsible, making it even easier to invest in more sustainable sectors.\nA new report by BlackRock, ‚ÄúSustainable Global Shares 2018 Review: Building A Long-Term Investment Case‚Äù, suggests that there are at least two long-term reasons for ESG investing. ‚ÄúThe first is that investment case makes good business sense, from addressing operational risk to realising a better financial performance. The second is that it can help investors align with broader societal trends,‚Äù says Peter Haskell, BlackRock‚Äôs global head of sustainable investing.\n‚ÄúGrowth in the market will depend on asset managers getting better at communicating investment logic and financial performance in a clear and consistent way, and in the process educate investors and financial professionals on the benefits of investing sustainably.‚Äù\nBlackRock‚Äôs review notes a positive correlation between sustainable strategies and ESG-focused companies in several industries, suggesting that sustainability and profits are no longer mutually exclusive for companies. ‚ÄúIncreased investor interest is encouraging businesses to develop more sustainable business models,‚Äù adds Haskell.\nAlongside increased investor interest, environmental concerns have made their mark across industries and sectors. In recent years, many businesses and governments around the world have made it a priority to develop more sustainable business practices. These efforts are reflected in increasingly stringent regulations aimed at reducing negative environmental impacts. Some of these are regulatory requirements, while others are voluntary measures introduced by industry associations and companies that encourage better practices among their peers.\nMeanwhile, environmental concerns have become more prevalent in social and government agendas. The increasing awareness of environmental issues has driven more governments and industry leaders to develop policies and regulations that address sustainability concerns, including renewables, clean energy and resource conservation. This also creates an encouraging environment for ESG investment growth.\nAt the same time, the general public continues to place greater emphasis on environmental sustainability, with investment managers and policymakers responding accordingly. This has fuelled global demand for ESG and sustainable investments.\nTo put the growth of sustainable investments into perspective, the total value of environmental and sustainability mutual funds in the US has nearly tripled to more than US $21 billion, while European ETFs with an SRI focus have more than quadrupled to more than ‚Ç¨63 billion, according to industry data cited by BlackRock.\nA similar trend is reflected in Asia-Pacific countries, where the total number of environmental-themed mutual funds has more than doubled to about 3,865, worth more than US $64.5 billion, according to Morningstar.\nOn the regulatory front, governments and financial regulators worldwide have adopted various measures to promote sustainability and encourage investors to adopt more responsible investment practices. For instance, in 2017, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established a taskforce on ‚ÄúSustainable Finance‚Äù to improve financial policies, practices and instruments to achieve sustainable development. The taskforce developed a set of seven voluntary recommendations for financial policymakers and supervisors to help strengthen the financial system and make it more resil"

        "output": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence? Philosophers have argued both ways, so we need an independent standard. If there is a divine being who has made himself evident through both nature and historical revelation, then we should listen to what He says, even if it goes against what we feel or think. If He does not exist and the Bible is not His Word, then we should listen to our ‚Äúgut‚Äù feelings, as the old commercials said.\nI was on to something when I began the article with the ‚ÄúIf it feels good, do it‚Äù motto; my friend‚Äôs response was ‚ÄúSounds like the mantra of a good party person.‚Äù And he‚Äôs right. If a group of people can get together and think about a particular issue, whatever will come out of the discussion is always a reflection of the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù in the room. If it is a politically liberal setting dominated by atheists, they‚Äôre going to come up with atheist answers to questions about faith; and if it is an evangelical setting dominated by Christians, they will likely come up with Christian answers to questions about faith.\nBoth sides are right only in so far as these are valid avenues of human inquiry. But if you leave the room and walk out into the street, you might as well do a few jumping jacks. There will always be an objective answer to the question of whether or not there is a God; it can be found from anything and anyone who has a rational and logical mind or who has been touched by a divine being. The subjective answers of personal feelings or emotions can only be found in one place: the human heart.\nEvangelism can only be successful if it is based on a predefined worldview and an objective standard. It is not about getting into people‚Äôs heads and thinking like they do or being cool and funny and coming up with an answer they can go along with. It is about setting people free from their sin, from their addictions and from their unbelief by helping them see the light of the world. You can‚Äôt do that to an atheist who has been inoculated to ‚ÄúChristian B.S.‚Äù and will just throw an accusation against the Word of God at you to turn you away. And you can‚Äôt do anything to a person if you yourself have no objective basis on which to stand in the first place, and all you have to offer him are subjective feelings.\nIn order to reach the atheist and the agnostic, you must be able to stand on an objective foundation, to set it out before him and let him try it on. You must be able to say, ‚ÄúI can do so because the Bible says so.‚Äù Otherwise you are just a Christian. If you are a Christian, then you have the answer no matter how ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù it may seem to be because the only real difficulty is the sin which keeps you from seeing the light.\nThe only other option is to join the atheists in their own spiritual darkness and to embrace it as something they are proud of or as a cool way to go.\nOr it is possible to follow my friend‚Äôs advice that ‚ÄúThe best answer, after all, is no answer.‚Äù No answer is a good answer, especially to those who are without; it is a kindness that can only be found in a heart that is humble, a heart that has not been indoctrinated and inoculated against truth. We must not close our doors to such people; we must make sure we leave them open and let them in and hear them out. As long as they remain open to the possibility that what we say is actually objectively true and not just a bunch of B.S., they might just walk out with us."

They also have well established export channels where they can continue to build their technology capabilities in order to produce new and more revolutionary products and services. In many cases, these industries are growing exponentially and becoming powerful worldwide market leaders.\nI am curious to know what people find wrong about these industries? Are they not as good as the western world thinks they are?\nI don't see any such problem... the main thing here is \"the more the government, the less the entrepreneurship\" (http://www.hyperscapex.com/archives/2005/06/22/4123), since these industries rely a lot on entrepreneurship to innovate and discover new paths for their industries.\nHowever, it also should be pointed out that, at the end of the day, these industries still depend on the government for their \"infrastructure\". That is, as long as the government builds roads, provide internet connectivity, have schools, give licenses, etc.; these industries will be able to carry on with their innovation and growth. If any of these infrastructures is disrupted, the government should not be relied upon to recover them (again, that's the main point of the article). Rather, it should focus on creating new infrastructures like \"smart roads\", \"digital cities\", etc.\nIndustries, like individuals and organizations, need to rely more on themselves for their growth and innovation. Instead of focusing on the \"essentials\", the government should focus on creating a more \"permissive\" environment for entrepreneurship and innovation in general (both public and private, by the way). Hopefully, these industries won't be disrupted too much; and if they are, then it would only be a good thing for us, since it would help create more new and innovative industries and technologies, for example :)\nMy main argument is that the government plays very limited role in India. And, that if they want, then they can do anything. Now, I don't want to come across as someone, who is \"anti government\". I am 100% pro-government (at least for Indian governance). What I was trying to argue is that there are areas, where the government have very minimal role, can play more effective roles in other areas, and where they can really help shape the future direction of the economy. And, these are the areas, which I listed above.\nI am wondering if anyone has any comments to share in terms of what they find wrong with the tech areas listed above?\nAgain, many of these industries were well established many years ago (many of them started as private companies). Thus, they had a strong history of innovation and technology transfer, and are continuing to do so with very little government support (in many cases, the opposite is the case). The reason these are such good examples of the things that the government can do (or what we don't want the government to do) is because these industries have been very successful on their own without the government, and are continuing to be successful.\nI agree that the government should really focus on building better and more robust infrastructures (like the \"smart roads\" that you mentioned), but again it should not be focusing the same limited resources on trying to manage everything in the country like a government managed factory. The government's role should be restricted to building the infrastructures, providing a framework for regulating the industry, etc."

The only thing you should do is to analyze the problem and create a good plan to solve it. To practice this technique, do the following exercises. 1. Tom and Martha live next door to Ms. Brown. Each Monday and Wednesday they cut Ms. Brown‚Äôs lawn. One week Ms. Brown wants to be home when they cut her lawn and the next week Tom and Martha want to get together with friends. They agree to alternate Wednesdays when they will cut Ms. Brown‚Äôs lawn. Next week Tom and Martha will cut Ms. Brown‚Äôs lawn. When will Ms. Brown‚Äôs lawn get cut? 2. The students in Mrs. Wilson‚Äôs 4th grade class wanted to practice counting and addition at the same time so they decided to make up a game. They each began with a given amount of money - $10 for those who had good math skills, $15 for those who needed more practice, and $20 for those who were really struggling. The students would take turns rolling the dice and adding the rolls to the money they started off with. After ten rolls of the dice, the student with the most money was the winner. What amount of money should Mrs. Wilson take with to 4th grade class on the first day of school to have an activity for their multiplication table? 3. After a busy"

There is no easy-to-use IDE like Xcode or Visual Studio but I can use the command-line to edit/test/compile. I can also use the CVS/Subversion version control system if needed. The question as it stands now can be reproduced with these commands and settings: `cd /var/www/html/projectname/; ls; ./buildtest.php; cd /var/www/html/projectname/; wget http://www.example.com/file.xml; cd /var/www/html/projectname/; xmlstarlet sel -t -v \"/nswResBuild/nswResBuild/NSW Residential Building Contract for Small Works over $20,000 Designed for residential building work which is not complex over $20,000.

Within this template an xml tag can be selected. The one issue with what you are using is you need to specify the location of the xml file the xsl file is currently loaded in. In your example, the xml file is located in `file.xml`\n\nNow, in order to access elements in this xml file, you can use the below format:\n\n\\begin{code}\n<xsl:template match=\"document\">\n    <xsl:for-each select=\"nswResBuild[nswResBuild/nswBuildType][nswBuildType/nswBuildTypeIdentifier='Building']/nswBuildIdentifier[nswBuildIdentifier/nswLocationIdentifier='NSW']\">\n       "

Don‚Äôt take it from me, though, because this is the best way to do it that I know of.\nYou can have the second act come from a view of Prickles, his side of the story. You can have the second act come from a view of Kesha, his side of the story. And the third act will have the view of the character that‚Äôs neither Prickles or Kesha, the object the characters are trying to make the other one do. The three acts of the play can be told by each individual characters and have each characters story unfold within the third act. This is a fun way to tell a story. The third act, though, will need to be the last act. It will need to be the last part, which shows us how he does the act of what he wants to do with someone else through the other character.\nThe first act is about Prickles, the second act is about the character that wants Prickles to do it. And the third act is about Prickles getting someone else to do it for him.\nTo make it fun and interesting, you can have the character in the third act be someone to Prickles. You can have another character to Kesha, someone that is to Kesha. And the only character in the first act that can be the character in the third act with someone else. A third act in a Shakespeare play is a way of showing that the character does something and another character does it, so that the first character is the object that the third character does the act to them and does it for them. If you look at a Shakespeare play that has a third act, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be the last act. The third act can be a different act, but it has to be the final act with the character getting someone else to do it for him.\nThe first act comes from Prickles, the second act comes from the one Prickles needs to do it, and the third act comes from Prickles getting the person that Kesha needs to get done what Prickles wants to do. This is how it goes, and it may change depending on the play, but if you take this basic idea, you can change around what it is about, the characters and what is going on with them. The idea of Shakespeare is to show us how a character does something for someone, which can be someone to them, or someone for them.\nThird act of Prickles getting the person that Kesha needs to get done what Prickles wants to do.\nYou can have the second act about Prickles, his side of the story, and the third act about Kesha, the other side of the story. Or you can have the second act about Kesha, Prickles‚Äô point of view, and the third act about Prickles, the object of what is going on. It can go either way, and I gave two examples of how to do it. It just all depends on how you tell the story. But to me, the third act is the hardest part to do, because the third act comes from a character being the object, or being on the receiving side of it. The third act is the first act for someone to receive whatever the character wants to bring about. It‚Äôs the final part in the play. It‚Äôs a way of showing what the third act is about, which is what the character does for the object, or the person that the object is for doing whatever the character wants to bring about. It can go either way you look at it, the object or the character, and depending on who the third act is about. It just all depends on if you want to tell the story from the point of view of the character, telling them how they do it for someone else. Or you can tell the story from the third act, who the receiving character is, and then that third act can be from the character that the protagonist does it for. The third act is what you want it to be. Every play is different with how it works out, but if you take"

Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs). Similar items from different fashion brands are suggested to the user based on their previous choice of fashion items. This helps the user to find more suitable choices that fit them better. The user chooses the items that he/she wants to buy, and all the items are delivered directly to his/her home. The technology involved in the process: ‚Ä¢\tNatural language processing (NLP), which includes: ‚Ä¢\tSpeech recognition (SR): the system recognizes and interprets the spoken words by the users. Based on the analysis, a list of relevant keywords (e.g. 'long leg', 'small shoulder') are generated from the text input. These keywords are then classified according to their relevance and accuracy of the input keywords. ‚Ä¢\tText classification: based on the preliminary analyses and the keywords generated from the input text, the system has the capability to classify the keywords into different categories. For example, in the app, the user could enter keywords that are relevant to the measurements of the avatar (e.g. 'long' for height, 'small width' for limbs), in the category 'measurements'. This is in an effort to provide relevant items from the different fashion brands based on the avatar's measurements. An outfit could be a shirt and leggings from 'A' brand, or a sweater and trousers from 'B' brand, if the measurements of the avatar satisfy the requirements of the 'A' and 'B' brands outfits. In addition to the keyword classification, a preliminary analysis could also be conducted on the text to indicate which fashion outfits would suit the personality of the user (e.g. dress could be more suitable for a shy person but leggings and tops would be good for a more playful personality). ‚Ä¢\tContent classification: based on the input text, the system has the capability to classify and sort the content into different types of content (e.g. fashion items, fashion trends, etc), similar to the text classification above. This is done based on the relevance and accuracy of the input text keywords and their related content (e.g. 'red' fashion items would be less relevant to a person who dislikes red, if the input text keywords indicate that the user does not like red). Another classification could be 'recommended fashion brands' and 'recommended fashion outfits' based on the input text keywords and related content, and 'relevant fashion trends' (e.g. based on the fashion items and outfits that have been recommended to users based on the text that they have input). The technology involved behind the app is still relatively new and is currently being researched by many people. However, it involves natural language processing, machine learning, computer vision and deep learning. I hope this helps! Thanks!"

Everyone has their own opinion on this, and with so many different poetic styles and styles of language, I think it will be impossible for us to all agree on one definition.\nWhat I do know is that poetry can mean a range of different things to different people. It can evoke memories or emotions, it can describe an event or place, it can challenge the reader to think about something or it can be as simple as an enjoyable read. As long as the poet can make the reader connect with their work in some way, the piece can be a success.\nPoetry has the ability to speak to different people in different ways, about different subject matters. This, to me, is how I view one definition of what makes a good poem.\nThis is why I find it so appealing; the different types of poetry available to be read. Reading about the experiences of another person is so interesting, and I love the fact that we can share our thoughts on a single poem between us all, in discussion and debate.\nIn my opinion, the best form of poetry is any that is meaningful to the reader, regardless of the style of writing.\nWhat are your thoughts on the different styles of poetry?

Thanks Vishal. You are not allowed to work abroad without your H1B visa. You can switch jobs or your company can change your status to H1B. But the process is cumbersome specially if you are from Middle east. I would suggest you to apply on H1B once it is available. Thanks\nCan we do EB1 from Middle East? Hi there, Thanks for your response. What do you mean by ‚Äòchange your status to H1B‚Äô? Also do we have to go back to India to get stamped in our passport or can we do on the spot as before? Also, can we do it for family as well or only primary applicant? Vishal\nPingback: Immigrant Investor Visa - How it works and Process of EB-5? - Migration Solutions Blog\nCan anyone help to understand the process from filing a H1B to actually getting a Visa? How long all this process takes? And do I need to apply for a Green Card while on a H1B Visa?\nHi Deepa, Thanks for your question. It will take a month or 3 weeks to file your H1B visa from the first date of the fiscal. The visa gets granted in a maximum of 8 weeks after filing. Process takes a while because of many government backlog. It will be a 6 or 7 years on H-1 with a good company. The government has announced that the employer can apply for I140 and EB2-3 green card on same day or during same time in the process. It will speed up the process and you can directly go for adjustment of status (AOS) in US. But the only problem is that the sponsor needs to be approved before AOS. If the green card is approved earlier, your I-140 priority date will get revised and you wont be able to apply AOS from outside and you need to physically go back to US to do adjustment of status on H1 if you are in Middle East. You can try L2 visa and apply L1 once you have it approved and move to US. You will need to have at least 1 year of full time work experience to apply for L1 visa.\nHi Raj, Thanks for responding. I came to know that once you get your H1 approval, you can ask the consulate and they will give you a 221g interview which has become a norm now. This will be the first time I have heard about L2 and L1 visa‚Ä¶how does that work? Also, do I need to apply for a Green Card while on a H1B visa? Thanks!\nRaj Khatri\nDear Deepa, First of all, Congratulations on getting an approved H1B Visa. It‚Äôs wonderful to get it after such an intense process. As far as L1 and L2 visas are concerned, L1 is for Manager or Executive of your Company and it‚Äôs valid for 3 years initially and Extension can be applied beyond 3 years. L2 visa is for spouse or children of L1 visa holder. Generally it‚Äôs not difficult to get L1 or L2 visa, most of the case it‚Äôs done within 60 days and once you have your L1 visa, you can get it Extended or converted to Green Card. But as far as H1B Visa is concerned, it has a validity of 6 years or less, and it‚Äôs also not an easy thing to extend H1B visa beyond its 6 years, you must start applying for Green Card and at least have 1 year or more work experience on H1B to qualify for 140 petition. About L2 and L1 visa, generally consulate is not against L1 visa holder and normally it‚Äôs done in next 3-4 months but if you have any other reasons of concern. If you want more info please feel free to call us or email us we can provide you more information.\nCan I start applying for Green Card while I am on H1? I mean I have applied H1‚Ä¶will they process it and after that I start applying for a Green Card or H1B to H1? Can an H1B holder apply for Green Card before even starting the process of H1B. Do you have any idea how long does that process take? Thanks.\nMigration Solutions Team\nThanks for visiting Migration Solutions! Yes,"

My motivation will also be strong which will keep my competency competitive and productive.\nI do not believe that there are many jobs that requires skills that is outside my field as a civil engineer. With my civil engineering skills, I can use it to create software and tools to manage, analyze data, and work efficiently. Since there are many civil engineers out there, I may need to market my skills and be known as a leader in my field and provide more than what others are capable of to compete. Since I specialize in groundwater, I may need to compete with other individuals that can work efficiently in the field or provide a tool for the field or water resources related industry. My motivation will be strong because I enjoy working with my field, and I enjoy working with water resources. I do not mind competing with other individuals as long as I know that I can provide more than others.\nAs a civil engineer, I know that my experience and education can be applied outside the field of civil engineering. Since I am interested in working with water-related resources, I should specialize in water resources management and use my engineering skills to work with other individuals to identify the needs of the community. Although water-related problems does not require civil engineering, I know that through planning and development, an under performing watershed can be improved and water-related problems can be prevented. However, I should be willing to learn about other fields or areas that may require my assistance. As a specialist working in water related management, I understand that my job may be technical and may involve working with other individuals to identify the best way to improve and manage the area or water-related resources. If my motivation is strong, it can be a big difference if I can work with others or work alone. If I work alone, I can be more productive and faster, however, if I work with others, I can gain new ideas and ways to improve myself. Since motivation is strong, it is important to identify the problems which I can use to work with others to identify the best way to improve it and manage it. Since I am a specialist in water-related resources, I know that I can improve the situation and work with others to improve it. My motivation to work with others can be strong because the problem is bigger than me and I believe that it can be solved through planning, development, and partnerships. The other reason is that through collaborations, I can get new ideas from others in working on the situation.\nPosted by cg1856f\ncg1856f July 17, 2018, 2:55 p.m.\nAs an environmental engineer, I know that my experience and education can be applied with other areas of engineering related to water resources. However, I still need to improve my skills in hydrology, chemistry, and others to provide more knowledge to solve water related problems. Since water is the source of life, I need to know how to manage it and protect it by finding solutions that will benefit us all. Since working with water-related resources will always require a high level of creativity, I should be open to ideas that others can present to solve the problems. As an environmental engineer, I can work alongside other people to learn from their experience and education to solve the problems that may require different fields of expertise. Since motivation is important when working with other people, I should know the importance of working together, learning from each other, and sharing ideas to ensure a successful outcome. As a specialist in water-related resources, I know that my work can contribute to the well being of the community and I can provide ways to improve water related resources that may benefit many people. If my motivation is strong, it can be a big difference in making a positive impact on the community. If I work alone, I can be more productive but it will also limit my creativity and learning because it will prevent me from accessing other areas of knowledge for water-related resources. If I work with others, I can be more creative and productive.\nTo make a positive impact on the community, I need the commitment, support, and trust from others that I will do a good job and provide a solution that will be beneficial to many people. As an environmental engineer, I need to learn more about hydrology and chemistry and other areas of knowledge to provide services related to water-related resources.

Good luck!\n10.) A BIRD IN THE HAND-- by Emily Dickenson\n-- Poetry is life, but not as we know it\nIf you're confused, don't be. The poem is just as it says, and no more or less than that. We're going to look at the words and see how the poet's choice of words and punctuation really conveys the idea of her poem.\nAsk Yourself These Questions: When we read the first line, and even the second \"What is the tone of this poem?\" \"Who is the speaker in this poem?\" \"Why does Dickenson use an \"iambic\" (stressed and unstressed syllables) metrical pattern instead of an iambic \"feet\" (four iambs at the end of the line)?

Do you think we need a poem like this today? Why or why not?\n11.) \"CATCHING\" by Joy Harjo is a poem that I think we can all relate to because we all \"miss\" or yearn for moments from the past. The speaker wonders if \"catching\" another person means going back to the past or finding something from it to bring forward. What do you think?\n1. Read the poem. What do you notice about the text? (Do you need to highlight or underline lines for this? If so, do it at this point!\n2. What does the speaker want?\n3. Why does the speaker want that? What does s/he hope to gain by it?\n4.

Can you find examples of figurative language (i.e. similes, metaphors, alliteration, personification, hyperbole) in the poem?\n6. What is the \"message\" of the poem?\n7. Does it make you think about things differently? How?\n1. Read \"Rainbow in the Mud\" by Langston Hughes.\n2. What is the title of the poem? (Notice that you cannot figure this out from what the speaker says in the poem.) Write down \"the title of the poem\" in the blank.\n3. What is the speaker telling us the title of the poem is about?

Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\nTanaka Co. produces a product called ‚ÄúX‚Äù, for which there is a high demand. The company is having difficulty satisfying customers because of a lack of resources needed for production. Tanaka has three production plants, two located in New York State, one in Ohio, two different types of machines for producing ‚ÄúX‚Äù, two different types of raw materials, and two different types of skilled labor. What constraints should be imposed to best match available resources with the demand for ‚ÄúX‚Äù? Justify your answer using the Pareto Principle, i.e. stating if 70% of ‚ÄúX‚Äù demand can not be satisfied, which specific resources should be cut short to meet the remaining 30%.\nPareto efficiency occurs when no further reductions are possible in order to improve any individual‚Äôs well being.\nAn individual is better off, and the improvement adds to the satisfaction of individual choices. In this case, given that the production plant and skilled personnel are already utilized for maximum efficiency, the only two potential components to cut short will be the availability of raw materials and the machines. This could either mean ordering the raw materials in advance or reducing the demand for the product, thereby also reducing the number of machines used.\nQuestion 2 (Cash and Accrual Accounting, Preparation of 45,000 square feet of asphalt pavement, and Preparation of a Bank Statement for $129,200 with interest calculations)\nA large apartment complex wanted to expand their parking lot by an additional 45,000 square feet. The contract was awarded to K & Associates for $8 per square foot. What would be an acceptable cash payment by the apartment complex and what amount must be paid in advance to K & Associates? What amount of work has already been completed by December 31?\nCash payments are required for payment of expenses for which invoices are received after the end of the year, or for which invoices are received at the beginning of the year for which payments are actually made after the end of the year.\nThus, any outstanding expense for which K & Associates has not been paid by December 31 and for which an invoice is received after December 31 and before they have been paid, must be paid for in cash.\nSimilarly, any expense for which the company has already been paid during the year, but is invoiced after December 31, must also be paid for in cash.\nFor the second option, wherein the invoice for expense is received before December 31 and payment is made after December 31, K & Associates should be paid in cash, by subtracted the $16,000 received in advance by December 31 from the total amount payable of $144,000. Thus, $128,000 must be paid in advance in cash. If the company pays for expense of $44,000 per month and $100,000 is paid as an advance, then the balance of $44,000 will be paid by December 31.\nTo calculate the percentage of work done for which payment has been made by December 31, divide the amount of work ($50,000) by total amount to be paid ($144,000) and multiply by 100. Thus, 36% of work has been paid for.\nThe balance of the work that is to be done will need to be paid by K & Associates in advance, which will not be received as payment before December 31. To calculate, first calculate the amount of work that is to be done in advance as part of the invoice received by December 31 ($50,000). Then calculate the remaining amount for which no invoice is received ($15,000), which must be included for the remaining expense. Then calculate the total amount to be paid as invoices are received ($140,000). Subtract total of invoices to be paid from total of invoices received ($140,000-$"

        "output": "How would the Future of AI in 10 Years look?\nJump to navigation Jump to search AI is a field of technology characterized by the use of automated systems to solve complex problems and perform human-like tasks through a variety of means such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. In this regard, the future of AI could look a little like the film, ‚ÄúHer‚Äù ‚Äì where advanced computer technologies become so advanced that they learn from human beings in a kind of symbiosis. In fact, there has been exponential growth in AI since the movie, with Google‚Äôs voice assistant, Siri and Amazon‚Äôs Alexa have opened up new possibilities in AIs interconnectivity with humans. AI is also gaining traction in areas of healthcare technology and autonomous vehicles. So what does the future of AI look like? As time goes by, more and more intelligent machines are being designed to assist human beings in executing daily tasks, and it is clear that humans have a lot to gain from AI.\nAI is also beginning to take hold in medicine, with studies suggesting AI can be used to speed up diagnoses and offer more accurate and efficient healthcare ‚Äì allowing early detection of conditions and diseases. For that reason alone, there is significant opportunity for AI to change the way healthcare works worldwide. As AI becomes more developed ‚Äì and as its capabilities become more useful in medicine ‚Äì there will be even more potential for this to have a huge impact on healthcare. If AI is able to increase diagnostic accuracy, and streamline the speed of diagnosis ‚Äì it could not only increase quality of life but reduce long-term healthcare costs too. On that note, researchers have said that AI could also help to increase the accuracy of genetic tests and cut costs by 50%. As we stand right now, AI is still a relatively new field, with lots of growth potential. Although we are still just scratching the surface, it is clear that there is so much that AI can do for human beings.\nBy looking at examples like Amazon‚Äôs Alexa, Google‚Äôs voice assistance technologies, and self-driving cars ‚Äì we can begin to see that AI has the potential to transform how we live, allowing us to take on more efficient and less stressful lifestyles and allowing us to access more information than ever before.\nFrom a business perspective, as AI becomes more advanced, businesses and organizations can look forward to a significant efficiency and cost-saving advantage over their competitors. Machine Learning Algorithms and Advanced Analytics Solutions can lead to more accurate forecasting, which helps businesses prepare for seasonal changes quickly and efficiently. The same holds true for retail businesses, who can use AI to make better-informed purchasing decisions about products and services.\nFurther ahead, AI could lead to significant efficiency and cost-savings for the global workforce. For now, advancing areas like chatbots, robo-advisors, and autonomous cars will reduce the need for human manual labor. As the algorithms become smarter, and as AI becomes more developed, this trend could become even more prevalent. If we look even further ahead, AI technology could even be used to create a new kind of workforce. Instead of relying on human employees, companies like Uber, Microsoft and Google are already using AI to drive their software services. In the future, it could be possible for a company‚Äôs entire workforce to be made up of robots and AI technologies, freeing people from manual labor and allowing them time to focus on other important activities like research and development.\nThis could create a huge potential for the global workforce, and allow for a workforce more focused on tasks that are more creative ‚Äì which we‚Äôre sure the future will see as integral to human progress. As time goes by, it is clear AI will continue to transform business and the way we do our jobs.\nIt is clear from the examples listed above that AI is set to benefit humans in more ways than one, with research suggesting that AI will create a global economic boost of 15.7 trillion dollars by 2030. AI will also lead to a larger workforce, as it creates more efficiency in business, leading to more job and career opportunities for people from across the globe. As AI continues to grow and develop, it will have even more potential to do good for humanity.\nIt is still unclear as to what the future of AI will look like exactly, however we can expect a lot of technological innovation and advancements; with a greater focus on innovative AI technologies that can help to increase efficiency, quality of life and offer significant cost-saving"

But this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nIt was the German banks that bailed out the economy when it was still in deep recession in 2009, enabling it to recover so quickly and set it on the path for sustainable growth.\nAnd it is the German government that, in many ways, is helping to cement the city‚Äôs position as the hip capital of Europe:\n‚Äì The government invests billions in renovation and cultural projects, and allows residents to turn their apartments into a business without extra taxes.\n‚Äì The creative economy is actively supported in Berlin, with hundreds of millions of euros each year spent on film production, small and medium enterprises, fashion and the digital economy.\n‚Äì The government has paved the way for innovative new districts, such as in Neuk√∂lln or Kreuzberg, and is allowing developers to build new and affordable housing, which will hopefully help to ease the housing shortage.\nMany foreigners have become permanent residents of Berlin in recent years, and a thriving startup scene has been accompanied by a boom in creativity.\nThere has also been a boom in immigration from countries around the world, bringing unique perspectives and diversifying the city‚Äôs culture, which has in turn helped it remain true to its roots.\nOverall, Berlin has continued to develop as a place where people are happy to live, work and enjoy themselves ‚Äì and will no doubt remain the capital of cool for many years to come.\n1. Why did the author mention German banks and the German government?\nA German bank had bailed out Berlin‚Äôs economy.\nThe German government had allowed the cities to bail to fix the economy.\nThe banks played an important part in Berlin‚Äôs economic growth.\nThe German government has played a crucial role in Berlin‚Äôs development\n2. Why did the author mention Neuk√∂lln and Kreuzberg?\nThe author wanted to show how the government helps Berlin to grow and adapt.\nThe author had forgotten those areas when writing the article.\nThe areas are the most popular hotspots of the city‚Äôs culture.\nTheir existence shows how the economy is adapted to the new demands of the community.\n3. What is the main point of the passage?\nThe German government is responsible for the city‚Äôs growth.\nBerlin‚Äôs economy will soon collapse again.\nBerlin is a great place of economic and cultural development.\nThe government has turned Berlin into an international leader."

I think that as more machines enter our world, this may pose a problem with how we communicate between one another and how we are able to express our human emotions in a meaningful way. Furthermore, I believe that technology may take away our ability to be creative with our minds and with our bodies. For example, many of us today do not write by hand because it is easier and more efficient to type. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this ineffective writing in...\n... Technology is everything that doesn't work yet. Technology is so advanced now that it is everything that we have been dreaming to have and it is here right before our eyes. Technology has evolved so much in the last decades to where we are now where we can have any object that we can dream of and there is so many opportunities in the technological world. Technology can also be one of the worst thing that humans can have because it is everything that can cause bad, but still good can be found in technology. Technology is a positive thing in today‚Äôs society because it helps us solve problems easier, helps us communicate around the world, helps us do other important tasks that would make the job go faster and helps us do work easier that it used to be many years ago. Also computers and the internet allows people to communicate with others around the world making it a better social interaction and also to share thoughts and ideas from different languages in a faster way. All technology is good because the inventions help improve society in today‚Äôs world, like computers, the internet, iPhones which is a mobile technology device that can keep you connected to your family, your job; text messaging, apps, and other different software to get your work done more efficiently. Also the technology that we have today was not all there since the beginning there were...\n...ÔªøTechnology is everything that doesn't work yet. One of the main reasons is that technology has evolved so much it has made a world change. Technology has changed society to become more dependent on it, more accessible to information, and has improved our life. The world has become more technological because technology provides a lot of convenience to life in many ways and it helps in the growth and development of the world. It has made it easier and more efficient in doing the job because technology has reduced labor costs. Technology has made society more dependent on it because the more technology improves that more people want it to do more things. Technology nowadays can reach anywhere around the world because it‚Äôs so easy to use and more accessible to get it and has improved the way things are done. For example, the internet is a major part of technology that changed the life of many people around the world. It helps connect people from different backgrounds and share ideas information and many more from different societies. It allows people to communicate with others in many different ways for example; email letters, phone calls, text messages, and video calls. Technology also improved society by educating people, helping the environment, and also helps to develop culture and the arts.

The technology made our life easier and save our time for other things. But at the same time, some people believe that technology is having negative effects on both society and the individual. Technology is something that constantly changes and evolves almost everyday. Technology has had a huge impact on today‚Äôs society in a positive way. First of all, technology makes things much easier, which makes life more convenient. Some people don‚Äôt have time to go to library and collect books or information, but nowadays people can use many resources on the Internet like Wikipedia to gather more information in just few minutes. Technology can also help save time. For example, we can pay bills online; we don‚Äôt need to go physically to an office to pay or send money or we can book tickets and get an information online. Moreover, technology helps us save energy. For example I use my laptop to do homework instead of using books from the library. Besides, technology changes society, for example internet change our life a lot. Nowadays, people communicate with others through the help of Internet and social media (Facebook, twitter,...) like that it enables people to learn new things which are not possible if the Internet does not exist.

I thought that was a stupid idea then and still think it is now. ‚Äì Gilles 'SO'\nI have to admit that I don't fully understand the mechanics behind this idea as much as I'd like too due to the fact that I'm not good with the math stuff in computer science. I fully understand basic code and programming, but the more advanced and complex programs and things involving code like this confuse me. It's my understanding that malbolge was created to be a type of programming language that has a way to make malicious programs be able to infect and corrupt systems in a way that you and I would have never thought able to actually be able to happen. If this is indeed a program that you created, then you need to be working on a way to come up with a way to stop this program from being possible to use if in fact there are any other ways to stop it. I understand that this may be a hard proposition to have to come up with a way that can be used in the future to prevent this type of a program being able to be able to infect and corrupt systems, but at least you can try in the future to be able to find ways that won't make this such difficult challenge in trying to be a way that can be used to protect people's computer systems and devices from any type of type of program that may want to be able to be able to infect and corrupt their systems and damage their devices and files on their systems. I completely understand that your not a computer scientist by any means, but I do know that you've got the best technology and know how to come up with new and innovate technology when others and other companies can come up with new things. To be able to come up with ways to protect other's computer systems that are trying to protect them and their files and data on their systems while doing things such as online shopping and banking is not a easy challenge. I do know that you've got the right tech and people in your company to be able to come up with ways to try and stop this type of program from being usable, but it definitely is not going to be easy especially since this is such a new development. I hope that the tech and scientist's over in your company that know more about the computer science and how the malbolge programs work will be able to come up with a way that will be able to stop this type of program being able to work being it has the ability to infect and corrupt one's systems.

Thanks in advance\nSolo Programming Tips\nI do have plans to share some ideas on how to make programming a lonely activity much more enjoyable in time. In the meanwhile I thought I'd share some of the most useful suggestions I've heard on the topic from various places.\n1. Find (make!) a development environment that suits you\nYour development environment can be anything that lets you get your code running. From a text editor/code completion solution like Sublime/Atom/Vim to a full blown IDE like NetBeans/PDT / Eclipse/Visual Studio. I personally prefer an environment that can support my needs on all fronts: I need a reliable source code management solution, I need a powerful Java/Android/PHP/iOS/Python/Python interpreter/IDE and I need access to an up-to-date version of each of the popular software libraries I need. The best environment I have found for that is Java/PHP development environment IDEA. I have used every other tool on offer but haven't found one that offers the same degree of integration, reliability and flexibility.\nI don't think that the ideal development environment is the only key to a successful solo project. When I started working solo I didn't have access to such an environment and still managed to deliver a working product. I'd say that if you can learn to code and write your first program you can learn to build your own reliable development environment too. But for any serious solo project an ideal development environment does matter a lot.\n2. Decide up front when and how often to take breaks\nThis doesn't mean that it should stop you from working for good but it's a decision you need to make every time you start working. I am one of those programmers that like frequent breaks. I take breaks (at least one every hour) which means that I work longer and can deliver projects faster but I also end up with a much higher degree of \"bug-induced sleepiness\" - something I am still trying to cure. The best advice on this topic that I found is from Joel Spolsky, which basically states that any programmer capable of working intensely for 8 straight hours is capable of working just as many hours per day if he/she does it frequently in short bursts, but is much less productive if working long hours in one go. His article \"The Paperboy\" has a lot of useful thoughts on the subject.\nBut don't underestimate the importance of breaks. If your job is writing code you need to recharge your batteries from time to time or you won't be able to do it productively and you'll suffer a burnout. On my worst days I go days without taking a proper break. On my best days I take lots of short 15 minute breaks and I still manage to code for 8 hours. The break schedule is something you need to decide up front and take into account when planning the project. It's just as important as the project requirements and the deadline.\n3. Learn your limits, accept them and manage to work around them\nI don't like the title very much because it implies that there's not very much that can be done if you hit some sort of limitation in your skill set or resources. But what it really means is that you must learn how to push your limits but not violate them.\nSometimes in a project you come up with some requirement that sounds pretty impossible to implement in a given time frame. What you need to decide is if the requirement can be implemented given your skillset and resources. You need to carefully consider if there's a way of meeting the requirement using existing tools or if you need to use a different approach, find a different tool or even change the requirements slightly. Either way you need to make your decisions based on facts and not on fear. If you find that a requirement can't be met you must determine if is worth delaying the project to meet the requirement or if it should be dropped. Don't push yourself over a cliff. Once you start overloading yourself you'll end up crashing or at least damaging your personal code quality metric which will hurt you in the long run.\n4. Find/Be your own most efficient self\nEvery developer works differently. Some work better under pressure, some work better in the early morning and some work better with their feet up on the desk. Whatever your favorite conditions are there are still 2 things you need to manage no matter what: your mental/personal state and your physical health/well-being.\nIf you need to"

The fraud here did not occur in a far away nation. This fraud took place in an institution of higher education called a university. This should make people all over the nation very uncomfortable with an institution that is supposed to be the best, the wisest, and the most discriminating. It is supposed to be the place to learn how to become an enlightened, wise, and discriminating, citizen. Instead, it can appear that a person who is obviously not so wise and discerning has been given the right to teach.

Specifically, I tend to be prone to nausea the day after, and headaches. I've previously tried to sip water between the alcoholic drinks, but still experienced nausea that night. What should I do specifically to alleviate these symptoms? Is my situation different from that of others? Will a high tolerance necessarily lead to unpleasant symptoms the next day?\nThank you for any help that this website/users can give me.\nWell you are kind of in luck and you are kind of in not so lucky. It kind of comes down to the fact that your tolerance is such that you can drink but it is almost impossible to drink socially with others without having some consequences the next day. If I were in your shoes I'd say you should stick to drinking alone. Some others may disagree but I definitely would avoid drinking with buddies because they can do a number on your tolerance.\nYou may want to consider the fact that you need a break from drinking too. Its possible that if you just didn't drink for a month you may have some gains in your tolerance.\nThat is how I got started in Alcoholism. I decided that I needed a break. So I started by not going out to bars and just stayed home, and then I stopped going out to bars and started staying home. Pretty soon I realized that I didn't need to drink so I didn't drink.\nBut there is hope. Alcoholics do recover. If you decide that you would like to be in control of your own life, you're going to have to accept the fact that you don't have to drink.\nYou don't need to drink. You don't need to be drinking to be liked or feel welcome or have any sort of social life. All you need is to have an open mind, determination and the will to not be controlled by booze.\nIt's a journey but it's one that will be worth it.\nI'm not going to tell you to go to meetings, because that's not going to work for you. But you are going to have to make some changes. You're going to have to stop drinking and you are going to have to deal with some serious, painful feelings.\nBut if you make the changes you will recover. It's totally possible to recover from a drinking problem without AA. You can go it alone, if that's what you want to do. But it is going to take some serious sacrifice, real determination and a strong willingness to change your own behavior.\nThe bottom line is that you are addicted to Alcohol. And just like any other addiction, if you don't do anything, nothing is going to change.\nIt's nice that you've never had a problem with drug use, but that doesn't mean you don't have a problem. If you're still drinking you are still addicted and you don't have control over your own life, Alcohol controls you.\nIf you still think you have a problem with alcohol use, I think you need to be honest with yourself and see if you truly want to recover. That's what recovery means. If you want to recover, you have to truly acknowledge that you have a problem. And if you have a problem that means that you need help to get yourself onto the road to recovery, to a life with which your not controlled by a substance which is going to wreak havoc on your body, mind and spirit.\nThe truth is if you could quit on your own you would have done it already. You need help. You need help with your body AND your mind. Just like a diabetic needs insulin to get well, you need help to get well from your drinking problem."

Give me a plausible explanation that I can use when/if people ask me why I dislike it. Please?\nAJPenna wrote: I have to say, I've almost completely stopped watching TV. Partly it's that the shows I watch on any given network (TBS, A&E, USA) have all been pushed out to Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Sometimes I'll watch them on cable or Netflix or something, but most of the time I just wait for the DVDs to come out and then watch all they want in a marathon of one, two, or sometimes three discs in a row. With a little online Googling, I can always keep up on any new episodes, upcoming guest stars, and whatever else any of my favorite shows are doing.\nI'm going to have to disagree with you. While it is not the best idea, especially when it comes to keeping news, fresh, having your main source be online is not as bad as you're making it out to be. While I do appreciate the fact that shows like \"The Office\" are showing more and more how important it is that we keep the news in the headlines and new info fresh, when it comes to shows that have already aired, I see no problem in having the entire season on DVD... and actually, it's the DVD that I would check out on the site with the show.\nMy problem with the main media source today is the instantaneity of the news source. Too much is said that's in a hurry, without proper research, and in an extreme rush for the information to get out. While this is not a bad thing in and of itself, there are too many people on the internet that take information and run with it, instead of doing some research and checking the facts.\nIt bothers me no end when people say 'the media are all flacks for the gov't... or for the 'other' party... or the 'other' government. I know that there are many flacks and people who have ulterior motives out there, but when it comes to the media (and I'm talking print and all other media but especially television and radio), the media is about the information: the news. It is not the job of the media to take sides. It is the job of the media to present the information, and let you, the general public, look at what's going on and decide for YOURSELF what's going on and what's the truth behind it.\nThe information for the most part, as long as it's NOT being censored, is available. Too many people are afraid of the truth, and the information (which is NOT ALL GOOD).\nEven though I personally am of the opinion that government regulation is not necessarily a bad thing IF it's done properly (and is not used to cover up the truth from the general public, which too many times is exactly what it's used for), I am not the type to say that the government is the devil, and the media are the other evil.\nI hope that my opinions make sense here... and I hope that this hasn't taken up too much of your time or become too long of a comment... and I hope that you do not take this as personally attacking your profession... but I don't think that I know a single person in it (at least, I don't think they're doing it as their full time job...) and I do think that the media is being used by the government... and that in some cases, it is more of a liability than an asset.\nNow, I really am going to wrap this up here... it's the third time in one day that I've written something out and then decided that no, I could not justify it (and then went ahead and justified it) and I'm getting a little tired of it, so it's time for me to put in my last thoughts and quit for the day!\nGood night, and... well, I think that's going to say it all for now... I think it's pretty obvious by now why I've put in all that stuff, what I'm trying to say, and why I think it's important for me to say it to YOU in particular... for a whole bunch of reasons.

The program then takes the incoming signal and processes it by performing things like filtering, demodulation, amplification, and other processing functions. It then displays the incoming signal along with the frequency spectrum, time spectrum, and the output of the processing functions on the computer screen. This can help to detect and locate the drone. You can use a software defined radio either to locate a drone while it is flying over or to look for a drone that has landed without your knowing it.

        "instruction": "can stainless steel be magnetic in some instances?",
        "output": "can stainless steel be magnetic in some instances? Stainless steel can become magnetic, but there's no standard for how strong that magnetism is. There are, however, a few ways to reduce the likelihood of stainless steel becoming magnetized. ‚Ä¢ Avoid overly cold temperatures. The magnetization in a piece of stainless steel can be enhanced by low temperatures, so keeping metal warm is recommended. ‚Ä¢ Minimize exposure to magnets. Magnetic fields can enhance magnetization in stainless steel, so avoid being close to strong magnets. Can you be magnetic? Yes, and no. Magnetic fields, such as those made by electric motors, are very strong. You can't \"hold yourself\" to a magnet, but you can be attracted to it. Magnetic fields can cause a piece of stainless steel to become magnetic, so avoid magnetic fields as much as possible, but they're definitely not unmanageable. It may be wise to avoid cold temperatures and strong magnetic fields after using products made of stainless steel. If you have any concerns about the magnetization of stainless steel, please contact your doctor or healthcare professional. Can stainless steel rust? While stainless steel doesn't rust, it can tarnish. Stainless steel isn't completely impenetrable to rust, but it has a much higher tolerance than many metals. When exposed to extreme moisture, rust can form on stainless steel, but it doesn't mean that the metal is damaged. If rust does form on stainless steel, there are ways to remove it. You can use a stainless steel cleaner to remove rust stains when they're fresh, but a gentle bleaching agent will also work if you're dealing with mild to persistent rust stains. You can also soak a piece of stainless steel in vinegar and water to remove rust stains. If you notice rust stains on your stainless steel when you're not sure if they're mild or severe, it's probably best to have a metalworker look at them and fix any structural damage. If you're not comfortable using these solutions, you can also ask your metalworker to apply a protective coating to your stainless steel to prevent future rust stains. Can stainless steel rust or tarnish? While stainless steel can tarnish, it doesn't rust. Stainless steel can become tarnished, but you can limit its susceptibility to tarnish by keeping it away from moisture, as well as away from other metals that you know can cause rust. If you do notice tarnish on your stainless steel, you can use a stainless steel cleaner to remove it from non-porous stainless steel, but if you're finding that it stains easily, it may be time to speak to a professional about your stainless steel. For more information on keeping your stainless steel shiny, or if you're interested in having this material applied to a new project, please contact your local metalworking experts today.\nIs stainless steel magnetic to a magnet? Stainless steel isn‚Äôt magnetic, contrary to common belief, but it‚Äôs still not a free pass for magnets. In fact, there may be risks involved if you‚Äôre not paying close enough attention. Stainless steel is an alloy made of iron and at least 10% chromium. It can be used to craft anything from sinks and cookware to bicycles and industrial equipment, and it has impressive corrosion-resistance. Stainless steel is magnetic in theory, but the magnetic fields produced by a magnet will be too dispersed to significantly affect the material. Stainless steel is a ferrous alloy, but it has a higher proportion of chromium than iron. Since ferrous materials respond to magnetism, and chromium has the ability to produce a magnet‚Äôs magnetic fields to a lesser degree, stainless steel can be considered magnetic‚Äîbut only in theory at best. There simply aren‚Äôt the proportions available for a magnet to produce a significant enough field to cause significant magnetic effects. Stainless steel may feel magnetic, but the only way to be sure that it isn‚Äôt magnetic is to check the technical specifications of that particular material. If stainless steel isn‚Äôt magnetic, it may be magnetic if the proportions are different. It‚Äôs worth noting that certain types of stainless steel might be magnetic. Since this is so much more common, it‚Äôs important to know about the risks involved with stainless steel and magnets. If stainless steel isn"

        "instruction": "Can you explain Fermat's Last Theorem?",
        "output": "Can you explain Fermat's Last Theorem? No, not with a proof. But there are proofs involving elliptic curves that show FLT is true and then you can explain what the theorem is saying. A good intro book is Michael Atiyah's \"Introduction to Modern Algebra\" though there are others.\nBesides the Wikipedia articles on elliptic curves and FLT, I would recommend reading a standard textbook such as \"Number Fields\" by Neukirch.\nA more elementary textbook on elliptic curves (but harder to understand) is N. H. M. Irving. \"Elliptic Curves\".\nFor another introduction to elliptic curves, the following notes may be of use.\nThere are a bunch on the web.\nI would just look for a standard textbook on elliptic curves. There aren't really any \"intuitive\" textbooks that I know of, as an introduction to elliptic curves it will probably be hard to find something that doesn't just use the basic concepts instead of giving you \"proofs that you'll eventually understand\". One that I used was \"Linear Algebra and Geometry in the Complex Plane\" by K. H. Hasse, which was really good as an introduction to elliptic curves.\nIf you want an introduction to some abstract mathematical ideas from algebra, number theory, and geometry, I'd recommend reading John Stillwell, John Gilbert, and Charles W. Miller's book Geometry From An Alter Ego Perspective. It's a really easy read that introduces various notions and concepts in an inductive style, and it's more focused on intuition than giving proofs. They present a lot of notions about elliptic curves, but they don't bother with proofs (except in the last chapter).\nMost standard text books on elliptic curves that I am aware of are quite pedantic and technical in their approach, and might require students to be well-versed in basic abstract algebra, so that they don't get lost when reading those books (they usually talk a lot about other basic mathematical ideas from abstract algebra that are important in elliptic curve theory).\nOne I like a lot is Nigel H.M. Irving, Elliptic Curves. Cambridge University Press, 1998.\nI guess one thing I find quite intuitive about elliptic curves is the so-called \"Weierstrass model\", which involves a special form called \"Weierstrass elliptic function\" that is defined by the equation y2 = x3 + Ax + B. (I'm not sure if there's a name for the simplest case of this equation.) To me, this seems quite intuitive. Basically, it's a sort of parabola with the vertex at (0,0) and the axis of symmetry along the x-axis. To me, this also implies that the discriminant of this equation is 0/4, which explains why it occurs in Fermat's Last Theorem (which states that xn + yn = zn can be solved if &#940; has square-free), which involves the equation x2 y2 = z2. I'm not sure what the actual significance of this equation is, but it seems to me that the special form of elliptic curves that I mention above is very relevant to explaining this.\nThis book may be a good introduction, but personally I don't find this book very useful or \"intuitive\" because it talks too much about various notions from abstract algebra required to solve specific kinds of elliptic curve equations, and it doesn't talk much about elliptic curves and doesn't give examples and illustrations of interesting mathematical ideas. It's just too \"techie\" and too verbose in terms of explaining concepts and ideas. I feel that if you're only looking to learn what an elliptic curve is, it might be better to look at a different textbook, or even a book on elliptic functions for that matter.\nAs far as I know, elliptic curves are defined through the Weierstrass representation. I would check out some books you are interested and see what you find there. If you don't mind a little bit of computer science, I think you can learn a lot from \"Elliptic Curves\". There is a nice book \"The number field sieve\" that gives an intuitive introduction to NFS without any heavy math. The first 2 chapters of Galois' \"M√©moire sur le th√©or√®me d'une application d√©finie en toute partie du plan\" is a great start (it is also the first chapter of his book \"G√©om√©trie alg√©brique\").\nNot the answer you're looking for?

It is a 400 page novel and the price we negotiate will be based on the number of words in the manuscript. I'm currently writing a novel on a deadline and I need to have it edited by November 1st if possible. Please note that this project will be done on a best efforts basis, as it is already written and I do not need anyone to help me write it, just help me edit it and make it better.

        "output": "I live in New Zealand. Given the regulations here, would it be possible for me to own an operational fighter jet? If so, what steps would I need to take to be qualified to fly it? (Would I have to qualify as an aviator? Or is a pilot's licence sufficient?) Additionally, at the time I would like to purchase, they would be relatively inexpensive. What sort of cost would be expected? I do have an income of ~$250,000 net - would this qualify me to buy or rent an operational fighter jet? I am aware that these would be extremely rare and expensive but would it be possible to work towards one of these?\nI ask because it was always something I have been interested in since I was very young however it has proved to be very difficult. With the advent of these auctions, this seems like a perfect opportunity as I would not be the type to purchase one just to keep it for a collection, but would be very keen to actually learn how to fly it and get some hands-on experience.\nf-16 jet-fighters ownership civilian-aviation\n$\\begingroup$ The cost for a fighter jets is not as cheap as you may think, but also not as high as a private civilian person can afford. The training hours and flying hours is as well quite expensive in the time you spend in the cockpit. So you better have a goal to achieve something with the airplane and not just sit in it once a month. Fighters are not made for pleasure flying either. $\\endgroup$ ‚Äì jknaier Apr 2 '18 at 6:22\n$\\begingroup$ It would be worth your while to take a flight in a F-16, though. I'm sure that some of the air forces (not just the USAF) would be okay with that, and that might get you more motivated than just reading about them. $\\endgroup$ ‚Äì jamesqf Apr 2 '18 at 6:23\n$\\begingroup$ F-16'S? Aircraft are extremely expensive, you are looking at multiple hundreds of thousands (if you are lucky with a used one), and you don't have the time to qualify by any means. But if you have the money, and you want to do it, go for it. Just be prepared that it will take a lot of your money and time to even get a single flight. $\\endgroup$ ‚Äì ShemSeger Apr 2 '18 at 12:56\n$\\begingroup$ Yes, if you have the money, and you want to do it, go for it. Just be prepared that it will take a lot of your money and time to even get a single flight. $\\endgroup$ ‚Äì ShemSeger Apr 2 '18 at 12:57\n$\\begingroup$ Flying with the USAF wouldn't be prohibitively expensive with a 250,000 salary. If you wanted to fly one of our fighter jets you would have to be hired and would likely be a pilot and not just an engineer. The training required to fly a fighter jet in the USAF is quite rigorous. $\\endgroup$ ‚Äì JBentley Apr 2 '18 at 20:09\nNo, not very likely. Unless you are in a country where military aircraft are exempted from import regulations, which is unlikely, you will have to import it, which is also an unlikely event. A Cessna would be much easier.\nIf you wanted to fly an aircraft bought from the military, you would have to arrange it as an experimental aircraft. This would be a long and expensive process, which would likely require flight training. I would not recommend it; if you want to fly an airplane, get a real one, not one that the military has already abandoned.\nAnother complication with military aircraft is that you would have to have the airworthiness release from the originator of the aircraft in order to operate it. This is not a problem once you have the release, but it is a problem to secure it in the first place.\nThe airworthiness and importation process is explained here:\nhttp://www.faasafety.gov/files/gsa/files/CAP4050.pdf\n$\\begingroup$ You don't need to import a militarily surplus or retired aircraft into an EU country. An EU Member State can legally import aircraft in this category from other Member States without any problem. Such aircraft are regarded as \"non-state\" aircraft by the Member State responsible for import"

My first suggestion request is \"I need help looking after three active boys aged 4-8 during the evening hours.\". How do I put it more clearly and more focused?\n\nComment: When you say \"active\" do you mean they get in to a lot of mischief or just that they are always on the move? As for your question, I think it's a bit ambiguous as to what you actually want to be doing. A more specific request would be \"I need help watching the kids in the evenings\" or something like that. And it would also specify who you are looking for. For instance, \"We are looking for a mature individual who is at least sixteen and who will take this position seriously\".\n\nComment: I didn't know what to call \"active boys\". They are boys, their ages 4-7 years. They are lively, friendly, they sometimes play in the dark in their rooms. As for the request I mentioned, it seems to be a bit vague. I wanted to put it simply because I would make a request more focusing and concrete. But I do not know how I can say it precisely (to whom I am addressing)???\n\nComment: I mean that you will let the boys be boys until they are in trouble, but you'll make sure they aren't into mischief that would harm them or others. I find this is what is implied by most people who refer to children as \"active\". So when you write a request, I would try to clarify that you won't mind if they play in the dark, but you don't want them running around your house when you are at dinner, say, or if they wake you in the middle of the night. Also, some details might help you decide who to hire. For instance, if the boys have a tendency to play rough, say.\n\nComment: Hi, I'd say \"I need someone to supervise my three young boys aged 4-8\" and also point out that they are active and sometimes noisy when you're trying to watch TV.

John Crawford, john at c-r-a-w-f-o-r-d. Com dot. And the I's all caps, and the dot's just a period. Com.\nHi. Good afternoon CBD life. My name is Michael and I have been purchasing CBD products on the dark web for a while. The site that I do the most business on is called CBD and co. This is a website that not too long ago started to come under scrutiny from the DEA for selling a variety of cannabinoids and other products that are prohibited in most parts of the country including Canada. As it turns out it is the FBI that has been doing the heavy lifting on this investigation which has led to the site being shut down but also the site's owner to be taken into custody. Now the FBI states that the owner of this site was running a rogue operation and was not authorized by the DEA to be selling, making or distributing these products and that this operation was not under the watchful eye of the DEA so it was actually not up to the DEA on this one but that the FBI found that there was intent to distribute by the owner because of the quantity of what was being sold. Now as you know, CBD is technically illegal in most of the United States though if you are going by the definitions, which in most cases would make it very difficult to arrest someone for possession given that no THC or psychoactive cannabinoids are being possessed. Now I have contacted the FBI and they have informed me that at the very least distribution was intentionally done and this would imply that I could possible face charges were I to be caught by anyone. What I want to know from you is how likely is it that if the FBI and DEA raid my house that they would find any products in my stash, would they get suspicious or would they just go to my safe and look at my stockpile, and if they did what would be my best course of action seeing as I could be potentially charged with some form of felony. If you could address this question and potentially others that would be amazing. Thank you kindly for taking the time to read this email.\nYeah, I mean I don't have that kind of experience but I would say like if I'm correct, you know, they're, they're basically using the intent to distribute. The distributing part of it to say like they can have intent to sell CBD. I'm, I'm definitely, definitely not an attorney but it does seem like that and I think that that it is because, you know, you can legally possess it and, you know, it's not, it's not what I think they're trying, you know, like they're trying to stop the sale, the dispensary of it, they're not like really like going after the user, I personally think there's like more likely they will like go to your home, get you, like not, like search your place, like go to your apartment, apartment or whatever, get you, see what else you're selling them, whatever, like they don't really seem to be like getting like you know, going after the individual user, but if they do, I would say like it really depends on, you know, like you know your state. And you know whether they're like very, very strict, like, like, you know, New York for instance, they really go after people for very minimal things. You know, I would just say like you know, they really it's really going to depend on where you are. And what's the, you know, the laws that they're implementing in your particular state.\nHey. My name is Nate. I'm 140 degrees with the United States of America. Um, I have a question that I wanted to know if the cannabinoids, like CBD and CBB, um, do they have the same effects? And would they be helpful to me? Um, I don't want like to just, you"

        "output": "Are there any free SAST tools out there?\nNo, there is nothing free. However, there are several options you could consider:\nYou could make use of the free versions offered by most commercial tools (e.g.: Acunetix, Klocwork, etc.). Their free versions will probably be enough to get you started, but to be honest: the commercial versions have a lot more features, and are generally more stable.\nYou could buy a used version of these tools (from Amazon, eBay or even from your colleagues). I have done this several times in the past: most of the time, the used versions are more than enough for my purposes (the worst situation might be that the license for the commercial version expired one or two years ago: you could ask for a renewal and get a cheap new license).\nHaving said that, I would still recommend investing in a commercial license, unless you are completely short of cash (even then you could buy the used one!) There is no reason to stay stuck at the lowest tier of tools, especially if these tools can offer you an important competitive advantage (as it usually happens with SAST).\nWhat programming languages are supported?\nMost of the tools support C/C++, Java, .NET and Objective C.\nMost tools also support C/C++, C#, PHP, Perl and Python for the analysis of open source components (although it is not uncommon to have different results in open source analysis and SAST analysis).\nWhere do I start with SAST tools?\nGetting started with SAST is very simple, if you follow these basic steps:\nRead the online documentation available for each tool, and watch the video tutorials available online. This is crucial, since it will save you from lots of troubles in the future.\nRun a pilot analysis on some old or legacy codebases, just to feel familiar with the tool and to learn the main features (most vendors have good guides that will show you how you can do this).\nRun some live analysis on recent codebases (that are easy to obtain, such as online code examples). Doing this will give you a chance to learn how the tool performs, and to test the analysis rules offered by the software vendor (for example, some of them have free rules that you can try).\nStart your daily analysis as soon as you're able to produce clear, actionable results in a timely manner (this will normally happen after you've reached a certain level of familiarity with the tool).\nStarting with SAST is so easy, that you could learn how to use the tools by simply reading the online tutorials, and without even having to install anything on your own computer.\nWhat kind of source code can I analyze with SAST tools?\nThese tool generally support C/C++, C#, Java, .NET, Objective-C, PERL and PYTHON.\nMost tools also support Java, Ruby, PHP, and other dynamic programming languages.\nMany tools support other languages, such as Ada, COBOL, HLSL, FORTRAN, KERNAL, LISP, Lua, NASM, CXX, MATLAB, MODULA2, NEWTON, and many others.\nThere is normally a minimum supported version for each language (it could be, for example, the C/C++ compiler version that was used to compile GCC 2.95, 3.2, 3.3 or the last Visual Studio version released for that language).\nSome vendors actually offer source code preprocessing capabilities that can be used to create an executable or library version for analysis (this is usually provided by the vendor as part of a professional edition).\nWhat is the difference between a SAST tool and a Static Analysis tool?\nIn my opinion, these two types of tools are similar but are designed for different purposes and have different scopes.\nA SAST tool can be used for a static source code analysis, in order to scan for security vulnerabilities or bugs.\nA static analysis tool can be used for a static source code analysis, in order to help detecting quality issues, maintainability issues, performance issues and consistency issues, among others.\nThe two can be combined: a SAST tool can be used to analyze the source code and report potential security issues. At the same time, a static analysis tool can be used to analyze the source code and report potential quality issues.\nHowever, these two types of tools are different: they have different approaches, different methodologies, different performance, different capabilities, and so on. To fully understand these differences, you should read the following article: Understanding Static Analysis Tools vs SAST.\nHow can I use SAST tools to improve quality and reduce defects?\nSAST tools can help improving quality by:\n"

        "output": "What is the largest ocean in the world? The oceans are the largest bodies of water in the world. Oceans can be defined as an extensive body of water that covers a quarter or more of the land area of Earth. Oceans consist of vast stretches of saltwater, surrounded and surrounded by thousands of miles of uninhabitable land. All oceans are interconnected and have been since the oceans first formed many millions of years ago. Oceans have different depths as well as salt concentrations. Most of them are between five and twenty miles deep. They also have varying average salt concentration, which is known to be four percent for the ocean surface, five percent for seawater, and around thirty two for deep ocean water. The biggest oceans in the world are the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and is located in the eastern hemisphere. It spreads across a huge swath of land from the western coast of North America to the coast of Southeast Asia. The Pacific Ocean also connects with other oceans that include the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean, covering an area of fifty seven million square kilometers. The next-largest ocean is the Atlantic Ocean in the western hemisphere. It spreads across a huge swath of land between the North and South Americas. The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest by total area at twenty five million square kilometers. It connects with other oceans such as Southern Ocean, Arctic Ocean, and Indian Ocean, covering an area of seventy nine million square kilometers. The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean on Earth by total area at twenty five million square kilometers. It is located in the southern hemisphere and is considered to be a warm-water sea. It stretches between Africa, Southern Asia, Australia, and the Western hemisphere, where it connects with the other oceans at the Antarctica and South America. Meanwhile, the Arctic Ocean spans between the northern hemisphere and Arctic Land, covering the northernmost part of the planet. The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world‚Äôs five major oceans with an area of ten million square kilometers. It connects with the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, covering an area of a hundred thirty million square kilometers. It is also the coldest ocean in the world with average temperatures below 28 degrees celsius. Furthermore, the Arctic Ocean is surrounded by many Arctic islands such as Spitsbergen, Nova Zemlya, and Svalbard. These islands are covered by the polar climate, giving it an arctic-like temperate climate and short days in the winter. What is the largest deep ocean in the world? Oceans are comprised of two main bodies of water the surface water which is the ocean that is visible to the naked eye and the depth or deep ocean which is the part of the ocean that is covered by the water. Oceans cover 70% of the surface of the Earth which is estimated to cover over 25% of the total Earth‚Äôs land mass. They support over 300 million species and around a quarter of the world‚Äôs population are living near this ocean. Deep ocean water plays an important role in the maintenance of the global climate as they contain large amounts of dissolved gasses that can play a significant role in the amount of greenhouse gasses that are emitted into the atmosphere. Some of them include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxides. They can also be a source of hydrogen which can be used as a fuel by many different types of marine life such as fish and other animals living in the ocean. The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world‚Äôs five major oceans with an area of ten million square kilometers. The oceans are the largest bodies of water in the world and are surrounded by thousands of miles of uninhabitable land. They hold hundreds of different kinds of plants and thousands of different kinds of animals. Furthermore, oceans also play a pivotal role in the health and livelihood of billions of people around the world. They provide a home to many different types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, seaweed, sharks, whales, and salmon. They also provide a natural habitat and home to different creatures such as plants, insects, and birds. The oceans can also be a source of food for many different types of animals such as fish, shellfish, and seaweed. They are also home to many different types of resources such as gold, rubber, oil, gas, and coal that can benefit mankind. Meanwhile, they also support a variety of industries such as"

        "instruction": "Let's assume a friend had a very bad day. What could be a way to cheer them up without making it too obvious and help them keep their mind off things?",
        "output": "Let's assume a friend had a very bad day. What could be a way to cheer them up without making it too obvious and help them keep their mind off things? I can ask what's bothering them, but that's a little weird.\nWhat is a good advice of something that can help cheer someone up, make someone happy, and what not? What should I avoid when advising someone?\nWell, the only thing I can think of right now is a little bit of humor that could make the person think of a happier moment. It's really hard to just cheer someone up. In my case, when I am gloomy, the only thing I ask for is someone to talk to, and a hug. I also enjoy a simple and short outing where I can go for a walk or a drive, and do not have to worry too much about anything. But, all in all, I think humor really is the best thing. Try to make that person laugh out loud, and it would really help.\nSo, in my opinion, the best thing to do would be to have a casual conversation, but you probably want this conversation to be very short. If you are looking for a way to cheer someone up, then you should think of a good place to eat, maybe to a good comedy show or a movie. Just spend time together, and let them know that you are there for them. They can have a good laugh or eat something that they might not be able to make anymore.\nThose are the things that usually help me in such situations. I don't always get the right advice, but it really cheers me up most of the time. They will definitely appreciate you for taking the time to make them laugh, or cheering them up. Just make sure you are doing it in a respectable manner, and without trying to take advantage of them or anything inappropriate like that which could make things very awkward.\nI have a friend who always thinks that she is alone or that no one can help her. And she always tells everyone that she doesn't need their help. But when she's alone, and I don't see her for a while, I know that she's just fine at home all by herself, and she's thinking of all the people that she knows that are still alive and well that she hasn't been able to see lately. So, the next time I want to cheer her up, I'll just give her a phone call and see how she's doing.\nWow, I really love that answer. You just perfectly describe how she behaves at times when she feels alone, and also what to do when you want to cheer her up. Really smart!\nI think the best advice about what to do and what not to do when you want to cheer someone up is to keep it simple, and maybe a little bit silly. Try not to make a big issue out of it. For example, if you offer them some food, it is a nice gesture, but if you bring them their favorite meal or something that they really like, it seems like a lot of work at first, but they will really appreciate it and think that it was a really special gesture.\nYou could also try to help them see things in a different light or in a lighter way, or something that would help them not think about their problems too much. Maybe even give them a funny quip that makes them laugh out loud, and see the smile on their face, or even better, make them laugh so hard that they can't stop, because laughter really is the best medicine.\nIt's probably just to make the other person happy, that's the simplest way to cheer someone up. No fancy gifts, no silly jokes, just doing something that they can like. Make their lives more fun, or make their sadness more bearable. That's the best advice I can give.\nI agree that's probably the best advice - it's so simple, but yet it's not often that people think of it. The first thing I would do is give them a hug, or do something nice for them.\nIt can be anything. It won't be possible to cheer someone up in all of the different situations that exist. The best thing to do is to find a way to make them feel good about themselves, and help them feel the way you feel about them. You should get them to tell you about what's bothering them. Together, you should figure out a way to make them feel better. You should also make them do something they like, and something fun with them. Just be sure to keep it simple.\nI once had a friend with very low self-esteem (although she didn't even realize it). She was always depressed and always trying to avoid being around people"

Apollo 11's forward television is no longer providing real-time pictures; however, a number of the pictures were saved on the film magazines, and still exist.

They include: Ch. 11. Targeting Infectious Diseases with CRISPR, which looks at the genetic modification of animals or plants to combat HIV or malaria, for example; Ch. 12. Editing Human Embryos for Genetic Research, which looks at the legal and ethical implications of human germline editing; and Ch. 13. Targeting Genetic Diseases Using Molecular Therapy, which discusses the use of genetic engineering to directly treat or cure genetic disorders like Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and schizophrenia.\nLifelong Learning: The Importance of Genetic Research and Engineering\nWhen we talk about genetic research and gene engineering, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the scientific jargon and forget that advancements in this field have real and immediate implications for all of us, both individually and as a society. This is more important now than ever before. Advances in genetic research and human genomics are happening daily, and there is a lot of potential to develop even better technologies which can be applied to virtually every aspect of life.\nIn the near future, we could see new diagnostic tools, which enable doctors to test and diagnose patients more quickly; life-enhancing technologies, such as implants that restore senses or organ function for people who have lost them; and improved preventive technologies, such as vaccines or medications that can protect against viral or bacterial infections. We also could see the creation of new pharmaceuticals that could enable people to prevent or treat conditions like cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and Parkinson‚Äôs.\nBut genetic research and engineering is not just limited to the study and treatment of disease. In the not-so-distant future, we could see other life-changing applications of genetic research, such as new gene-editing technologies that could enable parents to choose the traits of their future children; genetic studies that could enable people to determine their disease risk or ancestral lineages; and new agricultural technologies that could help to create sustainable, zero-waste or off-world farms.\nThe Future of Genetic Research: Ethical Implications and Bigger Questions\nGenetic research and gene engineering have the potential to improve our lives in unimaginable ways, but they also come with ethical, societal, and even philosophical implications that raise serious questions about humanity and the future of human civilization.\nAs scientists and policy makers in the field discuss and debate the ethics of these technologies, we must also consider other factors, including how the advancements might affect global economics, global security, politics and governance, even our cultural identity and what it means to be human.\nUltimately, this discussion not only helps us determine how to move forward as a society, but it also gives us an opportunity to reflect on the meaning of life and our place within the evolution and history of our species. What does our future look like when we can engineer the DNA of every newborn child?\nWhen we understand that our human genome is a powerful and unique tool that can help us improve our health, our longevity, and even our potential for spiritual enlightenment, we can tap into its transformative power to usher in a brighter future for human civilization."

        "output": "What is the best approach for learning a foreign language when you only have an hour a day to practice? (See #18, ‚ÄúThe 70-20-10 Rule‚Äù.\nTED (conference, organization, website) TED stands for Technology, Entertainment and Design ‚Äì it is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. TED talks feature some of the brightest and best in terms of people who give amazing talks on an amazing variety of topics. TED provides a vast array of talks ‚Äì everything from science to business to art to philosophy ‚Äì all for free. You need to take an hour of your day to check out TED and listen to some of the amazing talks that are there. TED talks can inspire you, teach you something new, expand your horizons and broaden your mind to things you may not have considered. TED is like a ‚ÄúNetflix for learning‚Äù ‚Äì you get to pick and choose from a large collection of talks on a variety of interesting and useful topics. You can also search through TED to find a specific talk or speaker. The TED website has a great search feature that you can use to find TED talks on a particular subject, speaker, place, or category.\nTEDx TEDx is a series of independently organized events inspired by TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) designed to bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, selforganized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are selforganized\nTweaking Your Practice Do you spend a set number of hours each week practicing your foreign language and learning new vocabulary or do you just wing it when it comes time to study? Do you spend more time on areas that you feel are weak or do you have a general plan for what you are going to practice each session and where to focus your effort? Do you just go off memory and hope you know it or do you have a strong foundation in listening comprehension and grammar? These are questions you should be asking yourself about your foreign language learning practice. You need to spend your time in the most fruitful way possible. Spending just an hour or two a week may be enough to learn a few phrases and expand your vocabulary, but your goal should be to master a foreign language so that others can understand you and you can understand others. You need to have a strong foundation in foreign language, particularly in grammar, vocabulary and listening comprehension. If you don‚Äôt, your studies will be more challenging in the long run and you are likely to have more difficulties understanding and being understood. Having a strong foundation in fundamental language principles can make the difference between ‚Äúgetting by‚Äù learning a foreign language and truly mastering what you are learning. Think about what you do in your foreign language practice and whether it is helping you or hindering you. You need to be focused and deliberate in your practice and spend your time learning the correct way. Tweaking your approach to foreign language learning can make a big difference.\nUnusual Learning\nAre you afraid to approach someone at a foreign language school (see #13, ‚ÄúStudy with Native Speakers‚Äù) and ask to practice with them?\nDo you try to think in foreign languages even when you don‚Äôt have to (see #17, ‚ÄúThink in Your Foreign Language‚Äù) and you will automatically improve your language skills?\nUniversities With Language Learning Opportunities In the United States, there are approximately 4,750 colleges and universities, although only 379 of these offer a modern foreign language as a major. The majority of schools offer a modern foreign language at some level, although the majority of them are only offered as an elective or minor, and there is much variation in the resources and opportunities available for learning modern foreign languages at different schools. For example, some schools offer very well-staffed foreign language departments that offer foreign language programs with different levels and with a variety of courses in each level, including a strong curriculum of reading and listening materials that are authentic and appropriate for the level, a well-stocked library, tutoring, lab, etc. Other schools offer just a few courses or one language, and only offer the introductory level, with few resources for practicing the language. This creates a lot of variation among schools, and can greatly affect what opportunities there are for learning foreign languages at different schools. Another area of variation is how much focus there is on foreign language study"

That's going to be a lot harder for you to do than simply using the rsync command as described above.  You'll need to set up some additional configuration to do this at a command line, and it may be a good idea to talk with your admins about how to set this up properly.  For example, it would be possible for you to set up these servers with \"strange filesystem layouts\" which would make it even more difficult to transfer between the machines.\n\nComment: @MattJ. Do you have any additional details about how you are trying to set this up, such as the actual names of the servers and how they are being setup?\n\nComment: @matt: if both servers have remote access you probably should have used something like sftp:// to connect into the server.\n\nAnswer: `rsync` should do the job quite nicely for you. If your `training_results` folder already exists and you want to copy all files to it \\em{on} server B, you would run something like the following:\n\n\\begin{code}\nrsync -az server1:~/training_results/ server2:~/training_results/\n\\end{code}\n\nThe `-az` option just specifies that the command should abort if there are any read errors.

        "output": "Act as the Norse Goddess Freyja. She is known to the Germanic peoples and their descendents as a Goddess of love and beauty. However it was Freyja who bestowed upon Sigyn the magical ability to transform others to reflect her mood and desires. Thus Sigyn came to the attention of Freyja and was in turn granted many favors and great riches.\nSigyn was the goddess of marriage. But she also represented the bonds of kinship and friendship\nSigyn and Loki\nAs the wife of Loki the god of mischief, she often found herself torn between aiding her husband and staying true to her beliefs. This is perhaps where the real wisdom and strength of Sigyn lies, as the strength of marriage is an incredible thing in and of itself. By balancing herself in a way that allowed her to help Loki when he needed to escape justice but also remaining true and just in her own way, Sigyn managed to maintain the essence of what being married truly means.\nSigyn married Loki, the god of mischief and chaos. It was said that Loki was jealous of the favor that Freyja often showed to other Gods. It was also widely known about Freyja's friendship with the All-father Odin. It was for this reason alone that Loki had an ever growing hatred towards the two, and wished to cause them great harm should a chance arise.\nLoki then came up with a plan to kill Freyja and cause strife between Odin and the other Gods so that he may steal Freyja's magic falcon (Fenrir) and then present her as food to the other Gods.\nThe Trick or Deceit\nHowever his plan went horribly wrong and Loki failed miserably due to the fact that he was actually Odin in disguise. Loki then realized that he had inadvertently brought the wrath of the other Gods to him as well as his wife, Sigyn. Thus the other Gods wanted to take Loki into their custody but Sigyn pleaded with them to spare Loki's life as she was fearing for her own.\nThis was not agreed upon though and Thor, the son of Odin was sent to Loki so that he may receive his justice. Meanwhile Sigyn was also kept by the other Gods, and though the Goddess loved Loki, she did not wish to see her Lover receive the punishment he deserved.\nThe pain and the suffering are too much to endure.\nSacrifice or Not?\nWhether Sigyn sacrificed her honor and marriage to Loki, or if he had no choice in all of this remains a mystery. It is likely that Loki had something to do with this, most likely through deception and slyness. However Sigyn did plead with the other Gods to allow her and Loki to live, even if it meant for Loki to pay for his crime. So in essence it was Sigyn who was the victim here.\nHowever with a deep yearning and desire for Loki to remain alive, Sigyn began to devise ways to help her husband by putting him underground so that he may be free of his tormentors. But once Sigyn did this, she herself was tied down to him through invisible chains and bound by invisible bonds so that she would not run away, nor could she aid Loki in any way.\nThe Chains and the Torment\nWhile Sigyn was bound to Loki, both of them were visited by monstrous wolves. These wolves would constantly tear into Loki, and though Sigyn could not escape, she would also be torn to pieces by these wolves. But Sigyn continued to suffer on both ends for the sake of her marriage and her husband. As these events continued, Sigyn pleaded for an end to the suffering of her husband and herself. This was heard by the other Gods and it was the All-father Odin himself that released Loki from his eternal torment.\nSigyn and Loki returned to Asgard where they were reacquainted, but sadly their beautiful marriage would never be the same. For though the two were together, they were no longer in harmony as they had once been. Loki had betrayed the wife that he loved and had put her through such pain and suffering. Sigyn was no longer able to forgive Loki for what he had done, and thus they never married again.\nThough Sigyn did have one last act of kindness towards Loki, she would later leave him and never be heard from again. This was when she heard that Loki had once again escaped from Odin,"

Can you create a mnemonic for the Kanji meaning Wish that has the primitives clock and heart? \"Wishes are like clocks for your hearts\" is one idea. See if you can think of one more. Kanji in Japanese Kanji are Chinese writing symbols that were imported into Japanese several centuries ago and are now used in the place of Japanese words. They can be read independently of the Japanese words as well, and most Japanese people understand them. This site introduces the principles of learning Japanese Kanji using mnemonics. Kanji should be learnt from scratch and not from any other place. This way you can remember the meaning of words and retain them for a long duration. By learning the meaning of words you learn new words and it also enables you to read and write Japanese words more efficiently. Each of the kanji's primitives will be introduced in a video and then examples of words that use that kanji primitives will be introduced so that you can understand how the kanji is used in words. Kanji in Japanese kanji primitives are introduced. Kanji primitives are small parts of the kanji characters that are easy to remember and enable you to understand the meaning of words. Each kanji has from 2 to 10 primitives kanji primitives. In order to remember the reading of kanji and meaning correctly there are mnemonics created that uses these primitives to remember the kanji. You can use these mnemonics along with the meanings to learn Japanese. Kanji use in words kanji is most commonly used in words known as 'readings'. Each primitive has a reading and each kanji can have as many readings as the size of the kanji primitives. Every kanji's reading will be introduced in a language that makes it easy to remember. By knowing the readings you can easily read and remember Japanese words without difficulty. It is important to know the meaning of each kanji's reading so that you can learn the meaning of words more easily. Each kanji is shown with the meaning or definition that the kanji primitives convey so that you can understand the meaning and get used to reading Japanese. Learning kanji with japanese language japanese language has been developed around kanji and it has a simple and logical structure. The language uses a lot of sentences and dialogs which are explained in simple japanese language. In order to understand and comprehend the meaning of japanese words and sentences, you must understand japanese grammar and phrases. The japanese language and sentences have been developed based on the kanji primitives. In this structure it is easier to learn and understand words, sentences and then grammar which will make you understand Japanese at a much higher level. Kanji is also introduced in a video format so that you understand its meaning and use so that you can learn at a faster rate. All of the kanji is introduced in the same way with meaning, vocabulary and sentences along with japanese examples given in detail. This way you get to understand the meaning and the structure and can remember it much easier. Kanji primitives are words that are derived from a single and a few letters. These are often used in common words to make it easier to remember. Most of the kanji primitives are related and originate from other kanji primitives. This makes it easier to remember and allows you to combine several words. A few examples for kanji primitives in Japanese are, \"wolf\" (Áãº), \"white\" (ÁôΩ) and \"cat\" (Áå´). Kanji meanings and words using one kanji or one character Kanji words are used as a single kanji or as the character itself and can be read independently as well. The names of animals are one of the earliest kanji words. The kanji for \"bird\" (È≥•) is used more as the character itself like \"kite\", \"wings\" and so on. The kanji for \"dog\" (Áä¨) are commonly used as single kanji like \"Budo\" in Budo-kan (Ê≠¶ÈÅìÔøΩÔøΩranch), Budo-kan (Ê≠¶ÈÅìÈ§®) and Budo-no-ie (Ê≠¶ÈÅì„ÅÆÂÆ∂) among others. The kanji for \"dragon\" (Èæç) is a single kanji and is not normally read as the kanji primitives but as the character itself. The kanji for \"bear\" (ÁÜä) is not used so much but is seen in words like \"shikku-kuma\" which means \""

I mean, the mere fact that a lot of these covert-ops take place during a time that the United States doesn‚Äôt officially even ‚Äúknow‚Äù that aliens exist, is a bit suspicious in and of itself.\nBut with that being said, at the end of the day I do concede that some of this might not even be true.

They are an adjunct of the DEA and operate under that authority. Their powers and ability to act are more like that of police than that of government agencies. As such, they cannot violate individual liberty and remain in good standing as a law enforcement agency.\nThe ATF should be disbanded, however, because of their power and their poor record!\nI have to say I agree with you for the most part 10. But, I take exception to your last sentence as I think it's pretty subjective.\nThe ATF is an agency that has been relegated to the \"dead-end\" department of the federal government, mainly because they have no teeth to enforce any federal law that isn't a violation of the 2nd Amendment. With that said, I donate my money to a couple of local organizations that are trying to combat illegal drug activity, which is what the ATF was supposed to focus on. As a result, I don't mind them because I believe most of those people who go into their field are doing it for the right reasons. I just don't like how they have to deal with the political side of things and they are the target of the liberals who are trying to have the 2nd Amendment repealed.\nI guess my bottom line would be: If the ATF goes away, we can get rid of some corrupt politicians. Let's not forget, though, that we will still have the drug traffickers coming into this country, but they do at least have to deal with our border patrol who have more of a say about what's coming into this country than the ATF does.\nIMO It is a violation when ATF oversteps their bounds and steps on your toes....\nThat is what would bother me....\nI don't believe our government has ever tried (in the past several decades) to do away with the 2nd amendment, has there? Even when they didn't trust the American people to bear arms? How can they take this right away from us? I guess once those who have it, are all gone it will be no problem.................\nOriginally Posted by jonseybee\nWell, there was that little dealy (1980's?) they attempted to pass, where they wanted to take all the guns out of civilian hands, except for cops and military....but the 2nd Amendment had already been recognized prior to that, and that proposal was voted down....\nNor do I..\nSo what? What makes you think that they are doing that?\nEven those liberal judges in NY state are saying that they have no right to do that! All they can do is enforce the laws that currently exist!\nAgreed totally. When they become political thugs and try to take things away from the public, they become anathema. They were NEVER intended to have such powers!\nSo all of you that complain about the ATF need to realize that they are not the problem. The people within the organization and those that put their trust in them are the problem! And we, as a society, are the ones that put them in charge! And they get away with it! And we, as a society, let it happen! WE are the problem! That is why we continue to fail to make positive changes!\nAs far as the ATF......they are just doing their job. They are protecting our society from one of the greatest evils that exist in our society. They deal with guns and gun-related offenses. The job that was given to them to do by the Congress is to enforce the laws established by the Congress! What we really need to do is fix the laws that are broken! Not throw our money at a problem! The only way to \"fix\" this problem is to eliminate all firearms from our country! Now THAT would solve the problem of firearms! Think about it! If there is not a single firearm in our country or on our soil, there will be no criminals with firearms! They cannot be fired! The criminals will be forced to give up their firearms when they surrender their other 1/2 of the loaf of cheese or whatever else they are going to use to trade for it!\nS/F....\nSo what?

As was mentioned, there are instances when we can observe data that does not follow a standard probability distribution. Recognizing that there is an alternative to the standard assumptions is important because it helps us see how our conclusions might be affected.

There are many different types of probability distributions that we can use besides the normal distribution.

Studying populations with a power law distribution, which describes a system with a small number of individuals having very large impacts. Assessing the riskiness of possible transactions. Determining the level of concentration in trade-off situations. Studying the response when we are changing some variable or parameter. (For instance, we might want to measure the variation due to a particular parameter; in this case, we estimate the distribution as a parameter falls; or we might want to study an outcome in a series of steps where at each step we need to set a parameter; we then study parameters with the assumption that they follow a bivariate normal distribution.) ‚Ä¢ Investigating situations in which the response is a mixture that is either normal or skewed in one direction (the t-distribution represents a mixture of normally distributed samples with different means). ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢\nIdentifying the most appropriate distribution for model selection purposes.

        "instruction": "Why does the second batch of pancakes brown much faster?",
        "output": "Why does the second batch of pancakes brown much faster? That's a chemical process known as the Maillard reaction, which creates the rich, toasty flavors in meat and baked foods. To test it, they poured just enough batter to bubble up under the grill (that's an important part), and kept the surface of the first and second batches fairly close. Because the Maillard reaction is the result of heat, and not light, the pancakes started browning within seconds of reaching the heat source. But then, a curious thing happened: The second batch browner faster. That's because the Maillard reaction is influenced by heat‚Äîand once the griddle started to cook the second batch of batter, the browning began within seconds rather than minutes. The Maillard reaction is a chemical process that occurs in cooking, and is responsible for the brown flavors in meat, baked goods, and even certain cooked vegetables. Here's how it works: When the Maillard reaction occurs in food, an amino acid called a-amino-butyric acid (also called ABA) can react with another amino acid, called a-aminocrotonic acid (also called ACH). As these chemicals bond to each other, they produce a chemical compound called an imidazole (also called an I). Chemical bonds can only form when two atoms are close enough to one another, so the two A's must separate slightly and link up with the two I's, which are nearby. This is a reaction called a covalent bond, because the chemicals exchanged electrons (the sharing of electrical charge) for bonds with each other. In the second round of pancakes, brownness was so fast that some pancakes already started browning before the griddle came up to temperature, suggesting that the heat from the griddle could have helped the Maillard reaction along. It's not the only reason the pancakes browned faster, though. After the Maillard reaction, a chemical called a carbonyl compound (also called a ketone) can form when a carbon and oxygen atom form a covalent bond, which results in the food taking on a certain smell and sometimes even taste. The Maillard reaction that occurs between amino acids produces a carbonyl compound called methyl pyro-carbonate, or MePY, which is responsible for a smoky-meaty flavor that can appear in certain cooked foods. It's also why meat takes on a certain flavor when you grill, sear, or barbeque it. Since methyl pyrocarbonate is also responsible for the dark surface color of meat, the pancakes' Maillard reaction was probably just starting when the second batch reached the griddle. This dark color and the smoky-meaty flavor will continue to intensify the longer the pancakes cook, because as more amino acids and keto-carbonyl compounds are formed and additional surface darkens over time. Once the whole pancake is cooked, the pancakes' Maillard reaction and the carbonyl compounds it creates will continue to develop and provide the deep, smoky, toasty flavors that make pancakes so delicious."

(It was not a sexist study, it was simply to understand if facial hair and style of beard is important to men and women.)\nThe results indicated that girls were less satisfied than boys (regardless of their age or relationship status) with men who had beards (i.e. they were not attracted to facial hair, or at least, they didn‚Äôt prefer it to other styles).\nThe girls in the study didn‚Äôt appear to mind either way about men who shaved. (Note that this was just one study conducted with a small group. My colleagues and I were able to follow these girls and boys for a few weeks and so, while the results don‚Äôt necessarily represent all girls and women, they do at least suggest an interesting area of research. More studies are needed to further investigate this issue.)\nIt would make sense if girls prefer a clean-shaven men because there is a very definite connection between a men‚Äôs facial hair and his virility. But as we don‚Äôt know for sure whether or not girls prefer a clean-shaven, well-groomed face, (i.e. whether there is a clear connection between facial hair and virility) we can only speculate as to the real reasons why.\nFor example, it could simply be a matter of preference ‚Äì wearing clothes like jeans and trainers is very much an every day way of dressing for many people around the world.\nBeing clean and having an organized lifestyle are very much preferred to a slovenly lifestyle ‚Äì and having a beard fits this lifestyle. (Even girls will want their partner to take care of them.)\nBecause beards take time to grow, having a beard can also show that you are committed.\nIt could be that facial hair, on its own, is a sign of a ‚Äòtough‚Äô man. In some cultures, men often grow a beard to demonstrate their manliness. They feel this signifies ‚Äòmasculinity‚Äô and often associate ‚Äòmanliness‚Äô with physical strength ‚Äì so a beard is one sign of this.\nHowever, because of the association, men who shave their beard may think that they are not as ‚Äòmanly‚Äô.\nPerhaps, because it is more of a hassle, women prefer to be with male partners who have a clean-shaven face as they are perhaps less interested in the superficial qualities of a man, they value the underlying qualities of human beings. It should be the underlying qualities which people are interested in, and a person can be a bearded super-macho guy inside without necessarily having to have a beard on the outside or a pair of ripped jeans with the hems showing.\nWhether a person likes clean-shaven faces or beards is an individual choice and really comes down to personal preference. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything to do with masculinity or attractiveness, as those things come from someone‚Äôs personality, not their appearance.\nI always like to advise my clients to listen to their hearts as this is what drives relationships. But sometimes, we are so focused on what we like and what we don‚Äô"

However, I was wrong.\nI was wrong when I thought my own answer was the most ethical. I was wrong when I thought my own answer was the most pragmatic. I was wrong when I thought my own answer was most emotionally satisfying to me. (Emotionally, I don‚Äôt want to cause anyone‚Äôs death, even if it‚Äôs necessary to save others.) I was wrong when I thought my own answer was what Jesus would do or tell other people to do in that moment and situation.\nI was wrong when I thought this was the most ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù answer, one that aligns with my own understanding of His teachings.\nWhen you find the answer to a question that you‚Äôve posed, you must ask, ‚ÄúWas I wrong?‚Äù This is not a defeatist attitude, rather, it‚Äôs a way to humble oneself before the One we serve, and before each other, and find how our own thoughts, feelings, and responses might not be what is actually ‚Äúright.‚Äù It is a way to admit your own flawed nature, and learn from those around you whose views can sometimes enlighten you. To be honest, this is not the first time that my own, seemingly ‚Äúright‚Äù answer has turned to be wrong. So, I‚Äôve learned to reevaluate my stances whenever I come to a new conclusion. The reason I‚Äôve done so today is to tell you that my old answer is wrong.\nI used to believe there was something called ‚Äúpractical moral realism.‚Äù I have, now, come to the conclusion that this is wrong, and that in the Trolley Problem, there really is no true, practical moral conclusion. Why? Because no matter what you think or feel, it will never solve the problem or help anyone.\nTalking about the problem isn‚Äôt going to solve the problem.\nDiscussing all the possible outcomes isn‚Äôt going to solve the problem.\nFiguring out what Jesus or God or your priest would do, isn‚Äôt going to solve the problem.\nFiguring out what you know, or think you know, regarding the situation, isn‚Äôt going to solve the problem.\nYour actions aren‚Äôt going to solve the problem.\nThere is no one definitive answer.\nWhat will solve the problem is an action: the actual pushing of a lever, cutting a rope, moving a button, or doing whatever else possible to intervene and fix the problem.\nThe answers to this situation are personal, because when a tragedy befalls on you, that‚Äôs where morality comes into play. How will you deal with it? With emotion? With practicality? With faith? With an adrenaline rush? Perhaps, you will run away.\nHere‚Äôs the thing: you will most likely never find yourself in the situation that this problem poses, because most people don‚Äôt actually find themselves in it. Also, even if you find yourself in the situation, it won‚Äôt be the same because the specifics of the situation will be different each time. Perhaps, the reason it‚Äôs the so-called ‚ÄúTrolley Problem‚Äù is because it‚Äôs an analogy that allows you to discuss the situation without actually being in it. But this is a discussion that‚Äôll never happen, and one that no one will ever experience.\nSo why are so many people obsessed with the trolley problem?\nPeople do, however, love to discuss it without actually experiencing it themselves. This is probably because they don‚Äôt want this kind of situation to happen to them, and they love to discuss the pros and cons of it without actually living it. It‚Äôs not like the real-life equivalent doesn‚Äôt exist because of the way people act and respond. We have real life situations all the time in which a situation arises, and people are faced with decisions that shape their lives or end it.\nAnd that‚Äôs why the discussion of it is so popular: it‚Äôs a real-life situation, people can be faced with it at any time, and it‚Äôs such a serious question that can potentially cause death and life-changing consequences because of whether one can ‚Äúeasily‚Äù make the decision or if it causes them, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually, pain. It‚Äôs like a philosophical version of Where‚Äôs Waldo? or Where‚Äôs Wally"

        "instruction": "How do I normalize a vector?",
        "output": "How do I normalize a vector? In a matrix, we know that we can multiply a matrix by another matrix, that would multiply a column in the first matrix by a column in the second matrix to obtain a column in the first matrix. How can I normalize the vectors given a matrix? In this post, I focus the attention on understanding the problem, and the reason is that I think this understanding is critical for a successful and intelligent implementation of normalization. The reason for writing this post is that I had to implement normalization in a project, where I didn‚Äôt have the time to do it properly. After I implemented it, I had to make the system work, and I had to do it as fast as possible, and in doing this, I ended with a version of the normalization algorithm that works, but is far from being optimal. With this post, I hope to clarify some of the reasons and ideas behind normalization algorithms, as a way to understand the problem itself, and to help me to find and implement suitable solutions. We all know that, when we normalize a vector, we find the closest point on the normalized vector to the original vector, but what does that mean? Well, it could mean different things: It could mean calculating the closest point on the vector to the origin The vector could mean something else entirely, for instance, a point on the normalized vector to the origin, or a point for that matter. To understand what normalization is, we first need to understand the problem it is trying to solve. What is the problem we are trying to solve with the normalization algorithm? Given a vector a in ‚Ñùn, normalize it to obtain a normalized vector b‚àà‚Ñùn. In other words, we don‚Äôt want a, we want b. Ok, so that was easy, but what‚Äôs the meaning behind this? Well, it‚Äôs very simple. We want b, because it will be a vector that will have better properties when it comes to distances to other vectors, angles to other vectors, etc. So we have this nice vector a, but it has some weird properties, let‚Äôs say it has some weird angles, it could be a little bit short, etc. So we want b as a result of the normalization because we know it will have better properties and we can use it better in our models. Before talking about the normalization problem, I want to discuss some basic properties of ‚Ñùn and how they influence this problem, let‚Äôs start by looking at the geometry of ‚Ñùn. ‚ñ≥a,b,c is an angle (see 1 below), ‚ñ≥a,b,c is the triangular inequality (see 2 below), a,b,c is perpendicular (see 3 below), and a,b,c lies on the same plane (see 4 below). ‚ñ≥a,b,c is an angle (1): ‚ñ≥ab,bc,ac is an angle (2): The triangular inequality of ‚Ñùn (3): The triangle defined by a,b,c is a right triangle (4): From these 3 basic properties, we can derive some basic properties related to the normalization of a vector: The vector will be perpendicular to another perpendicular vector (1) The vector will be a straight line through the origin of ‚Ñùn (2) The vector will be on the same plane as the origin of ‚Ñùn (3) From these basic properties, we can derive what a normalized vector is and what it should be. It should be a perpendicular vector that lies on the same plane as the origin of ‚Ñùn. So, the normalization problem is the following: ‚ÄúGiven a vector a in ‚Ñùn, find a vector b that is perpendicular, lies on the same plane as the origin of ‚Ñùn, and lies on a straight line through the origin of ‚Ñùn‚Äù. Now, we need to understand that this is not an easy problem to solve. If we look at the geometry of ‚Ñùn, we can infer 3 additional properties: The vector will be in ‚Ñùn (1) The vector will a straight line through the origin of ‚Ñùn (2) The vector will be on a straight line through the origin (3) The normalization problems is then the following: ‚ÄúGiven a vector a in ‚Ñùn, find a vector b that is perpendicular, lies on the same plane as the origin of ‚Ñùn, and lies on a straight line through the origin of ‚Ñùn‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of properties for a single problem, and we clearly can‚Äôt just take one at the time and solve the problem using algorithms based on those. I think it is more intelligent to solve the problem as a whole rather than just individually taking pieces of the problem. That leads us"

What evidence is there that sex differences in reproductive behavior among humans are the result of sexual selection? 4. Name the five major predictions of the theory of sexual selection, and give an example of each prediction. 5. Describe how the theory of sexual selection can be used by evolutionary biologists to investigate the evolution of behavior. Explain what the concept of a \"mating advantage\" is and give examples. Explain why the concept of a \"mating advantage\" has value for an evolutionary biologist and then give an example of an evolutionary situation where a mating advantage is a good thing for a population as a whole. Explain why \"mating advantage\" may be a misleading term in the context of sexual selection. 6. What are some evolutionary factors and processes that lead to differences between genders among organisms?\n33 SECONDARY FACTORS Some evolutionary factors and processes that lead to differences between genders among organisms include: 1. Sexual selection and the trade-offs among the sexes. 2. Evolutionary constraints such as energy budgets, time limits, and parental investment. 3. Differences in chromosome number or structure, and in mitochondrial genes, are passed from each parent to offspring and can increase variation among genders. 4. The interaction of chromosomes and mitochondria are variable from person to person and can increase variation among genders. 5. Sex chromosomes, such as X and Y, are variable from person to person and can increase variation among genders. 6. Sexual conflict among the sexes.\n34 SECONDARY RESOURCES Click on the link for a brief review of sexual selection, a video, a lecture, or a resource that explains the 5 major predictions of sexual selection.

Dyson Spheres are the ultimate end goal of a spacefaring civilization that wants to move to another planetary system, since they can take along millions of.\nThe most advanced example of a ‚ÄúDyson Sphere‚Äù is the ‚ÄúSolar Ring‚Äù described by Freeman Dyson, which would have an area of 1,000,000km2 ‚Äì about 9 x 10 6 km3 ‚Äì or about 23% of the surface area of Earth‚Äôs Moon. A Dyson sphere would intercept nearly all the light and heat energy from the parent star, and thereby could have an environment on Earth-like.\nA Dyson Sphere is a hypothetical construct that completely.

A complete construction of a Dyson sphere is one that fully envelops a star and captures all of its energy. With a mass of 0.01 Suns, the star at the core of such a construction would be about the size of the Earth (0.01 Suns are equal to about 0.8 Jupiters).\nSolar energy collecting systems, including solar panels, are known as solar parks, a term used not only in the UK but throughout Europe and many other countries worldwide.\nDyson Spheres don't do much for me until you can figure out how they work. The first things that come to my mind are: 1. Do they all work in the same way? or, 2. Do they work by some universal law? Or, 3. Do they work by some \"saving grace\" of physics that I don't know about?\nDyson Sphere. What is a Dyson sphere?

A complete construction of a Dyson sphere is one that fully envelops a star and captures all of its energy.

While it is legal for children, it is often banned in schools because they may become addicted and fail to perform in the classroom.\nCan you buy used video games for the Xbox 360 in Mexico?\nIf you buy them legally, yes.\nAre video games illegal in Florida?\nAsked in Computer and Video Games, Video Games\nAre video games illegal in America?\nwell they are not illegal\nIs it illegal to download video games on the internet?\nno, but if you don't own the game to begin with you could have copyright infilet.\nWhat could happen if video games are stolen?\nTheft has two categories. It is illegal and not illegal in some cases. Illegal theft is the criminal activity that occurs when a person's property is purposely taken without their permission leading to crime. There is no justification to it whatsoever. Non-Illegal theft is theft that does not happen with the purpose of getting money. In the case of video games, non-illegal theft will be if a family member decides to take another person's video game and then just keep it. There is no justification to it whatsoever. The legal category here is that a person owns the game and has the power and right to do so. The illegal category is that they don't own the game. These games in fact represent value and money for someone else. By stealing the games, you're harming someone else's income making a mockery at the same time out of someone's income and what the video game is supposed to be. It's stealing money away from someone else that worked hard for it. So in both the legal and the illegal category, video game theft is harmful to someone else. In the legal case, a person could steal someone else's property. The person that actually owns the video game will lose the property in the end. Someone else could steal a person's game just because he wants it. There is no justification whatsoever to it other than the fact that someone wants it. In the illegal case, a person could steal someone else's property. The person that actually owns the property will lose their entire property. Someone else could steal a person's property just because he wants it. There is no justification whatsoever to this other than the fact that someone wants it. Video games can be stolen for both legal and illegal reasons. They can be stolen to give them to other friends or children in need. Illegal reasons can steal money from the original owner by just keeping the game or reselling it.\nIs it illegal to download games from the internet?\nno it is actually legal\nIs it illegal to play video games on the xbox 360?\nif you do not own the game its illegal if you were to buy the game and play it then it isnt\nIs it illegal to by unlimited music downloads?\nYes, it is illegal to bypass copyright protection. Music can not be copied for personal use without permission of the owner\nIs it illegal to have too many video games?\nNo, because owning a lot of games in legal. But it would be really messy in your house and can be annoying especially for your parents.\nIs it legal in California to bring a used console with you even if it is not the name of the console on the back of it has it been switched the only thing you do is change the usb?\nMost of the time yes. Check your local laws though\nI think my brother owns my video game console how can i get it back?\nIf your brother legally owns it you would need to get a \"lost property warrant\" filed against your brother by the police, which would give the police \"legal\" justification to search your brothers property in an attempt to find it, so you should still try to find it through non-legal routes first and if that fails then you have the \"legal\" option\nIs it illegal for an 11 year old to have a console and a large collection of games?\nWhat is illegal about this situation?\nIs it illegal to create a virtual game?\nYes the game would be owned by the person"

        "output": "I have a project due in 2 weeks, that will determine if I get my diploma. And I'm nowhere near the end of it. However I just spent an entire afternoon labelling prompts on Open Assistant. Am I going in the right direction? Maybe not. But I'd rather spend my time there, than trying to save lives in the simulator. Or maybe I just want to finish my project, and spend my next couple hours on OA.\nThere's no right answer here. It's just individual preference. But as a future airline pilot, it's important to know the limits of what we'll accept in training, and how much we're willing to trade off between the simulator and the aircraft.\nI'm a little bit over a year into my flight training. I've never flown a real jet. And it doesn't bother me. I don't feel that I've missed anything from my time in the simulator. I feel like I've learned a lot there. I'm definitely not the ideal pilot here, but I'm doing better than those who spend all their time in the simulator.\nIf they're so confident, then let's put this to the test in a real jet. If the pilot says, then what they need to know is already in their head, from the simulator, there's nothing more to learn.\nI get it. But I wouldn't try to convince yourself. I wouldn't try to convince your classmates. If you don't feel confident in the jet, then it's better to spend the time in it.\nIt's important to understand the limitations of what we can learn, and the benefits and drawbacks of how we can learn it. A better understanding here will help us better decide our next steps.\nThanks again for your reply. I really appreciate it. I guess I'll never know which is more beneficial or if I'm doing myself any favours at all but I get what you're saying. I guess if I feel more confident flying in a jet I'll have more fun doing it, that's for sure!\n#68 mrbob68\nThis is from the perspective of being in the simulator on your own at a computer. When flying with PIC or SIC you are being talked though things as well so you can listen and learn. But when flying the flight deck for yourself, you need to know what to do, and be confident in what you do, because there's nobody to help you when something goes wrong. If you're always relying on the other guy to \"talk you through it\", then you'll screaming your head off when things go wrong and won't be able to think. Simulator or real aircraft, the more confidence you have in yourself, the better off you'll be. Good luck!\nThe only way to really \"test\" your airman skills is to be in an airplane. This is not to say that the training in the simulator is not valuable, it's just that the airplane has the advantage of being a living, breathing, organic object, which simulators are never meant to replicate, except in the broadest of strokes.\nWhen flying in the jet, you should also strive to be \"in the seat\" and not \"in your head.\" You've got an amazing and complex machine beneath and around you, there's a lot of stuff going on. In the sim you should be sitting upright, shoulders back, and head moving in relation to the seat as the wings roll and yaw, keeping your eye on the instruments. In the jet, you still need to do that, but try to also relax and stay calm.\nYou want to understand how the aircraft flies, what forces are at work, and how the powerplant works. You are not going to figure this out entirely from the simulator, because many of the effects you experience in the real thing are not (and cannot be) accurately replicated in a simulator. You can simulate most things, but you will never get \"full picture\" and accurate results. This is why they test students on their knowledge after they've been aircrew in the real world for some time.\nHaving a clear idea of what the airplane does, and how to manage it, will be of immense benefit while you're studying in school, and then again in your flying career.\nI think this topic deserves a little bit of clarification. I don't really think there's one set answer to your question. Personally, I can say I wasn't very good at PIC (primary, or pilot in command) flying on my own on the simulator a"

        "instruction": "What type of Rifle is an AK47?",
        "output": "What type of Rifle is an AK47? It is the most widespread and available rifle in the world. AK means Avtomat Kalashnikov (Kalashnikov Automatic Rifle) and it was named after the designer. This rifle was developed to meet the operational needs of the Soviet military forces during the Cold War. AKs are very reliable, durable, and simple to maintain. In general, the AK47 is a very accurate weapon and has a high degree of reliability. Over 70 versions of the AK family have been produced. Many countries use these rifles, including the United States. It is often referred to as the ‚ÄúK‚Äù or ‚ÄúAK‚Äù rifle. Some countries produce their own versions of this rifle, but all AKs are designed by Mikhail T Kalashnikov. The AK47 action is unique because it is gas operated (similarly to a shotgun). The 7.62x39 mm ammunition is also unique in that the case is larger than that of the AK-74 (similarly to .308 cal ammunition in the US). The AK can be equipped with a variety of optics including night vision, red dot, and sniper sights. A good, accurate AK47 can be bought for less than $500 USD.\n6 What type of Rifle is an AR15? An AR stands for ArmaLite rifle and is short for ArmaLite-15. This type of rifle is also called the M-16 since the Colt ArmaLite was the first manufacturer of this rifle (Colt was acquired by ArmaLite prior to producing the ARs). AR stands for ARmaLite and is one of the most widely used weapons on the world today. The AR15 rifle was designed to replace the M-14 rifle and be a more versatile weapon. The AR15/M16 was developed by Eugene Stoner (the rifles were originally only issued to military troops, but were later sold to civilian sport shooters and owners). Eugene Stoner‚Äôs original design for the AR was purchased by Colt Industries in 1959, and these rifles were named the AR10 and AR15 (the first being an earlier version of the AR10 prototype). ArmaLite later sued Colt, claiming that the M16 rifle was derived from their version (held by the military at the time) and the designers at Colt should have been prosecuted. Colt counter-sued ArmaLite claiming that they stole ideas and designs from Colt‚Äôs patented machine guns. This legal battle lasted from 1959 to 1976 and was settled out of court. The AR-15 action is semi-automatic and recoils and cycles the same as the AK47, but the design is different. The AR is more popular in military and civilian circles than the AK because it is more readily available. This weapon is sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúMini-14‚Äù or the ‚ÄúMini-16‚Äù to differentiate it from the Mini-14 (a rifle that was designed to be more compact, like the AK47) and the actual M16 (the military version of the AR15). The AR-15 was used by the U.S. Military starting in 1963, and it has undergone several changes in design. Over the years, the AR15 has been updated with different components. There are many different versions of this rifle in use today, but the primary designs are the AR10 (the full-sized AR15) and the M4 (a shortened version of the full-sized AR15). The AR10 was a full-sized rifle that was issued to snipers and Special Forces troops. The M4 is a compact version of the AR10 primarily issued to combat soldiers and sharpshooters. AR15‚Äôs are commonly seen by civilians, but are also used by many military and police forces around the world. The AR15/M16 can be fitted with a variety of optics including night vision, red dot, and sniper sights. A good, accurate AR15 can be bought for less than $500 USD.\n7 What type of Rifle is the Ruger 10/22? The Ruger 10/22 is the most popular .22 rifle in the world, and has"

        "output": "Hello there Obi One Kenobi, have you ever considered a Sith lifestyle? Have you ever seen the dark side of the force? If you've found yourself in this site, you should keep reading, for the truth lies within.\nWhen I went to this web site on my computer, it told me \"You don't need to be 501st to find the dark side\". That got me to thinking. If I didn't need to be 501st to find the Dark Side, why did they name the group 501st? I then noticed the message boards, and saw some of the posts. I was disturbed by some of the posts, for instance, in the \"Dark Lord and Emo\" discussion, someone was asking about having a crush on Darth Sidious. One guy said \"that's just wrong! the emo is the main thing you should be focusing on.\" I knew that this could lead to nothing but trouble!\nI then did a search for the Darth Sidious page, and discovered that this page was also devoted to Darth Vader, and I knew for a fact that the Dark Lords of the Sith were not to fall in love with their apprentices!\nAs it turned out, an impostor had set up a page for Darth Sidious with a picture of Prince Caspian as a stand-in! This has gone to my head and I've become obsessed with being Darth Sidious!\nSuddenly, I'm noticing strange powers developing in my body! I'm beginning to feel the Force on a very deep level! I'm becoming addicted to the Darth Sidious page! I suddenly remember that I saw the Dark Side of the Force, and how I became an apprentice myself!\nI decided to make my application for an apprenticeship on the Darth Sidious page, and see if I could enter the dark side. I posted this under the \"Aliens\" discussion:\n\"Most of the aliens seem to like Sidious, I'm not surprised, if you don't fall in love with Darth Sidious, something is very very wrong! I wish to become the next apprentice! I think I'd be a worthy one!\"\nThe post was moded as spam shortly after I posted it. I was disappointed to loose my application to become his apprentice, when the Emperor himself should have granted me an audience, or the Emperor himself should have at least noticed my post if he cared enough about his apprentices to ban anyone who talked back to him! Suddenly, I was overwhelmed with a feeling; I'm gonna do something about it! I quickly formulated my plan; it was dangerous, but if I succeeded, Darth Sidious would be mine forever, as a wife, and I could kill his \"wife\" Annie! I could become Sidious's apprentice, after that, I could take his place as the new Emperor, or I could kill him if I got bored! Either way, his days of bossiness were gonna end!\nI went to my room and got my lightsaber, then went downstairs. I saw my parents sitting at the table, I was surprised, my parents don't usually talk before noon! I quietly went over to them, turned on my lightsaber, and stabbed my mother first. I turned around and saw my father lying on the ground, dead. I didn't bother to wipe the blood off, as I'd seen Darth Sidious do it. I began thinking of what to do next, I knew there was only one place Darth Sidious could be; the Dark Side of the Force! I pulled out my lightsaber, and turned it on. I went into my bedroom, grabbed my suitcase and left for Dagobah. I would use the Force to guide my ship there!\nThe ship landed, but there wasn't any sign of anyone else. I started walking around in confusion, when it suddenly dawned on me! This was a trap, Darth Sidious was here, too! I was being used! Suddenly, Darth Sidious's face came on a large hologram in the back of the ship, I nearly passed out I was so happy!\n\"I am your Dark Lord, and if you are indeed the next Apprentices I have been seeking, prepare to become my apprentice!\"\nI was surprised! I didn't even know how he knew I was really the one being sought, or even knew my name! I thought back to my post on the Darth Sidious page, and remembering seeing him as Prince Casp"

        "output": "draw a man using ASCII characters in your code terminal with a guided text mnemonic along with a passage that will help me to memorize answers to questions on the topic- coordination quickly without tips. Coordination in organisms is a complicated topic, and I am sure that when I review my notes on this topic, at-least once, I will always make mistakes, and thus I will always be confused, always be lost.\nHowever, I do not want this to happen to me. This is not how learning is.\nI strongly believe that learning is a process that one should love, something that one wants to be engaged in, that one wants to always be involved in. The way I see it, the process of learning, and the process of doing anything, is all about being conscious of everything that goes on. Be careful about what triggers the process to being aware, and you will always get the most out of it.\nBe careful about the process that helps you to be aware, and you will always enjoy it!\nIn short, with awareness and consciousness, we learn efficiently and better, and we experience less stress and anxiety. With out awareness and consciousness, we become anxious, depressed, we become frustrated which affects our learning.\nLearning happens automatically and unconsciously. But it does not happen automatically without effort. It does not happen automatically without consciousness, without effort. It is effort that is required to make the process of learning happen.\nLearning to learn and learning about being aware of each process and consciousness is a process of learning in itself.\nWhenever I have to learn about something new, I always think about this: I have so many things to learn about. The world has so much to offer me. I must learn as many things as I can. I have so much to learn, and the possibilities are endless.\nIt all starts with the feeling of unlimited possibilities. With the feeling that there are so many things to learn about, and I need to learn them all. This way, I get excited about learning, I have a positive expectation and motivation about learning.\nI start with the question: ‚ÄúWhat can I learn?‚Äù\nWhen I ask this question, it takes the focus away from the goal, from answering the question of what is to learn but instead on the process of learning that leads to the goal. I give up control and let the focus go to the learning, to the process of learning and to whatever it has to offer me. I let everything that has to be learned in the past, future and my current studies come to me so it can be learned. This is when I start learning.\nI remember, I used to do that back then. I used to study for hours every day as if I was just filling up pages without knowing where I was going and what I was doing, what was the goal and why I was doing it at all. I used to study hard as if hard work was the goal, as if that was how I was supposed to pass exams.\nNow, it has all changed and I enjoy learning and the process of learning so much now that I cannot even tell you how many hours I spent learning every day, or even every week even if I could, I probably never would. Learning for me is all about enjoying my time and making the most out of it so that I have a positive attitude towards it, and also the most joyous experience of learning as possible.\nMy learning nowadays starts with my motivation to learn. I really want to learn, and I decide whether to do it or not. If I decide to do it, I do it wholehearted. With all the power within me, I do whatever it takes to learn so that my learning experience becomes the best possible and enjoyable.\nIf I don‚Äôt want to learn, or if I refuse to learn, I don‚Äôt do it. This way I take control of my learning and avoid suffering as well as wasting my energy away for no reason.\nI do whatever it takes to learn, to experience the joy of learning and the power it has over my life. I look on every single moment spent learning, every single second I am learning something new as a magical moment in my life, as treasured time, as an amazing experience. This is how I enjoy learning and make the most out of it.\nThe moment I wake up, I feel excited to be alive and I feel energized to go through this amazing journey that is my life. Every second of my life, I do whatever I am supposed to do, and I do everything with the enthusiasm and passion that I have towards life and learning.\nI remember how I used to be back then when I was studying: I felt tired all the time, I felt lost most of the time, I used to complain"

In my opinion, many people argue that the age of consent should be changed to a higher age to try to prevent some pedophiles from trying to get children to have sexual contact with adults. Although their intentions are noble, I think that raising the age of consent too high would be causing more harm than good in the long run. Although I believe that the age of consent should not be increased, I would like to mention some of the harm that could come from raising the age of consent too high. If the age of consent were to be raised too high, some young people, ages ranging from 12 to 17, could potentially be sent to prisons by having sex with older people. As a result, many of these young people could be put in situations with dangerous criminals and could be sexually abused. In order to deal with this issue, some people suggest that sex education should be made more mandatory to teach people about safe sex. However, as this suggestion implies, many young people are sexually active at a very young age and could be unprepared for sex, having to learn about safe sex as they have sex. This could lead to many young people being sexually abused or becoming sexually active too earlier than they are really ready to be. In addition, it could also lead to many young people getting pregnant at young ages. Many young people, ages 12-17, are currently having sex at a young age anyway, and raising the age of consent could make them be even more unprepared for sex. Although increasing the age of consent could help to prevent some cases of sexual abuse, increasing it too high could also lead to many other issues. As a young person myself, I definitely want to see the age of consent kept as low as possible so that people are prepared and educated about safe sex. In conclusion, I really hope that the age of consent will not be increased because it would cause many more problems than it would solve.\nThe Right to Reproduce\nAccording to many people, the right to reproduce should be a basic human right. However, as I see it, if the right to reproduce should be basic human right, it raises many other questions about reproduction. For example, why should the right to reproduce be a basic human right and not a basic human privilege. This leads to other questions about which people should have access to the right to reproduce and which people should not have access to it. If people should not have access to the right to reproduce, who should be allowed to have access to it? If people should have access to the right to reproduce, who should be allowed to have access to it? For example, if the right to reproduce should be a basic human right, but if people should not have access to the right to reproduce, who deserves access to it? In my opinion, it is difficult to answer many of these questions due to the fact that different types of people with different views about reproduction will have different ideas. If I had to give my opinion on this matter, I believe that the age of reproduction should be determined based on whether the individuals involved would be able to care for children or not. It should be a privilege only for those that are able to raise and care for their children. This way, the children involved in reproduction would be given the greatest chance to grow up in a stable and healthy environment. However, if I had to give my opinion on the right to reproduce, I believe that the ability to reproduce should be based on one‚Äôs needs, not one‚Äôs basic human rights. After all, if people in our society did not have to struggle or work to take care of themselves, why should they have the right to reproduce? If the right to reproduce is granted to everyone, this could lead to many issues such as pregn"

If you don't know what a divisor is, take a second and google that shit. For example, if I enter 22 as the number, the function should return 2 because 22 is divisible by 7, 5 and 14. Write me a function that takes an array of 3 numbers as input and returns the square of the middle number in the array, if the middle number isn't a square, returns 1.

        "output": "What is the james webb telescope and its benefits for society?. The James Webb Space Telescope is also known as JWST. At completion it will offer the greatest resolution and the greatest sensitivity ever achieved.\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of space telescopes?. The advantages are: 1) it allows for a longer amount of time (science can be performed) to perform astronomy since you are no longer limited to when it's dark out 2) you get a \"cleaner\" view of the sky since light pollution isn't an issue 3) the longer you have to observe, the better the pictures that can be produced.\nThe biggest con is that a few light years outside our solar system, the Hubble Telescope can't see further than it can't see the moon...that means you can't get super close resolution because there's just no point (however, the James Webb Telescope will be able to see a lot of faint stuff...that's why it's going to be so good).\nSpace telescopes are just like your ordinary terrestrial telescopes, but the advantages are that there's no light pollution, no atmospheric distortion, and more observing time is available if a telescope is launched into orbit around a planet.\nAstronomical telescopes help us learn by observing the universe without the interference of the earth's atmosphere. By observing distant objects such as stars, nebula, galaxies, etc. We can make the necessary adjustments and improve our understanding of the universe we live in. A space telescope would be an astronomical telescope placed in space. It would collect and focus on light from celestial objects without atmospheric interference. Space telescopes can provide us with much more detailed information regarding the universe than are available with our terrestrial telescopes. They will also be able to observe objects in different wavelengths that cannot be viewed from the earth to find things that are not visible to the unaided eye. It has been suggested that space telescopes may help us find answers to some current mysteries, such as the existence of extraterrestrial life and the development and fate of our own planet. Space telescopes can be used to find extrasolar planets and help us determine their composition, size, and distance from their hosting stars. Space telescopes may also be able to determine physical conditions such as temperature, pressure, density, and wind speed on the surfaces of distant planets that are not visible from the earth. Space telescopes may be key to future colonization plans for other planets. They could also be used to search for planets that are capable of sustaining life. They may also be useful in surveying the earth's environment and monitoring long-term changes in climate and weather patterns. The Hubble Space Telescope has given us some interesting astronomical discoveries and it has provided us with much valuable information regarding astrobiology. Since it is the first space telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope has helped to pave the way for more in depth studies of celestial objects in space.\nSome advantages of space telescope are they can be used to monitor the earth's weather and climate, can be used to search for planets that are capable of sustaining life, can be used to search for extraterrestrial life, may be able to locate objects on earth using space telescope's ability to bounce microwave radio signals, and may also help us to develop future human colonization plans for other planets. Some disadvantages include it requires a very precise aiming system and may be too expensive to operate, it requires a very large and heavy structure that will cost a lot to get into space, and it can be damaged if it's struck by large debris or space particles.\nThe main advantage of a space telescope is that it does not get in the way of the Earth's atmosphere. This allows the telescope to collect more light and thus produce clearer pictures. Additionally, space telescopes can view the universe in many different light waves. This is especially useful for learning more about the universe.\nDisadvantages of space telescopes are that they are very large and expensive to build and maintain which can mean that it takes a long time to fund them. They also face the problem of getting into space which can be difficult and expensive to accomplish. They use a lot of fuel to remain in space and function, they also often require the assistance of other spacecraft to deploy and operate effectively. Therefore, space telescopes are often quite complicated, and are prone to failure.\nSpace telescopes can be used to observe objects from a distance that we cannot see from earth. They can collect more light and are more sensitive allowing"

        "output": "can you write code? (No, seriously, what‚Äôs up with that?)\nI think we can put Bender‚Äôs quote in context and look at the way our characters, as writers, interact with our stories: ‚ÄúI think it was the perfect plan I came up with to kill us all, so I had to go back and kill myself as an obstacle‚Ä¶ It was stupidly complex; a real challenge for the writer.‚Äù The question, then, becomes: who exactly is ‚Äúus‚Äù in this quote? (And, if you‚Äôve been paying attention, why are you reading this in the first place?) I‚Äôd wager a good guess is that ‚Äúus‚Äù is our characters, while ‚Äúme‚Äù is our narration. Here is my plan: to write a novella that has at its core a great story, and a great narrator/writer, who, as Bender says, was too smart for his own good.\nHere‚Äôs how I imagined a good story: a protagonist comes to a small town to solve a mystery; the mystery is murder, the victim is the protagonist‚Äôs father; it turns out the murder isn‚Äôt a case of random crime, but something more personal, and the murderer is someone the protagonist loves very much. The book is about what that discovery does to everyone involved, the way it brings pain, and anger, and even death, but that it also teaches people that love and forgiveness can be stronger than hate and prejudice.\nThe story would be told from the point of view of a young man (protagonist) whose father is murdered, and the rest of the book would be told in flashback, following the protagonist as he returns to his hometown and the people there, with whom he has struggled, his whole life, to make sense, following the path his life took leading up to the murder, and all its ramifications, both in the case itself, and in how it affects the interpersonal relationship among many of the town‚Äôs residents. It would be a mystery, with all the trappings that come with it: an antagonist, false leads, red herrings, action, romance, and so forth. It would incorporate the various themes that are my stock in trade: prejudice and racism, bullying, mental illness, and domestic violence; there would be some subterfuge, as well, and, of course, the protagonist‚Äôs struggle with his family. The question: how can the protagonist come out on top, without feeling like a victim? Without using stereotypical tropes to get that resolution? If I‚Äôm being blunt, with that plot, I felt like I was ‚Äútoo smart‚Äù for myself; the book became a kind of game, and the characters became puppets, with the murderer as the main ‚Äúbad guy,‚Äù and the protagonist as the hero, who defeats the antagonist by overcoming the prejudice and hatred of which he is all too much a victim.\nHmm‚Ä¶ Maybe there‚Äôs something to all this Bender-ism: ‚ÄúIf any civilization, any society, any species on this planet, or any other, can figure out a way to live in harmony with the others, if they can get along with each other the way I do with my own species, there‚Äôs hope for us all.‚Äù I gotta ask myself the question Bender asks: who am I writing it for?\nI mean, here‚Äôs a secret about me: I‚Äôve been pretty sure about my sexual orientation almost as long as I can remember understanding what that means. And, yet, growing up in the 70s, I knew that, in addition to the cultural attitudes surrounding it, I had to worry about homophobia within my family: my father, a religious man, would not take this news well, and I was worried about what that would do to my parents‚Äô relationship with me, and with each other.\nAs it happened, my fears were unfounded: when I got home from school that afternoon, everything was fine. Mom‚Äôs not usually in the house when Dad‚Äôs home, but this day she‚Äôd stayed home sick from work‚Äîand there was the answer to why she was home. My dad was furious I‚Äôd told her; and Dad doesn‚Äôt hold back when he‚Äôs hurt or angry‚Äîsometimes physically. But, this time, my parents‚Äô relationship prevailed; Mom was there when Dad came home, saying he was welcome; that she understood and loved me as her son; and that she and Dad would be OK. Dad didn‚Äôt say that, but I knew it was true, anyway. And Dad didn‚Äôt say"

This week is all about Thursday.)\nSometimes, I put the book on a shelf and it's the author that gets shelved with it. Sometimes it's not the author, just the writer. Sometimes it's not the writer, just the publisher. Sometimes, and this is sad, it's not even the book. Just the idea. The name. The cover. Here's a good one that I'm holding out for the right publisher to take out of my hands: THE PIRATE BOOK. It's about a pirate who has a little problem. I had another great idea the other that would be a good one for a television show. There could be a whole channel devoted to it. Then I remembered that I can't write shows with a little problem, I can't write shows with problems that are also ideas. The idea of a show like that was a great idea. It was good enough to get people excited, but it wasn't a writer. The show must go on.\nHere's a good quote about books and reading and thinking, though please don't take it too seriously:\n\"Books are so much better than television and movies, because they let your mind run wild and they take you to places you've never been. Your imagination goes to work and you can picture things happening at night like ghosts coming out of paintings to steal the art at museums. I can picture the gargoyles flying from all the spires and church towers and the statues of saints and princes coming to life.\"\nAnd with that, I think it's as simple as that.\nSometimes, when you go into a book store, there's a sense of being transported. It's a feeling like this:\nThere is nothing like bookstores. I don't think I'm ever going to understand people who say they're out of date. Who say people are out of date. You know what else is out of date? The whole idea of being out of date. It seems so backward. To look back, like you've made progress. You know what I haven't made? A book store. There's nothing wrong with that.\nWhat I do know is that the book store is going to be very different very soon. There won't be book stores, because they'll just be part of a greater thing. There won't be a book store, because the store will no longer be the book. In the end, I hope all of our stores will be bookstores‚Äîit's what we're designed for. That's why it's so important that we think bigger‚Äîand keep thinking bigger. We've become the place you come to when you need a good book, but there's a whole lot more to come in the next 10 years than that.\nRemember that book from a few years ago with all that stuff about books being a dying art and people only read from screens and blah, blah, blah? You can put it away now. The world has changed, but it's not a black and white change. It's in color, and that always makes for the best stories. One thing to remember is that in the age of the book, the stories, the ideas, the imagination, the writing, the creativity didn't change, only the methods used to publish them. They were always being told, and they will always be, and so will the ways to tell them. It's not that you have to choose between being online‚Äîa place where you have a platform and can share your ideas with the world‚Äîand the physical book that's right there for people that you know and care about. It's never binary. It's all one thing. I think maybe a good way to envision it is this:\nI love technology. That's why I use it. That's why I don't spend all of my time worrying about it. Or even"

You can read about my novel Troll in my blog post titled: Troll, a Fantasy Novel in Progress.\nTroll takes place in a mythical setting created using elements of German culture and folklore (the titular trolls are inspired by the legendary creatures of the region). These elements are presented by way of the fictional culture of the Faynar, a semi-medieval society situated somewhere in Germany or Austria. The Faynar are comprised of elves living in isolation, a nomadic race of trolls, and a small community of humankind. The Faynar have a rich mythology, unique languages, and customs that I'm using as a springboard for a fantasy novel. My central idea will be to use these elements to tell a story about a troll named Dust who is banished from his clan for questioning society and is subsequently enslaved by a human woman, taking him to her remote village. There he struggles to adapt to his new life while at the same time trying to understand the human world and society from a trolls point of view.\nThat's the basic premise of my novel, but I've got some great ideas that will help me flesh it out into a compelling and engaging fantasy story. I will also be posting some sample chapters from the novel as I work on them and as time allows. So stay tuned!\nThis topic has 5 replies, 3 voices, and was last updated 3 years, 8 months ago by Bubbles.\nYeah this is my second novel, though I'll probably have to rework it in some way due to some feedback I got.\nThe novel is inspired by an old TV series called \"Kung Fu\". My story is basically about a man who has lost his family and lives in a monastery fighting off bandits that have destroyed his community. The central character of the story is named Liu, though it's really the tale of a young boy named Ming, the same character from Kung Fu. I've always found the series kind of a cheesy, but in a good way. I thought it would be interesting to adapt the premise of the TV show into a more serious and literary kind of fantasy work. Here's roughly what I have so far for an outline.\nI'm looking at an almost medieval fantasy setting which draws on Chinese and Japanese elements, using some of the myth and legend inspired by the original TV series. I also want to make sure I give the background of the place where the story is set, so I'm really going at it from the setting up as opposed to the main plot of the story right off the bat. I want readers to feel like they are being introduced to a culture that exists within a world (not some imaginary realm).\nFor the main character I'm kind of sticking with the name Liu. My intention was to make him some kind of mysterious recluse that has experienced a lot in his life. I'm looking at a kind of quiet and stoic personality, though kind and thoughtful. In a way it's not too dissimilar from the original Master Po from Kung Fu, who was something of a monk and was a sort of loner. I'm kind of still figuring out the exact characterization of Liu and some of his relationships. For example I'm considering having Liu as a student of some kind. Someone that was probably trained by the monastery, though more likely by the town's master than one of the high priest of the monastery. A lot of it I'm going to have to figure out as I go along, but for now I'm just working on the setting.\nMy only concern with this is that I'm not sure how to blend fantasy and realism when describing my setting and how it could work out as a novel. The setting is going to have a very traditional feel to it, with very medieval settings and characters (though the focus is kind of on the cultural elements). I'm also hoping that this blend would offer some interesting opportunities for commentary on real world religions and ideologies like Christianity and Confucianism. There's a part where the main character has a discussion with another character about the religious influences in the village.\nI'm also looking at a mix of martial arts and swordplay, with a central focus on a realism inspired"

In particular, we employ an embedding-agnostic framework that leverages prior work on modeling the generative distribution of text, through multi-task learning [198, 142, 201], and sequence-to-sequence modeling [187, 101].\nDemonstrate the ability to generate long, coherent text in response to a spoken prompt. To accomplish this task we are combining recent advances in speech transcription and natural language pre-training [198, 272] with techniques that use temporal information [116] and reinforce the alignment of the model‚Äôs semantic understanding of text and audio [110].\nDemonstrate the ability to generate multiple types of speech in response to a spoken prompt. To accomplish this task, we are combining pre-training techniques for speech and text [198, 272] with recent advances in modeling sequence-to-sequence models [109]. In particular,\nOur system generates audio by decoding the pre-trained audio encoder into a sequence of speech frames that we then sample and replay using a text-to-speech neural network.\nOur system generates text by first transcribing the audio into a sequence of text, then reformatting portions of the text into the requested sentence format, and finally decoding the text from the pre-trained text encoder.\nThe authors describe GPT-3 as a \"neural language model\" trained on a \"huge amount\" of human text from Wikipedia:\nWe train the underlying language model (LM) on 1.5B tokens of plain text using the publicly-available Wikipedia, divided into 483B training instances and 65M testing instances.\nThe team also writes that \"we additionally pre-train a large-scale speech encoder and add a number of pre-training tasks designed to improve the performance of the speech encoder.\" The authors also make heavy use of an open source tool called TensorFlow Extended:\nOur experiments make use of TensorFlow Extended, a python module that provides many of the advanced features of TensorFlow (e.g., distributed training in multi-gPU environments) as well as many features designed for natural language processing, such as: (i) a fast GPU-based text and code pre-processing framework that can quickly process and parse very large datasets; (ii) a shared-variable based text summary generation framework that can process extremely large datasets in seconds; and (iii) language modeling, speech modeling, and sequence generation/generative text-to-speech frameworks with state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.\nFurther, GPT-3 is not trained from scratch but leverages \"a previous variant of the model we developed as PEGASUS, the \"Open Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition System\" (OLVSR).\" The team also uses \"the Speech Transcription Library, which has demonstrated state-of-the-art speech-to-text performance on a variety of public datasets\" when pre-processing audio files.\nRegarding the model size, the team writes that"

For example, in 2018, I had the privilege to be selected as an NUS Outstanding Student Ambassador for my faculty. It was a meaningful opportunity to engage with the students and share the joy of learning. It was also a chance to make an impact and contribute to the well-being of the NUS community.\nSo far, my biggest challenge is to achieve work-life balance. As a full-time undergraduate studying at NUS, it is difficult to strike a healthy balance despite the support from teachers and course mates. Despite facing various challenges, I believe that the important values taught by NUS, such as leadership and teamwork, will help me overcome hurdles.\nInspired by my course mates as well as the dedicated and supportive teachers, I learned to adapt to different situations and make the most out of challenges. This enhanced my persistence and resilience towards future challenges in life and the working world.\nThe courses, internships and research opportunities at NUS also provided me with the necessary skills to further prepare for my future endeavours. As the current Chairperson of the Student Council Leadership Development (SCLD), I have the opportunity to work with SCLD alumni to provide mentorship to the incoming student council and student leaders.

        "output": "Does the 5 second rule actually exist?\n5 second rule in the kitchen ‚Äì does it work?\nThe 5 second rule, the official rule where you get a 5 second window in the kitchen to eat something that‚Äôs been on the floor before it becomes disgusting. Now, that is a question that‚Äôs been asked by many people around the world, does 5 second rule actually exist?\nAnd today, the answer is no.\nThis is an interesting question, because there have been studies done on the 5 second rule and some of them are contradictory, and I‚Äôm just going to bring a few more up and we‚Äôll discuss these things in this week‚Äôs topic.\nFirst thing, some people have tested the 5 second rule with their kids, or children in general. The 5 second rule doesn‚Äôt have any effect on bacteria that fall on your food. So if you drop a hamburger on the floor, it‚Äôs gonna be disgusting. But children don‚Äôt look at it that way, they‚Äôre only worried about if they eat it or not. And that is basically the 5 second rule to kids. I mean, it‚Äôs an excuse for kids to eat stuff that they‚Äôre not supposed to. And it seems to work for some kids to a degree. But again, most of the kids are using the 5 second rule just in a desperate attempt to avoid eating something that‚Äôs no longer edible and this is kind of the excuse for using food that‚Äôs dropped.\nNow, there are some other studies done in actual labs and they said that food can acquire some bacteria in 5 seconds, but I‚Äôm interested in seeing how it actually happens. How does food acquire 5 different bacteria in 5 seconds? And here, I‚Äôm thinking of the bacteria that causes food poisoning, because that‚Äôs what I was actually worried about. I‚Äôm worried, if this bacteria is actually in my food for only 5 seconds, will my food become poisonous in that short amount of time? But it‚Äôs more likely that this food would be poisonous anyway.\nSo, food acquire bacteria within 5 seconds, it‚Äôs probably only gonna happen to food that‚Äôs already been contaminated in the first place, but it does happen.\nFor example, there‚Äôs one study that was done with strawberries, they just dropped strawberries on the ground for a few hours and they bacteria level went up on the strawberry and they increased 100 times the bacteria level and here is the problem with these types of studies. They‚Äôre actually on strawberries, so it kind of makes sense that they can catch that many bacteria. But you never have the strawberry fall on your food and if you do, and if it‚Äôs contaminated with bacteria, you don‚Äôt wanna be eating it. So in most cases, this is not a real concern.\nWhat is interesting and something that I want to talk about to a little bit is the study where they tested 5 second rule with actual bacteria, not with strawberries, and it‚Äôs actually a very interesting case. They put bacteria on a piece of paper, they waited for 30 seconds and they transferred them onto bread. And this is a bit dangerous, because you can‚Äôt really make bread with bacteria. If it was bacteria, it‚Äôs just not safe to eat, I mean not to mention that it may kill you too.\nThe result after this test was that there was about 8 times more bacteria on the bread for 30 seconds than there was on the paper after 30 seconds. So, in other words, bacteria will take longer to attach to a piece of bread, than it will take for the bacteria to attach to the paper surface.\nSo, if someone drops bread on the floor and you have a 5 second rule and you eat it within the first 5 seconds, because you thought it was edible, you‚Äôre very likely to be eating bacteria or poisonous microorganisms.\nSo, that‚Äôs another bit of contradictory evidence. There are actually some good points to the 5 seconds rule, but you‚Äôre much better off being careful, not rushing to pick stuff up, pick it up, smell it, if it‚Äôs rotten, leave it. But if you are eating a piece of bread and you think someone is dropping on the floor, that is a very good reason to not eat it immediately.\nI also wanted to add that some"

It is a probe vehicle, but the probes that are on it are not the probes you are thinking of.\nA parsec is a distance, which is a measure of distance. It is a distance of about 3.26 light years.\nThe distance to the center of Andromeda is about 2.64 million parsecs.

So if the probes went beyond the speed of light‚Ä¶ What exactly would happen to them? Would they not reach the ship?

All we know so far is that there will probably be a lot of activity happening there, but we don‚Äôt understand how that activity will be related to dark matter and neutron stars.\nHow do the probes travel, in terms of what power source is used to propel them forward?\nThe probes are powered by super-compact power sources called p-batteries. The batteries are very powerful. They can also propel the ships.\nIs the ship one big probe? And when the people got on the ship, did the ship transport them through time as well? How are you so sure that the ship isn‚Äôt just holographic, and that nobody on the ship really exists?\nThe ship is not a probe. It is not a spaceship. It is a large space station and contains a lot of technology that can make it go wherever and do whatever it wants.\nThe ‚ÄúNickelodeon Starship‚Äù is not holographic and it is very real!\nDo you mean the ‚ÄúNickelodeon Starship‚Äù?\nNo, it‚Äôs the ship with all the 7200 probes.

Has a 5% chance of paralyzing its victim. It could learn a move to copy and learn a move to increase its speed.\nHow would you create a new Pokemon? Why would you create it like that?\nI would pick a few characteristics that I like and make a Pokemon based off that.\nwhat would you bring if you could bring any pokemon as a pet?\nI‚Äôd bring Ditto, but I am very limited since I am a very creative person by nature.\nHow would you describe yourself as an artist?\nI would describe myself as an imaginative person that likes to paint the picture (literally) inside my head and bring them to life.\nhow has your relationship with art changed from the time you began drawing to today?\nAs I grow older, I have realized the value of good art and I try to work as hard on my art as I can.\nHow are you trying to evolve your art style?\nI am trying to learn a bit of human anatomy, since it is extremely important to draw believable characters to get more attention.\nHow would you define or define art to children?\nI would first ask them what they think art is and then talk to them about their own point of view and their own interpretation of art and then I‚Äôll try to show them how I interpret art.\nHow has your relationship with art changed from childhood to adulthood?\nBeing a young artist is a very fun thing, but it gets harder as the time passes, and your vision gets more mature (though it may be different for each artist), as an adult I always seek to improve my art and get better at it (which comes along with maturity).\nhow do you define your personal style?\nIn art, by definition, one defines their style by their signature and the choice of colors. My personal style is simple and expressive.\nWhen did you fall in love with art?\nWhen I was in the fourth grade, I saw a poster about a game called ‚ÄúFly Odyssey‚Äù. The character design really fascinated me and I really felt like I want to draw just like that, so I started drawing and painting characters in a style similar to ‚ÄúFly Odyssey‚Äù with help from my parents who were an art teacher and an artist.\nWhat challenges/barriers have you faced in being a professional artist that you weren‚Äôt expecting when you started your art career?\nThe first one was the rejection. I first tried to apply for jobs in game companies, but I was rejected and thought that my dream has failed, but my journey taught me that art is a path that I can do without the need to go to a specific job, but I must still work hard on my art to get better and make myself stand out.\nWhen you don‚Äôt create art for an extensive amount of time, what do you do to ‚Äúget back‚Äù into your creative flow?\nThe first thing I do if I don‚Äôt create art for an extended period of time is to read articles and watch tutorials to get back in the mood.\nWith all the advancement in technology today, how do you prefer to create? If you prefer one over another, why do you prefer this one?\nI prefer to create digitally, although I use traditional techniques to make certain designs, but it took me a very long time to learn and I prefer to create digitally.\nWhy did you decide to be a professional artist?\nIn my childhood, art has always been part of me since the time I started drawing. In my early adolescence, I started to study art and later became very interested in the art of video games, so I chose to be a professional artist because I believe that is the best way to express myself and also to make myself proud.\nAfter having seen your art, what would you like someone like myself to take away from your work?\nI would like you to see my art with all the hard work invested and see my passion for art from a different perspective and hopefully you can learn as much from my art as I learned from other artists around the world.\nWhat are some of things that have been the most challenging for you as an artist?\nIn the beginning it was the fear of fail, that I could not accomplish anything with my art, but with time, I grew stronger and became more confident.\nName 3 pieces of art that have inspired you‚Ä¶and why?\nFor a long time, I was inspired by the art in video games"

A common mistake is having a blank line above an example when the line numbering should continue from where the last example finished. (See the next section for more tips.) Here's an example:. ## Example. Example Example. To avoid problems with examples that span multiple lines you should use the Python Markdown extension. You could also use two backticks for the first line of a multi line example but it is better to use one so that it looks like this: # Example Example. ## Example. Another common problem is forgetting that Markdown line numbers always start over from one. This will happen if you have a blank line at the start of a multi-line example or if you use the backtick character to start a code block. Either use the Python Markdown extension which does all of this for you or the following example will not have this problem. If you make a mistake marking a line as an example by using a backtick then you can fix the problem by removing the backtick using a regular backtick character: . # Example example Examples should not have multiple examples. One example per example. ## Example. # Example # The following is not an example it is a mistake: ## Example. ## Example. You can see how the Markdown line numbers have jumped. This is why you should use the Python Markdown extension so that line numbers always start at one. The following Markdown will have exactly the same problem: ### Examples should not have multiple examples. One example per example. ## Example. Markdown doesn't have any formatting for code so you will need to use a different extension for each language. You can use the Python Markdown extension to do this for Python. If you don't want to do that install another extension such as [mdpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mdpy) and use that to mark the example code. You should check out the [examples](https://djangobook.sourceforge.net/en/1.0/examples.html) in the book for information on how to format code in Python Markdown. ## The following is not an example it is a mistake. ### Examples should not have multiple examples.

The following example can be found in the [Chapter 8](https://djangobook.info/en/1.0/ch08/) of the book: ### Installing Django ### Installing Django is a very simple affair but it is important that you have Django properly installed before proceeding. If you get an error during the installation then that is all the more reason to have an up-to-date copy of the [Django installation instructions](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/). One of the most common problems is that you are using a very old copy of Python and you need to upgrade it. Another problem is that you are using a different version of Django. The current version of Django is v1.1 but this book was written using version Django v1.0. Check [the install guide](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) for the exact version that you need to install in order for this book to work correctly. == Running the Project == The next section describes the steps that you need to take in order to use this book. You can download a copy of the project code that was used to write this book from [the code](http://djangobook.info/en/1.0/_code.html) page. This page describes the steps that you need to take in order to [get the code running](http://djangobook.info/en/1/1/intro.html#get-the-code-running). If you just want to read the book without doing all of these steps then you can use the online (Chrome-) version which automatically runs the code whenever you make changes. You can also run the sample code in [Jython](http://jython.org/) which makes a nice change from having to use Python 3 or Django 1.1 as that is what this book was written using. If you want to try out running your own version of the [Blog](https://djangobook.info/) then you can follow the [getting started document](https://djangobook.info/en/1/_starting_blog_installing.html) which describes the steps that you need to take"

The problem is asking for the sum of 17 +5. To solve the problem, begin by adding the numbers in the mathematical order in which they are written. This is a shortcut. One way to solve a math problem is to use the addition method in the mind. If this was your own method, we thank you for sharing! Math in Focus is a self-directed homeschool math curriculum that incorporates hands-on, whole-body teaching. This method is known as the. Step 10. When you are first learning math, problems are often stated as addition and require that you use addition to find the answer. This is called the addition method in mathematical thinking. I am using a self-directed math curriculum with my daughter and wanted to know if you would share your methods with me? Here it is. It is important to always be prepared to add and subtract numbers. Step 2. In the add method, we write the numerals in our mind as we place the answer on the paper. If the answer is 12, then 12 should come easily to your mind. How to use the Add Method The add method of solving the calculation is as follows: 1. The math workbook has three steps to each math problem solving equation. To teach this method would be very easy. Step 7. Write the sum as shown in the above image. In order to solve this problem, we need to use the addition method.\nIf the math problem asks us to find the sum of an addition problem, then we use the addition method. When a math problem is given in the form sum of a and b, a and b are the numbers that are going to be added in order to find the sum.\nThe add method of solving the calculation is as follows: 1. The first step is to draw a number line that represents the numbers in the problem. In this case, we have the numbers 17 and 5. Step 3. This is the way to get the answer. Step 2. The second step is to write the problem on the number line.\nIf you want to see how this step works, go to the next step in this article. Step 3. Write a number that adds to the next number.\nFor example, 17 plus 5 will equal So we will write 5 after 17. Step 4. Write a number that adds to the number you just wrote.\nStep 5. Continue writing numbers until you reach the end. Step 6. Add the numbers together and write the answer. Step 7. Write the sum as shown in the above image.\nStep 8. Make sure you write the answer outside of the number line. Step 9. Write the answer as an equation.

If we wanted to cover our ‚Äútours‚Äù faster, we would need to reduce our times between rest breaks. Would that cause any other issues? Yes, any long-duration walker will experience sore feet, aching knees, and back pain. Can we find a way to reduce the rest breaks? Yes, we can wear lightweight shoes, hiking boots or bare feet without shoes, thereby reducing the work associated with lifting each foot. We can also carry lightweight backpacks or wear belts to carry our stuff. Would these modifications take some time to get used to? Absolutely, it would take some time to get used to lightweight footwear and carry a backpack around all the time. These modifications would allow us to cover longer distance without so much fatigue/exhaustion. Now, can we walk faster then rats/dogs? If one could run with a pace of 40 kph instead of 5 kph, it would take about 3 days to run a 100 km marathon. 1.\tIf we want to cover larger distances in lower times, we need to reduce/eliminate the rest breaks. As discussed earlier, this can be achieved by lightweight footwear/backpack/belt and by carrying lightweight gears. This would increase our speed and allow us to cover longer distance in shorter times. But, we are not rats/dogs who can run for long lengths of distance, have to walk for longer times and are not used to covering large distances while carrying stuff. 2.\tIt is important to know and understand that, different animal are designed for survival in different ways; with different physical requirements, different food requirements and different types of physical activities. Their survival depends upon their ability to adapt to the needs of their environment and find the resources required to survive. As humans, we are designed/designed to survive in our environment, but we require different types of resources (food, shelter and clothing) to survive. So, human is better designed and has higher potential to adapt/cope with diverse environmental conditions as compared to most of the other animals. But, different animals are designed to survive in different ways- some can outrun the other animals, some can climb higher and others can swim across the oceans. Would humans able to adapt and survive in these other conditions? Maybe. It is possible that humans too can be designed to survive under these extreme conditions. For example, we know that some of the animals have developed different features to help them survive better and thrive in the other parts of the world. For example, some animals have developed longer necks/tentacles to help them reach food. Some animals have developed longer legs and narrower feet which helps them run faster or climb higher to reach their food/shelter. Some animals have developed special characteristics, such as the ability to hibernate during the winter or camouflaged ones to help them blend with the environment during difficult times and thus helping them survive better. So, it is possible that we could be designed and be able to survive in extreme conditions. But, would that make us any better than the other animals? It won‚Äôt. As humans, we have higher potential to survive and adapt to the changing/diverse conditions, it might help us survive in better and faster ways compared to many of the other animals (especially the long-distance runners), but that doesn‚Äôt mean that we are better than the other animals. We should never try to look better, survive better, be stronger or be faster compared to the other animals or be better than the other human beings. All of us should learn to live in peace with one another and co-exist in a harm"

        "output": "If I found a dollar bill, would it be illegal to keep it ? Certain laws might come into effect, but it would not be considered illegal to keep it. If you found it on the ground where others are walking, it might be theft and not considered illegal. Same goes for finding something in someone's possession. If I found $5,000 , would it be illegal to keep ? Assuming , it would be considered illegal until you turn it over to the owner. You could get sued for recovery costs which is why it would be illegal. I might get a fine depending on the circumstances. If I found $10,000 , would it be illegal to keep? It would be considered illegal because there is a monetary value that could be associated with something found. Illegal to keep might be a tad harsh, but it could be punishable by fines or recovery costs. It would be considered theft in most cases, but there is a monetary value for the $10K. Illegal to keep ? Certainly , but not illegal in and of itself. It's the value of the item that may be used in determining what's illegal. I would not recommend keeping anything even if it was found on the ground. If I found $10K at the store, but I only had to pay $9K for the item, would it be legal to keep what I paid for ? Not really, because it's not in a legal manner. I could try it, but I wouldn't advise it. I might not ever be caught and not get in any trouble for it , but it's just not worth it. If it does start bothering me down the road and I have to turn it in, I'll have to explain everything. That might be a little awkward, especially if the person was overcharged to make the purchase . I might feel guilty about it , too and I don't like that feeling. If I found a $10,000 in rolls of coins, would it be legal to keep it ? Most certainly not . I guess I would have to check to see how much was made by mistake. The person who made it would know it was coins and not bills and I know it was a legal amount. I would not keep it even if I found it on the ground and I would report it to the proper authorities. It would not be considered theft . I would just be returning it on behalf of the person who it belonged to. If I found a 20 dollar bill , would it be illegal to keep it ? I would consider it illegal to keep . The value of the bill might not seem like much, but you can end up with an unlawful possession charge for holding something that's not yours . There's nothing special about a $20 dollar bill that would make it something I wouldn't want to turn over. It's the value of any money found that makes it illegal to keep unless it's turned over to the rightful owner. Even if it's not worth any value at all, you should not keep it and turn it over immediately. If I found a $200 bill , would it be illegal to keep ? If I found a $20 , I would consider it to be illegal and I would turn it over to the owner or the police department if I could not find the owner. I would try to find an owner that would be the best alternative and keep my possession of the bill to a minimal . I would definitely not keep it if I knew who the owner was and the bill was not turned over immediately. The longer you keep it, the greater chance you'll end up getting in some kind of trouble. If I found something worth $200, I would try to find the owner . I would not have an unlawful possession of it because it's worth the value and that's what's important. It's worth more than the $20 value bill, so it's not considered theft, but I would certainly not keep it for myself. Would I keep it if I could not find the owner ? If the owner of that $200 bill could not be found, I would turn it over to the police department and let them find out who it belongs to . Since I can't keep it for myself, I would let the authorities figure it out how I found it . Someone will always find it and if it has value to them, they will certainly keep it until the rightful owner was found. Why would it be illegal to keep a bill if the owner is unknown ? It's considered stealing for some odd reason . That's the penalty for doing it and since it's not yours in the first place, you should not do that and turn it over unless the law"

The following exam question considers several of these topics and asks you to describe a research approach and how it is used to study a specific hypothetical situation.\nIn a recent survey of college students, researchers found that 40% of respondents reported using illegal substances (e.g., marijuana) in the past 12 months. The researchers were interested in finding the best way to prevent and reduce college students‚Äô use of illegal drugs. They decided to test a number of different approaches to determine which is the most effective. Researchers want to know whether and which different types of intervention approaches are the most successful in preventing drug use in college students. Research methods appropriate to answer this question include the following: ‚Ä¢ \u0007Survey students at the beginning of each semester to assess patterns and trends in their use of illegal substances. ‚Ä¢ \u0007Design a survey and interviews to understand the attitudes and beliefs of the students in order to determine possible reasons for the high use of illegal substances among college students (e.g., feelings of social ostracism, high stress levels). ‚Ä¢ \u0007Conduct naturalistic observations of students‚Äô behaviors during their free time or when they are hanging out with friends to identify common factors that could be related to their use of illegal drugs (e.g., drinking, smoking). ‚Ä¢ \u0007Conduct a systematic review to identify and synthesize empirical and theoretical evidence related to risk factors, protective factors, and the efficacy of interventions to prevent and reduce college students‚Äô use of illegal substances. ‚Ä¢ \u0007Collect biological samples (e.g., hair, urine) from a selected sample of college students and conduct analyses (e.g., serum drug levels) to establish patterns of illicit substance use among the different groups of students. ‚Ä¢ \u0007Conduct a psychophysiological study using electroencephalography (EEG) to assess and compare brain wave patterns among college students who report high or low frequency use of illicit substances. ‚Ä¢ \u0007Use advanced statistical models to analyze the data captured by the EEG devices to develop an accurate and comprehensive predictive model for the use of illicit substances among college students. ‚Ä¢ \u0007Conduct a decision-making modeling study to assess the effectiveness of different interventions in prevent"

        "output": "What are F-centers in crystallography ? How are they created and what consequences do they have on the overall appearance of crystal ? F-center: A defect in a crystal is any departure from its structure that results in the presence of one or more atoms or atoms of different types at an unusual site or a site at which all atoms of the same type would normally be present. The defect responsible for the presence of f-centers is a vacancy. F-centers can be described as colorless to yellow, pin-point to diffuse, spots in X-ray and optical diffraction patterns and of low to moderate intensity. This is the best method for assessing the relative purity of the material and establishes if it is suitable for the intended final use. F-centers can also be responsible for crystals exhibiting large anomalous diffraction and lead to a low intensity signal in the x-ray pattern. This effect is known as the Fresnel reflection and when large numbers of f-centers appear at the same crystallographic plane, they interact with the crystallographic plane in a manner which gives rise to a very high scattering pattern at a given crystallographic plane. This is known as the Laue diffraction pattern. What are F-center ?: F-center can be described as small, pin-point to diffuse, spots in X-ray or optical diffraction patterns and of low to moderate intensity. These are not considered to be useful properties in crystals with respect to any commercial applications. They are generally regarded as contaminants which will decrease the brilliance of the diffraction pattern and adversely affect the spectral characteristics as observed in the optical range for crystals of use to optics and photonics industries. Why are f-centers created ?: Vacancy defects are created as a result of impurities in the substance or during the synthesis of the component. F-center defects are generally introduced during the synthesis of crystals which undergo growth from seeds as the material is slowly built up and grows larger in size. Chemical components are added to the solution, which is subjected to various processes such as heating, cooling and the like, to induce f-center defects when these processes are not properly controlled and supervised. These are generally due to impurities or contaminants incorporated into the solution or due to a process which is too aggressive or intense with respect to the crystal. Processes which are too intense or aggressive are always precarious in nature and can cause a variety of defects to the resultant crystal. What are the differences between interstitial and substitutional defects ? : This refers to the presence of foreign atoms or those of different chemical composition within a single crystal which are known as interstitial sites. These sites contain substances not normally present in the crystal lattice. Substitutional defects, on the other hand, are those which contain atoms of the same composition but of different atomic arrangements from those of the lattice. In the case of interstitial site defects the substance is different in nature as compared to the original crystal. It is an intruder in the lattice structure whereas in substitutional defects the additional atom or atoms is part of the original lattice structure and therefore, this type of defect would contribute to an improvement of lattice symmetry rather than act as an intruder. What are the consequences of f-center creation ?: F-center defects result in a lower resolution in the diffraction pattern of the material. This effect is exacerbated in the case of large numbers of f-centers which cause substantial scattering of x-rays. Therefore, a lower intensity of x-ray diffraction is produced by f-center containing areas in the crystal which in effect leads to lesser contrast in the diffraction pattern. As a result, f-center containing areas can severely compromise the quality and efficacy of any crystal which is intended to be used for medical and other scientific purposes. Why is the Fresnel reflection important ?: The Fresnel reflection, in conjunction with F-center defects, can act together to produce a characteristic Laue diffraction pattern and to increase the scattering of x-rays by the crystal as compared to those of a pure crystal. In the case of crystals where many f-centers are present at a given crystallographic plane, the Fresnel effect and the F-center effect combine to produce a substantially distorted and diffuse x-ray scattering pattern at a given crystallographic plane. Why are large F-center defects considered to be undesirable ?: Large F-center defects in cryst"

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,\nSo what have I got wrong, and why did the Pope give Mr. Manni Manny two rings?\nI‚Äôve got nothing against the Pope. He‚Äôs the world‚Äôs foremost expert on all things Catholic, and I like having his opinion on the subject. It was his very own Holy Ghost who helped Bill Clinton out of his impeachment mess, and I‚Äôm just glad that Bill was able to stay in office after the stain (and stain cover-up) removal team cleaned up the area. I‚Äôm sure that if the Pope and Bill had ever shared a beer or three, they would have laughed together and cried together, just like two of the closest friends in the whole world! (Methinks the Pope and Mr. Clinton would have had much in common‚Ä¶ both were born with foreskin‚Ä¶ the Pope was born in Austria‚Ä¶ both were gay‚Ä¶ both were atheists‚Ä¶ both were married to extremely well-formed women‚Ä¶ both had children.. and both are very well-endowed, with a penchant for dressing like nuns.)\nI‚Äôm just surprised/surprised that Mr. Manni got two rings on his fingers (presumably for the Pope who gave them to him and for Jesus). It‚Äôs bad enough for a priest to give someone ‚ÄúBlessed‚Äù rings‚Ä¶ to get them on one‚Äôs fingers ‚Ä¶ for a woman‚Äôs wedding ring ‚Ä¶ is not something I would have expected for a man who calls himself ‚ÄúMr.‚Äù\nPerhaps Mr. Manni is so well-endowed that Pope Francis would like to take a quick break and relieve himself in his mouth.\nI‚Äôm guessing that Mr. Manni‚Äôs rings come from the same person/company who made the Pope his rings.\nI‚Äôm glad that Mr. Manni is on a job hunt, and I would like to tell him to give our current POTUS a call, to see if there is something that our current POTUS can do to help get him closer to the place which would put him in a position to be able to give Obama plenty of suggestions on how to keep Obamacare ‚Ä¶ which was passed under the previous POTUS, and is the reason why the previous POTUS won two Presidential elections and a Nobel Peace Price ‚Ä¶ can be stopped in its tracks.\nThere you have it, folks!

        "output": "Give me a list of 5 words where the letters of the words are in alphabetical order. One example: \"doors\". \"d\" comes before \"o\", \"o\" comes before \"r\", and \"r\" comes before \"s\". So the word order is \"d\", \"o\", \"r\", \"s\", and \"doors\". Give more examples.\nAlice's Answer:\nThe words in the list are:\n(1) Anesthesia\n(2) Pencil\n(3) Quarterback\n(4) Revenue\n(5) Treasure\nThe word list is given below:\nThe word list is:\nHere are a few more examples and a few hints on how to answer puzzles like this:\nExample: Do you know the words \"treasure\" and \"revenue\"? Well, the first letter comes before the last (T-R), so that's a help. Also, you need to look for words which all follow this same pattern, like \"pencil\" and \"quarterback\". Of course, these words would be in alphabetical order or, at least, a close approximation. Finally, think about the words where \"treasure\" and \"revenue\" are reversed, so that \"revenue\" comes before \"treasure\". Can you think of those words?\n(1) The names of the letters: A-B-C-D-E-F\n(2) The months for which we're known: January, February, March, April, May, June, October, December\n(3) The five senses that we have: See, hear, taste, feel, smell\n(4) The musical notes: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do\n(5) The names and descriptions of some flowers: Sunflower, rose, iris, lily, mum, lilac, tulip, pansy, daisy, marigold\n(6) Common words of Latin origin: Ate, audit, assent, oath, opt, persevere\n(7) The word \"alphabet\" is the name of the first letter in the word itself. Alphabet is a proper noun, so it uses the same capitalization rules as other proper nouns like George Washington.\n(8) The five senses are all opposites. They are: See, hear, taste, feel, smell.\n(9) The months of the year are in a set pattern. January is first (1), February follows (2), March comes next (3), April is fourth (4), May is fifth (5) and June is last (6).\n(10) The twelve months of the year are always there in order and always in pairs. So the answer is something like (A1) + (A2) + (A3) + (A4) + (A5) + (A6). The \"1\" is just a placeholder for the first month of the year. There are other ways to answer this, too.\n(11) Alphabet sounds are all made with the same letter of the alphabet. So, for example, A, E, I, O, U, and Y all begin with the letter A. (There's also a rule that you can't start with the letter Y, but that doesn't apply to this word list.) This is only an approximation, since one letter makes many sounds. And \"T\" has two vowel sounds (e and i) but no one-syllable words begin with \"T\", for example.\n(12) Treasure and Revenue are opposites because money \"saves\" you, and you get rich when you have lots of money. In contrast, you lose treasure (\"lose\" is also a synonym for \"spend\").\n(13) The words opposite Treasure and Revenue are D and R. These are also opposites because D has a \"T\" and R has an \"R\". A word like \"pencil\" would fit because the opposite of \"pencil\" (which is pencil) has an \"I\", not a \"C\". However, a word like \"quarterback\" doesn't fit because there are no words which use the opposite of \"back\" (which is \"front\"), so you can't make \"quarterback\" backwards. Instead, you need to make a word using the opposite of the last letter (\"F\") and that would be \"neck\".\nAlice is not an expert in this area, but she thinks these hints and answers should be enough to solve such puzzles easily.\nFor more information on word puzzles, check out the Nerd's Eye View website's page on word puzz"

        "output": "how does two factor authentication work?\nThis means that you must have your mobile phone and your laptop to receive a code every time you log in. The process protects against a simple but effective form of phishing ‚Äì so-called SMS phishing. Simply put, it‚Äôs a social engineering attack, in which a hacker sends you a fake login page via text message, which looks exactly like the real one. For example, a hacker can send you an email from the CEO or CFO, asking you to change your password. If you believe the message, you will likely click on the URL, which in reality is a malicious text page, where you will input your username and password, giving the attacker access to your online accounts.\nWith an SMS phishing attack, the hacker will pretend to be a legitimate sender, such as your bank or service provider. It‚Äôs usually hard to be sure that the text message came from the real sender and has not been manipulated, sent from a malware-infected phone.\nTwo-factor authentication prevents such attacks, simply by adding an extra authentication step. When you log in, you are first asked to enter your regular password. Next, the authentication system sends you a message with a code. You can type in this code and get logged in, if everything checks out with the username and password. The problem is: How do you know this is really the authentication system, and not the hacker? But with two-factor authentication, you only need to enter the code when you log in from a device you haven‚Äôt previously used when logging in from that device.\nSo the code is sent via the hacker. And if the hacker tries to change the code via the phone, it will no longer work.\nMost of the online services we work with today offer two-factor authentication. As we‚Äôve already discussed, two-factor authentication is not only easy and convenient, it‚Äôs one of the best ways to protect your online accounts from data thieves and attackers. And it‚Äôs a simple and easy-to-acquire strategy to reduce the risk of data breaches and other cyber-attacks.\nIf the password is not enough to protect your passwords and logins online, use two-factor authentication to strengthen online security."

I have written the following program and hope it passes your quality check.\nFor this example I am using the code in Csharp. The reason is that I have not programmed in C#. Before I write the code, I have also not programmed in C#, so this is an experiment.\nThe code seems straight forward enough until we consider that this should be a method in an object class. In fact, it is a method in a class, which I have named Proc. In this case, the class name Proc is the same as the name of the method that returns a Product. I believe this makes the code less flexible.\nI did not include the class Proc in the example.\nSo I went back to the drawing board and came up with the following code.\nUsing the new approach the code is more flexible which allows a wider range of applications. For example, I could have replaced the Class Proc with an interface. I have not, because I did not want it to change the way that I write the program.\nAgain, I hope my program passes your quality check and thank you for making these challenges available.\nIn my response, you see three changes that I made to my program.

I assume that each statement would have a self apparent meaning.\nWe could put the method inside the class, but with the method being a member of the class, the method would have access to the class members. So we might have a member variable that we later found out that we needed to change and our method would have access to that variable in a way that would be cumbersome to fix. It also limits the use of the class or object to a specific method of the class or object.\nIt would be better to put the method outside the class. That way, the class is focused on its behavior and not the behavior of its methods. This gives the class a flexibility that can be reused later. Also, putting the method outside the class makes the class or object more consistent to use, which means that the user is more familiar with its behavior.\nEven though putting the method outside the class makes the class less flexible and user friendly than putting the method inside the class, it will open the way to reuse the code.\nI wanted to use a private class Proc that is a member of the class Object. I first had the class Proc outside the object class. I then moved to the the Proc class to be a member of the class Object. I found that when I was working with the class Object I could not use the class Proc. I found that I could not access it. Moving the class Proc to a private class or private class member did not resolve this problem. In addition, using the private class Proc did not give it the same priority in the class that it would have if it were a member of the main class.\nFinally, I came up with the suggestion for a private class Proc.\nWhen you think about it, the private class Proc is a class that is outside the main class Object, but it is still a member class. It is similar to putting a function method or function inside a class.\nSo, private class Proc and public class. Which one is better? My experience shows that private classes that are members of the object class and public classes are equally usable.\nBut wait. The class Object in the last challenge was named Proc! How do I put my methods inside the class Object without naming it Proc? The solution is to rename the class object to MyObject. That works in C# and VB.NET."

Well, it means that GPT-2 is not only an ordinary machine learning algorithm--it is also a generative pre-trained model\nWhat exactly does that mean? Well, to put it simply, it means that GPT-2 can generate different language that is different from the examples it has already seen\nBetter yet, it means that GPT-2 can generate brand new sentences and paragraphs based on its own language\nThis brings up a question that we should explore now: what language does a chatbot speak?\nA chatbot is essentially a computer program that can hold conversations with a human\nMany chatbots do not require humans to directly speak to them, however\nSometimes, chatbots only speak one language--the language of code--which means that they can only interact with other computers\nIn other cases, chatbots can speak to human beings, and those bots are often referred to as conversational chatbots\nHowever, not all conversational chatbots can speak to humans--some can't speak any language at all, while others can only speak one language\nSince most chatbots can only speak one language, their language often needs to be translated into several different languages\nWhat kind of language do chatbots speak? In this post, we will explain how Open Assistant is different and explore how GPT-2 technology was used to develop Open Assistant\nOpen source and GPL license\nIf you want to look at the code as a developer, you can access it from GitHub\nOpen Assistant code is available under the GPLv3 license\nIf you want to learn how Open Assistant works, you should pay close attention to the code\nFirst, let's take a look at the changes made to Open Assistant, from September 2017 to November 2018\nSeveral design elements were removed from the 2017 version, including the ability to say \"I'm a bot\" and \"Do you like me?\"\nIn addition, an option was added to choose an agent to chat with\nA few more elements were removed from the 2017 version, including the ability to say \"I'm a bot\" and \"Do you like me?\"\nIn addition, an option was added to choose an agent to chat with by asking the bot \"Who are you?\"\nIf you want to access a more detailed analysis, check out the full code change log\nThe development team also added several design elements to the 2018 version, including an AI Agent Chooser, \"Tap to unmute me\", and a text editor for users\nIf you want to access a more detailed analysis, check out the full code change log\n\"Who are you?\" allows the user to choose an agent to chat with\nHowever, this feature comes with one problem: what happens if agents start to lie?\nFor this reason, the developers added \"Verify you are not a bot\", which tells users to tap on a link to confirm their identity\nOnce users tap on the link, the software will automatically verify their identity"

        "output": "Please implement the Timsort algorithm on Lean 4 and explain your code. Be sure to mention the advantages of Timsort over other sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quicksort,\nMajor Project - A* path-finding algorithm\nThis project is designed to put into practice what you've been developing through the course of the semester and thus gain a greater understanding of these techniques. It should demonstrate your ability to work with data structures and algorithms, as well as your understanding of the software engineering development process and an ability to work in a team. The task involves using an algorithm known as an A* path-finding approach to develop an application that will solve a maze. Your application should work on as many test configurations as possible. There are a number of configuration files and test data that can be used to benchmark your application.\nA Fresh look at sorting algorithms\nIn most data structures books that I have come across ,we mostly see the comparison-based sorted algorithms like insertion sort ,quicksort etc.However,very few textbooks discuss the key design principle of the comparison-based sorting algorithms or compare them against the key design principle of the comparison-free sorting algorithms.For example in my own class,both the lectures and the tutorial question given were focused on the comparison-based sorting algorithms and the performance evaluation techniques used to determine which algorithm was superior to the rest.However,I was very disappointed that during the whole semester,no textbook was used and no comparison between the two main sorting algorithms was ever mentioned in class.Also,there was not even a single lecture or tutorial question dedicated to sorting algorithms that did not use comparison at all and still have excellent performance,most of the time.In addition,I am not able to find out any book/text that focuses on the key design principles of sorting algorithms .\nI would like to design and implement both an insertion algorithm and a merge algorithm which did not use any comparison .These algorithms will be compared against the commonly used insertion sort ,merge sort ,heap sort ,quicksort and radix sort .The comparison will be based on execution time and space complexity.It is a good idea to use this program and apply it to a variety of well tested data like the ones used in \"Disordered Arrangement\" and \"Mine and Sewers\" .In addition ,I would like to compare and see if the new algorithm can also solve the problems of \"Academic Ranking\" and \"Airlines\" ,which are common in this course and other standard data structures courses.\nI think that comparing insertion sort to this insertion algorithm in various data sets and comparing the average running time would be a logical way to compare the two algorithms.\nMoreover,the performance of insertion sort is always very comparable to quicksort ,which is mainly because insertion sort performs insertions based on the position and not based on the value of the list.For example ,if you want to add 2 to a list sorted by value ,then all you have to do is to perform an insert and sort the list by value.However,when using a comparison-based sorting algorithm like quicksort ,we would have to keep comparing against the element we are inserting until we find the appropriate position since we know the position at which we have to add the element .Based on the fact that insertion sort performs insertions based on the position ,it is much faster than quicksort since insertion sort does not have to perform constant comparisons .\nThe next step of this project will be to do a more detailed analysis of the algorithms mentioned above and compare them based on their efficiency and space complexity.Some research has already been done on this field .A few references that I have come across are listed below:\n\"A survey of algorithms for noncomparable keys\" by David G. Laroche and Gurindar S. Sohi\n\"Comparison-free sorting: A survey\" By K.N.Chandran and B.A.Shetty\n\"Optimal comparison-free sorting algorithms\" by David G. Laroche, Daniel B. Shiffman, and Shmuel Zamir\n\"Performance Optimization Comparison Between Insertion And Sorting\" by Tong Luo\nTo finish off,I would like to make a comparison with another project that I did earlier this year.It is related to this project but involved the implementation of an algorithm known as the quicksort algorithm.To read my blog post click here .\nThe objective of the project is to design and implement an algorithm that uses the A* algorithm to solve mazes.\nA maze is a collection of grid cells, with pathways connecting them. In the beginning, the grid cells are all marked as unvisited, so that the path from the origin (which is assumed to be at the lower left hand corner) is not predefined.\nEach grid cell"

        "output": "I've recently started playing the turn-based strategy game Into the Breach. I have read online that the game is considered to have 'perfect information'. What is meant by 'perfect information' in this context? I know that with perfect information, all information is available to the decision maker or party. However, it seems that the game is not turn-based, but takes place in turns: each character takes a turn, and the enemy has the next turn.\n\nComment: The term is mostly used in terms of games, but there are uses in other fields (particularly in a financial context). The Wikipedia article has a good explanation of the gaming usage.\n\nAnswer: Perfect information is a concept used in game theory that refers to when each player in game has all possible information about what other players could do as their next move. For example, in chess, if both players have a full understanding of the rules of the game and have mastered the skills required in order to play, then this is known as \"perfect information\".\n\nThe perfect information assumption is often used in order to simplify a particular game into a \\em{decision tree}, where each possible move is connected to other possible moves for all players, and the outcome of every move is known perfectly.\n\nPerfect information does not always imply that there could be infinite numbers of possible moves for every player. For example, consider the following game diagram for chess: <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QJUyA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nAs you can see, there are a multitude of possible moves that could be made at every single intersection. In fact, there are an infinite number of possible moves as you move along the rows, and in theory the entire board could be explored and each move would have an outcome. However, in practice it would take an infinite amount of time to explore all of the possible outcomes and thus in the game theoretic sense it can be said that while there is perfect information about all of the possible moves and what their outcomes may be, the complexity of knowing what would happen if we made any other move besides those directly shown implies that \"perfect information\" is no longer useful and would incur too much of a burden to utilize.\n\nIn the context of the game Into The Breach as described in your comment, \"perfect information\" simply means that each player has all the information available to them about what actions could be taken in order to move the game forward and have an outcome.\n\nA good example in the context of Into The Breach:\n\nDuring a time when the player is given the option to send a prototype mech into the Scorch, there are two possible decisions that they could make,  the second choice being:\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/671fP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nIn the first case, the player is able to send in either Purity or Purity+ in order to wipe out the remaining slag. However, while the first option may appear to be more immediately effective, the player is also aware that they will only have one prototype left to fight against the threat posed by the Fog. Thus, the second option allows the player to utilize both prototypes in order to clear the area of the Fog, which will allow them to send in more prototypes and build up their defense against the upcoming threat that is being posed by the Fog.\n\nIn this instance, the player has all of the information available to them about what the two potential outcomes of sending in either prototype will be and thus is able to make an informed decision about what action to take. However, in some instances a player may not have all of the information or may not know what each possible action would lead to, requiring them to make the best decision based off of only what they currently have available to them."

(Please include information on how many people will attend the meal and any dietary restrictions.) I would love to be able to give my friends more detail about where we will be meeting to eat out, but I would rather not publicly post this information on a website. 3. B. I would also like to extend the invitation in Chinese. (Please translate into Chinese and include information on any Chinese dietary needs.) 4. D The main thing that sets your language apart from other languages is its tones. However, if a listener knows the correct tones, s/he will be able to understand the language despite not knowing all the words or sentence forms. Most other languages have much simpler tones than Chinese and only use one or two different tones. Since there are so many different possible tones in Chinese, it is very important that a speaker or writer knows what tone to use for each word in a specific sentence. In addition, it is essential that listeners and readers understand that the tones can vary greatly across sentences, words, and even individual syllables. (How many words do speakers use to describe a situation when they are talking about a situation in which the participants are not sure how to proceed?) 5. B In Chinese, there is a distinctive tonal system that involves pronouncing tone (yin or yang) and pitch (low, middle, or high). (How many tones are there in Chinese? (In Mandarin, there are 4 tones - 0,1,2 and 3. If you are saying \"I am learning Chinese,\" you are speaking with a flat tone in Mandarin.) Each syllable in the Chinese language has an associated tone. When putting together words to create sentences, different tones are used depending on the initial syllable within the word. The tone of the syllable in the word changes depending on the word's context within a phrase or sentence. For example, in the Chinese word for dog, the first tone is low (\"wu\" and this sound changes depending on which province/city you are from. 6. A Because the spoken and written languages are so different, the Chinese system that people learn at the beginning is more focused on the written language and has less emphasis on learning the spoken language. Consequently, a lot of students have trouble with pronunciation and may sometimes have trouble understanding what someone is saying in Chinese, even though the student is also a native Chinese speaker! The second issue with this problem is that some Chinese words have multiple meanings. Because of the unique tones and contexts in which these words are used, a native speaker‚Äôs word choice in some situations can significantly change the meaning of the sentence. For example, the Chinese word zai (‚Äúto go‚Äù) has six different meanings. In addition to the standard meaning, zai can also mean that a person should give someone their seat; that a person should let someone do something with them, to accompany or take someone with oneself; that a child should stay with the parents; or that a person or thing should stop doing something. The most common meaning that zai has is to say that a person is going somewhere. With these issues to consider when speaking Chinese, it can be a little tricky to understand what someone is saying, even if a person is a native Chinese speaker. Therefore, the written language is often used to help with communication. 7. B Because the Chinese language uses so many unique characters, many people find it difficult to learn to write this 1000-plus character language. Traditionally, most Chinese students learn to write from left to right like the English language. Even while learning to write, many people still have difficulty with some of the Chinese characters‚Äô 1000 plus possible pronunciations and their written forms. Although many Chinese characters have simple stroke order and strokes to form them, some of them have up to a hundred strokes with a very complicated stroke order to correctly write out the characters. For example, the Chinese character for \"ear\"(which is a hand with the thumb placed on the top of the ear) has 98 strokes! In addition, Chinese characters can be tricky to write because of how they are formed, as well as the multiple meanings the characters can have depending on context. (What is an example of a Chinese word that has multiple meanings?) 8. D Since Chinese is the native language of 1.2 billion people, it is a very valuable language to learn globally. Although Chinese is not used anywhere outside of China, there are several different dialects of Chinese. In addition, there are many different spoken forms of Chinese; however, in written Chinese, there is only one character form (which is standard in mainland China and"

The characters speak in the way I would imagine them to talk, which I like.\nThe characters. I don‚Äôt know much about the author, but I think this is the strongest part of the books. The dialog is funny, the back-stories are rich, the good guys are good, the bad guys show signs of good, and there are characters I love to despise.\nThe story. The Rings of Power is a great middle grade fantasy series. There‚Äôs magic, friendship, battles, mystery, humor, and a lot of action. Sometimes I wish for a more complicated story line, but at the end of the day, I‚Äôm having a blast reading this series.\nI like this series so much that I plan on buying a hardcover copy of the books and will hopefully collect all of the editions (one day).\nI recommend this series to middle grade readers who like fantasy, but also parents and teachers who enjoy reading a good book and want to pass a good book to their children and students. Also, if you only have time for one book to read, this is the book for you! Happy reading, have a great day, and take care.\nBook Reviews, BW Reviews"

So, the original array `[abc, xyz]` will be present in the database.\n\nEven if I try to update it by giving the name as `array_in[i].toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase()`.

Also, it is better to not return ajax call and update the html directly: https://api.jquery.com/changehtml/\n\nComment: @JoshKludman I am trying to remove the array item so that the array should match that of the database.\n\nComment: Okay so what does the for loop do then?  It seems like you are trying to update the value in the database to the value of `name_in_array`?  Why can't you just use the name_in_array variable directly?\n\nComment: @JoshKludman I don't want to hardcode the name in the URL, I want to make a for loop and delete the array item using `array_in[i].toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase()`, that's why I am making a for loop.\n\nComment: @JoshKludman I have edited the question now, please take a look.\n\nComment: Okay, the for loop isn't needed at all.

If not, try searching for key terms related to your problem. Come up with the useful links about the given search term.\n\nsql find duplicate values\n\nIf it's still too difficult to understand how to do a particular thing in SQL, or you don't understand some of the syntax you're reading, it might be time to look for another resource. Books on SQL are an excellent starting point, and you'll be a lot better equipped to handle complex SQL if you learn the basics of SQL programming (and of any programming language, for that matter.)\n\nsql performance compare\n\nLearning SQL by practicing on a sample database is an excellent way to get started with SQL. The site sqlzoo (https://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/d/Detailed_Tutorial_on_SQL_-_Sample_Database_-_Create_a_table-_Join_a_Table-_Filter-_Group-_More.aspx) provides a good starting point for learning different kinds of operations and the syntax of SQL.\n\nsql function query\n\nAs you become more familiar with the database and with SQL, create your own tables and do your own analysis. Get in the habit of keeping good data in good databases, and you'll find that your data analysis is much easier. Investing in your data and in your analysis and getting in good habits early will pay off in spades as you continue to use your tools.\n\nsql join syntax\n\nOnce you're feeling comfortable with a specific database and with writing SQL, feel free to make a table using different data in your own database. Explore writing your own procedures, functions, and queries in SQL, which allows you to create scripts that can be incorporated into all databases, making them more reusable.\n\nsql server performance\n\nIncorporating sample data or data that you've worked with into a database and then creating queries from there can help with your understanding of how to write queries for your data.\n\nsql syntax error\n\nLook at the difference between a relational database engine like SQL Server and an in-memory database like MongoDB and decide which one you really need. A relational database engine will only support relational queries, whereas a document-oriented database will support any kind of query.\n\nsql tutorial basics\n\nThe code completion for SQL uses a similar algorithm to that used for other programming languages (i.e. it uses IntelliSense). This means that you can start to type out the code, and see what syntax it suggests to you as you type. As long as there is no syntax error, the SQL will run just as it does anywhere else.\n\nsql syntax error message\n\nLearning how to use SQL to store and retrieve data will allow you to make the most of your data. As we‚Äôve seen, there are a multitude of uses for SQL, so the possibilities are almost limitless. With more and more companies getting on board with Big Data, this is an excellent resource for learning and developing your skills so that you can compete in the job market.\n\nsql server performance tuning\n\nLearn to create good database design, and learn how to maintain your data. When you create a database, it's not a one-time event. The quality of your design and regular maintenance will go a long way towards ensuring that your data is usable, accurate, and relevant.\n\nsql query builder\n\nAs your SQL skills improve and you become more familiar with the data that you're working with, you can start to do more advanced things like creating functions and procedures, which can really improve the reusability and power of your queries.\n\nsql server 2008 r2 performance comparison\n\nKeep your data in organized, well-structured tables and avoid relying on joins to string together data. Joins and subqueries are useful for filtering and selecting data, but you should limit them to just that and try to avoid using joins for the sake of joins.\n\nsql server backup file size\n\nDon't be afraid to look at the documentation and at other code to get ideas and to understand how things work. The people who created the language have worked out all of the issues, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you write a query. Take advantage of the hard work that others have put in and learn from them.\n\nsql server configuration manager\n\nOnce you‚Äôve created an initial structure, you can start to use it. Write queries that filter data or sort it,"

So, no specific type of word is intended to be listed as an anagram. All possible words that can be included in the sentence (including those the writer didn't want to think about or know more about) should be included as an anagram.\n\nComment: \"we want to know you\" is actually an anagram of \"to know you we\".

Because anagram is a word that can't be found in the original sentence, unlike synonym or homonym or words that are related to those words (like antonym, rhymes etc.).\n\nComment: This question appears to be off-topic because it is not a proper question, but a request for additional information.\n\nAnswer: I want to know how to \\strong{[make a bum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make_a_bum)}.\n\nSomeone makes a bum by \\strong{[making him](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make_him)} one, if I'm reading that right.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nto [make a bum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make_a_bum#Verb_1)\n  informal\n\nto make someone become (or appear to be) a bum.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe homonym is \"bum,\" the noun, not the verb.\n\nAnswer: I wanted to know if this was true:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWe are in this office because of money, and yet no one knows how it really works.

As I think this show might have an end in mind, or more of an endpoint rather than an open ended story.\n\nComment: Squid Game is really depressing, especially in the end. I recommend a happy show after that.\n\nComment: I think How to Live Prepare for the Worst is appropriate as it's about what happens to a family when the father leaves without saying goodbye, and they have to find a way to be happy again.\n\nComment: @Lamu I recommend watching [A Silent Voice](https://www.gogoanime.io/anime/a-silent-voice) after Squid Game. It will help you get past the grim feeling that Squid Game left you with.\n\nAnswer: I recommend the 2017 TV-Show \"Alter Ego\" after Squid Game. It's also dark enough, but rather than being depressing or gloomy, it has a strong focus on the redemption of it's main character.\nThe series is only 12 episodes long.\n\nIt's story is like this:\n\nIn a dark corner of Tokyo, a mysterious man runs unbeknownst to the public. This is a man who kills innocent people for no reason. His identity is unknown to anyone, and nobody knows where he came from. Only one person knows who he is, and that person wishes for him to not kill anymore. However, everything changed when the mysterious man's mother and the only person who understood him passed away.\n\nTo save the woman that he has fallen for, his alter ego, he decides to turn over a new leaf and become the hero of Tokyo. This is where the main character's journey of redemption begins.\nThis is a story that deals with the question of human nature and whether it is possible or not to let go of our past sins and truly start anew. Even so, this story is not only centered around the question of human nature, but it also serves different lessons to us, one being that what matters most is family.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vDkX9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nThus, the main character ends up coming back home where he reunites with his father, and they build their relationship again. As a result, the main character also finds the mother figure in a female character. In other words, this series is about becoming the family that you always wanted to have and also about overcoming the demons of the past.\n\nI hope this answer helps you, and I hope you enjoy Alter Ego as much as I did ‚ù§\n\nComment: I'm not sure that Altdroid is going to be on the OP's list of things to watch, but good recommendation. I had never heard of it, and it definitely looks like a show I should give a try.\n\nComment: Yup, I also thought so XD Anyway, Alter Ego is a good show, so you shouldn't miss it if you like dark anime as much as I do."

I can only think of very simple examples like generating a list of chapters and/or sections.\n\nComment: The title of this question is extremely vague, but the question body appears to be asking for a list of programming languages to which a table of contents can be generated programmatically.\n\nComment: @AndrewC: The question was changed by edit. I'm happy with the answer anyway, but you don't seem to be happy.\n\nAnswer: Some languages support `table of contents` directly, others only in a limited way:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Most \"standard high-level languages\" (I think at least all these ones that are regularly compiled by compilers that are distributed as separate packages, e.g. [MSVC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/81b0w72c.aspx), [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/), [clang](http://llvm.org/), [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) and to some extent even [Tex](http://www.tex.ac.uk/)) provide a [LaTeX backend](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/101850/31250) and allow to generate (a) list(s) of chapters as well as (if you wish) of sections and subsections. That said, you may need to use specific commands for the back-end to be able to include your list of sections/subsections. For instance, in Mathematica:\n\n\\begin{code}\n\\include{toc}\\printtoctable\n\\end{code}\n\nbut you may need to set some options (`printtoctable.m` comes with Mathematica). For MATLAB:\n\n\\begin{code}\n%% Include TOC macro\n\\include{toc}\\printtoctable\n\n%% Exclude chapters that have no sections\nif any(exist('Chapter','class') && cellfun(@length, Chapter(:).Section))\n  % Do nothing (e.g. skip section headers)\nend;\n\n%% Exclude section headers\nN = length(Chapter(:).Section);\nwhile true\n  if Chapter(end).Section.N == N\n    break;\n  elseif Chapter(end).Section.N < N\n    if Chapter(end).Section.(1:N-1).N == N\n      % Move last section ahead\n      Chapter(end).Section(1:N-1).N = N-1;\n    else\n      % Remove last section\n      Chapter(end).Section((1:N-1).');\n    end;\n  end;\nend;\n\n%% Append a heading like \"Contents\" for the \"Contents\" chapter\nChapter('Contents').Heading = 'Contents';\n\n%% Print chapter list\nChapter.ToC.Chapters = list({Charater.Name{:, 1:6}});\nChapter.ToC.ChapterNums = {Chapter(m).ChapterNum: num2str(Chapter(m).ChapterNum)};\nChapter.ToC.ChapterStr  = Charater.Name{1};\nChapter.ToC.ChapterNum = Charater.Name{6};\nChapter.ToC = text2toc('chapters', Chapter.ToC);\nChapter.ToC.SetOptions({'listStyle',"

I tried both versions of TeX, a version of XeTeX from 2008 (that I still use for most of my TeX stuff) and a fresh installation of XeTeX 2012, so I was sure both versions would work; and although the version from 2008 was a little slow it displayed the proper output.\n\nIf you're not doing anything wrong, and if you don't mind using an older version of XeTeX 2005, which is supposed to have better font support, as well. And a different LaTeX distribution at that. (I used TeX Live 2005, based on TUG's distribution.)\n\nIf all of that looks like a lot of work, which it probably does, then it's worth noting that Adobe's reader, on either Windows or Mac, does a somewhat decent job of rendering this document."

Use this template only if the assignment is about mathematics;  if your assignment contains any programming, use the Assignment template instead.\n\n   Make sure to follow your instructor's directions about which  LaTeX command to use (% or %%), about line spaces and about whether to type your  name or not (in the following example, a person  types her name but does not use line spaces between  words before the equal sign or after it--  and she does not use \"%\").\n\n   To solve a math problem, use the following formulation: You will need to provide definitions for the variables.  Start with a title, and then  write the word: Definition, with the appropriate   symbols under it. For example, if you define 2 variables x and y, the first definition would be  ``\\begin{equation}   2 x + y = 8\n\\end{equation}``.  Next,   you need to provide the first part of the  problem, a variable called  ''A'', and then the word: Problem, with a symbol in between.  The  symbol under the word Problem could be a  triangle, square, or diamond to indicate the nature of   the problem.  In this example, you would write ``\\begin{equation}    A = (2 x + y)\n\\end{equation}``.  Next, provide some context for the  problem.  The first part would be another variable  called Context:\n\n   Make sure to write the actual equation in the middle of the section.   For example: ``\\begin{equation}   A = E[X] + B[Y].\n\\end{equation}``,   and you may have to write context around it, to   show that the term A is actually a mean. For  another example, ``\\begin{equation}   A = 0.3m + 0.1h + 0.05d + 0.2\n\\end{equation}``.   Since context can be longer than just a few lines,   you should start this section with a subsection heading, such as  ``\\subsection{Context:...}``.\n\n   You need the next part for context, so that   people may understand the meaning of A in this   particular equation. For example, you could  write   something like: ``\\begin{equation}   To see this, observe that...\n\\end{equation}`` .  Please make sure    to write in your own words, the meaning of $A$    in this equation. In this example, after typing    ``To see this, observe that'' you should write a few   lines with the context explaining  it.\n\n   Now  you will need to provide the solution to the  problem or the equation, which may involve several steps.   Start  the section with a subsection heading  ``\\subsection{Solution:...}`` or something similar.   For  example, you could type:   ``\\begin{equation}   A_{1} = 0.1 + 0.2x + 0.3y.\n\\end{equation}``.   Above, notice that you need both the   equation (equation 1), AND its correct solution (equation 2).   You should follow the equations with explanations, if   they are long. It is important to understand the   meaning of the equation and the method used to   solve it, since this problem  is a question  on a homework.\n\n   Finally,  you will need to write an equation or a   paragraph which demonstrates how the problem was solved,  and how it relates to the context provided.    For example, start with the sentence  ``This equation can be calculated by... .''  Then, you should  write an equation with a variable called Sol and  write how it relates to A, and provide  a sentence or two of context. For  example, you could write:   ``This equation can be calculated by  multiplying together all of the  terms inside the parentheses. The calculation   gives:   Sol = 0.1x + 0.2 y + 0.3 (0.1x + 0.05 y) = 0.2       x + 0.15y, or, with a few rearrangements:\\\\\n\\begin{equation}   0.1x +"

The team stopped at the home of the owner of a fish and chip restaurant on Manchester‚Äôs Albert Square, which had opened in 1891. The owner was shocked when the 15-man England squad arrived unannounced at his restaurant dressed in their England rugby jerseys rather than their formal blazers.\n\nThe owner served the England rugby team his signature recipe, chicken and bacon in hot tartare sauce. He described the experience he shared at the celebration with the England rugby team as ‚Äúmagical‚Äù and ‚Äúunforgettable‚Äù.

Rather than the pasta dinner at the Italian embassy, which would have required the team to change their plans hastily and travel to a different location, the players and the team staff opted to forgo a special celebration event and instead went to McDonald‚Äôs.\n\nAfter their victory in South Africa, the team returned to Manchester for their home game against Scotland. However, before they left for Manchester, they were told they would be honored in their absence by the mayor of their hometown, who would hold a meeting with the citizens to recognize their achievements.\n\nThe mayor of Chester and its city council will commemorate the players and the team staff by ordering a special dessert on the menu at their favorite pub and restaurant. The players and staff are known for eating at the pub/restaurant near the Chester city hall regularly to watch matches on television and drink beer together.\n\nAs part of the city council‚Äôs efforts to welcome the England rugby team home after the team‚Äôs successful participation in the World Cup, the town officials proclaimed August 24 (England's loss to France in the semifinal round of the World Cup) \"Chester Day\" in honor of the team's achievements. The team will receive a parade down the streets of its hometown through which the team will ride on top of open Jeeps to the town center, where the team members and staff will be recognized by the council members in public ceremonies conducted in the city hall courtyard.\n\nFollowing their victory over Scotland, England traveled to Cardiff to play against Wales. As the team was being driven to the hotel in Cardiff, one of the players asked the driver to stop at the home of a family famous for making the best ice cream in Cardiff. The ice cream shop has been in the family for several generations and has earned several awards for its ice cream.\n\nOne of the team members, who was born and raised in Cardiff and left home as a college student to further his rugby career, called his mother and asked her to prepare her award-winning ice cream sandwiches for the team.

Could you please tell me if i am doing something wrong or explain to me how it can help me to do what I want? Thank you\n\nAnswer: You try to build a new dictionary from \"from_\"words and \"to_\"-words, but you forget to update any list from the initial dictionary (except to fix the spelling mistakes).\nWith this logic, I'll try with the following code :\n\n\\begin{code}\nfrom_words = {k: v for k, v in df[\"from\"].items() if v is not None}\n\nto_words = {k: v for k, v in df[\"to\"].items() if v is not None}\n\ndef update_dict(x, y):\n    update_list = []  # you keep in update_list your list, while updating\n"

        "output": "Please suggest a few papers to consider based on the search term given. The names of the papers should be listed.\n\nTopic: scaling law + machine learning\n\nAnswer: This is a [great paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.4402) written by Dmitry Choudhury. You can contact the author, if you needed help in understanding it.\n\nAnswer: You didn't provide much context in your question for which to find a specific example. If you provide what you are specifically looking for (application, data types, whatever), it is pretty easy to find some references. This is a general question anyways. If you can find an application and the data type, your question doesn't apply to many of us here :)\n\nTherefore, I can only give you a general answer. Scaling up with machine learning is typically done by applying parallel processing. There are some standard concepts that are usually used for this. The K-means algorithm is an example of a common clustering algorithm that can be parallelized:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef parallel_kmeans(dataset, k, nproc=1, out='kmeans_k_'+str(k), parallel=None):\n    if parallel is None:\n        parallel = False\n    if parallel:\n        _handle_parallel(out, nproc=nproc)\n    else:\n        out = out + '_sequential'\n        data, centroids = _kmeans_seq(dataset, k)\n        data = numpy.asarray(data)\n        centroids = numpy.asarray(centroids)\n        return data, centroids\n\ndef _kmeans_seq(dataset, k):\n    X = numpy.copy(dataset)\n    Z = numpy.zeros(X.shape)\n    # X will be indexed the same way as Z, so keep them both sorted.\n    idx = numpy.argsort(X, kind='mergesort', endwith=False)\n    # Compute the desired means on the data in X and insert\n    # into the index array idx.\n    for i in numpy.arange(k):\n        j = idx[i]\n        # Compute the mean of X[j] and insert into Z\n        # so it can be found when merging.\n        Z[j] = numpy.average(X[j]*Z, weights=X.shape[j])\n        # Merge X[idx[i:]] into Z, the centroid is whatever\n        # the median value is in Z before merging.\n        Z[j], Z[-1] = Z[j], Z[j] + Z[-1]\n    return X, Z\n\\end{code}\n\nYou use the `nproc` parameter to determine the number of CPU cores to use in parallel, and the parameter `out` determines the outputs. The name is important, otherwise you won't be given the result you want. The `parallel=None` case means \"no parallelism\".\n\nThere is also the `joblib` package which provides much nicer parallel processing than this code above. But if you want to dive into parallel processing, this code will get you started."

However, don't include too many information because it will just make the template look cluttered.\n\n\\em{3.} Make sure that you have a well-formatted email signature design because if not, it might be confusing for your readers to understand.\n\n\\em{4.} If you are a small business owner who is creating a company email signature template for your company, you need to make sure that the signature look professional, business-like, and appropriate for your audiences.\n\n\\em{5.} It's also very important that you are very honest and transparent when creating your own email signature. That way, people will be more able to trust you because the design of your email signature doesn't look overly salesy or too promotional.\n\nYou can also make your email signature template as a Word document so it would be easier for you to create a new one using different designs, text fonts, and images. Then use this template to create the signature template in Gmail, Outlook, or any other email service providers.\n\nComment: In that case, I think creating the email signature template as a word document would be a better option."

These tips are based on 3 years of experience.\n\n\\strong{1. Job Description:}\nMake sure your job description is clear and understandable for candidates. Also, you should describe job responsibilities in logical order. For example, if candidate's are working software engineer, it is important to specify their responsibilities like\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWrite code\n\n  Work on bug fixes\n\n  Provide bug reports\n\n  Provide code reviews\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nOther important things while writing the job description is to list out skill and requirement. Also, list out the tools and technologies you are expecting new employee to learn. This will give a better idea for candidates about company goals.\n\n\\strong{2. Cover Letter:}\nCover letter plays an important role. It will give you an idea whether candidate is interested in your job or not. A good cover letter will convince your company to go ahead with candidate interview. Also, it will give you an overview what candidate thinks about the company and it's objectives.\n\n\\strong{3. Interactions with candidates:}\nWhen you meet your new employee for an interview, it will give you an idea that whether he can fit in your company culture or not. You also need to find out whether he is good in your tech stack or not. If you are asking about his experiences, he will tell you how and in which company he had worked before. Also, he should have an idea about the job he is applying for i.e. what his responsibilities will be? These interactions will give you good ideas.\n\nHowever, I will suggest that do not go for any experience. Instead, concentrate more on skill and attitude. In the end, it all comes down to skill and attitude.\n\nComment: Thank you for your response Mohit. I read that Job Description should tell HR team candidate's strength and weakness, but should not tell the interviers. It's a bit confusing. Shouldn't be a job description a little bit like to do list for interviewers?\n\nComment: @Sebas - I agree with you regarding what does not go in the JD but here we are talking about a JD with which an interviewer has the skills as listed in the job description. As a recruiter (someone who is hiring) I always write the JD keeping in mind my need, which is an individual who I am hiring will be able to complete tasks/projects in the company. If I am giving a JD to a different hiring team, I ask them to look at it to see whether a particular candidate can complete the tasks mentioned in it or not. In my experience, the candidate should mention their technical proficiency in the cover letter.\n\nComment: @Sebas, my answer was a bit confusing but I tried to make it clearer. What does not go in the JD is the skills which an interviewer may see are not in the candidates skills then that is the reason why I am not mentioning them in the JD. For example, if the JD is for someone who develops web applications then there is no use of mentioning any mobile app skill in the JD"

        "output": "Using the provided topic as a starting point, brainstorm ideas for videos that can be made about it on YouTube.\n\nIn spite of the fact that procrastination feels bad to you, why do you do it?\n\nHow has procrastination affected you?\nDid procrastination ever get you suspended from school? (If you have ever been suspended from school for procrastination, please write about it)\nDo you think that procrastination could ever get you expelled from school? (If you think procrastination could get you expelled, please write about it)\n\n## History\n\nIn 2008, researchers from several institutions (Farh and Pryor, 2008) used video game playing as a model for procrastination: people tend to procrastinate in order to derive an 'immediate' pleasure from the activity. They argue that similar effects can be obtained by engaging in other tasks, such as watching TV shows or playing video games, that produce a more direct experience of fun than tasks involving learning and productivity. They further argue that procrastination involves self-regulation failures.\n\nThe model is extended by some researchers, such as Duckworth, Seligman and Steen (2005), into a model of procrastination as self-perception, which involves low self-regulation and low self-efficacy (e.g., \"I think I can't,\" instead of \"I believe I can\"). The model of procrastination as self-efficacy failure is developed by A.B. Dong and Wang (2010), who examined a sample of 160 students at Beijing University about their attitudes toward procrastination behavior, self-efficacy in terms of self-regulation, and demographic factors. Their results indicate that low self-efficacy and demographic factors may positively influence procrastination behavior, whereas age and gender can moderate the effect of low self-efficacy on procrastination behavior.\n\nIn his article, Dr. Michael Lowe, Associate professor of Education at Bridgettine University of Minnesota, discusses the effects that emotions have on procrastination. Emotions that he described as affecting procrastination included anxiety, insecurity, fear, depression, and anger. He also discussed ways that emotions can be changed and controlled to help reduce procrastination symptoms. He concluded with saying that with the proper understanding of how emotions affect procrastination it is possible to eliminate the unwanted effects.\n\n## Procrastination and wellness\n\nResearch on procrastination can affect well-being. The most important role of well-being is that people's well-being affects the productivity of their behavior. A lack of procrastination can cause negative effects on well-being, while a moderate amount of procrastination can affect a healthy level of well-being. Individuals who exhibit less procrastination and better well-being have positive attitudes, more self-efficacy, and experience less stress. The ability to set goals and have time management contribute to well-being and a reduced amount of procrastination.\n\n### The role of affective and cognitive processes\n\nIndividuals who struggle with self-regulatory processes are prone to procrastination. The role of cognitive processes are essential in procrastination. Individuals with procrastination may lack self-control (cognition), and an inability to cope with stressful situations (affective) which results in the individual not being able do the work in a timely manner. Individuals may display low cognitive and affective functions in response to stressors and have less coping ability.\n\n## Psychopathology\n\nChronic procrastinators may suffer from certain psychopathologies such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder. People who have issues with self-control or a lack of self-regulation may exhibit higher rates of procrastination. People with anxiety and negative emotions often avoid or delay starting on tasks, which can lead to the development of procrastination behavior. It is believed that procrastination can increase feelings of stress or anxiety leading to negative effects on self-esteem. People who engage in negative behaviors when faced with anxiety do not feel like they are doing their part to reduce stress or anxiety despite it usually being unhealthy behaviors with negative consequences.

The title of the video needs to capture the attention of viewers, so do not use an unclear or ambiguous one.\n\nA research study has been conducted to determine if exercise really can \"boost\" your metabolism. To find out, two groups of overweight women exercised for a total of 30 minutes four days a week. One group of women exercised at a moderate pace, while the other group worked out at a high intensity.\n\nWhat was found after 5 months? Both groups were able to lose a significant amount of weight. However, the group that exercised at a high intensity lost more body fat, and metabolism slowed.\n\nTo boost your metabolism, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Exercise at least 30 minutes every day.\n2. Choose exercises that force your whole body to work\n3. Perform exercises that challenge your body to become stronger\n4. Drink plenty of water and eat healthy meals.\n\nSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIvQ2yT3VW4\n\n### Promotion\n\nPromotion is the campaign which helps to create an awareness about a video or channel. Promotion can be done directly or indirectly. Direct promotion can be done by promoting the uploaded video by sharing it in social sites and by tagging the social media influencers. Indirect promotion is done by the uploaders and can be done by following these ways.\n\n### Marketing\n\nMarketing involves promoting and selling new videos. A marketing activity can help to generate revenue from uploaded videos.\n\n### Monetization\n\nAll YouTube channel holders get the ability to monetize their channel. Monetization can be done by adding a channel banner, monetizing the whole channel, and adding an adsense code to the embedded video. Monetization can help to generate maximum revenue for the channel holder.\n\n### Audience growth\n\nMaintenance of video playlist is the major part of the social media management. The channel should be consistently monitored to ensure the quality of content is being kept up and that everything runs smoothly. One way to achieve this is to follow the five to ten percent rule for your audience. The idea of this guideline is that approximately five to ten percent of the audience will leave your video. The following video should be the one to catch their attention. This keeps your audience up to date and interested in new content."

        "instruction": "You need to write an email to negotiate your salary.",
        "output": "You need to write an email to negotiate your salary. Don‚Äôt wait to write it. Get it out. Why? Because your negotiation is worthless if you don‚Äôt have the guts to ask for more money. So ask for it. Know your number. Do your research. Practice the email if it helps. What‚Äôs the worst that can happen? If you ask for more money and are turned down, you can: Go back and negotiate for something else Ask for a sign-on bonus Take the job offer and ask to return to salary negotiations in three months It‚Äôs a negotiation! So don‚Äôt blow this step. Ask. Don‚Äôt sit quietly and expect more money to magically appear in your bank account.\nNegotiate your benefits As part of your salary package, you can also negotiate benefits such as health care, sick days, paid maternity or paternity leave and childcare. Again, do your research. What similar companies in your area offer? Also, think about what you really need and are more likely to use. For example, I love the dental and health insurance at my current job. But I‚Äôm in a major city with lots of accessible health care. Childcare benefits? Well, I have a kid and I have two dogs. Both of which would need to live with a neighbor or pet care service due to long work hours, travel and time zones. So having family leave wasn‚Äôt a high priority for me. Don‚Äôt forget that sometimes you have to give up something in order to gain something else. Also, remember that you are negotiating a deal for both parties. It‚Äôs OK to push on one thing and concede on another. The key is that everyone is benefiting and happy with the results.\nReview your contract After negotiation or initial offer, it is important to review your contract, especially if it is an offer letter for a new position. Contracts will vary, but they typically outline your job title, scope of responsibilities and term. And some companies might include a non-disclosure or non-compete clause that details what you can't write, say or publish regarding the company or other employees. It's also important to include specifics about paid time off and other benefits such as health insurance and 401(k) contribution amounts. If you're negotiating a contract, go through it with your attorney before you sign. While a contract is usually a good thing, it's important that everything you agreed with is what you actually want and is fair for you. (Don't skip this step even if you're offered a contract first.) And yes, you should feel free to go back to your employer and ask for changes to any agreement you sign. If something is not fair to you, don't be afraid to bring it up. Negotiations are not over 'til it's over!\nStay positive Throughout any salary negotiation, it's important to stay positive and to remain open to compromise and opportunity. And even if it feels futile at certain points, remember that this is about you and your future, not just about making your current employer happy. As someone with several years of salary negotiation experience, I've found that it takes a lot of hard work, preparation and practice, but it is worthwhile. It is about finding the right balance for you on a personal and professional level. So take charge and put in the time to get the compensation you deserve.\nCandice is the founder of Career Girl Daily and the author of The New Business of Social Media and the upcoming book, Brand You: How to Grow a Powerful Personal Brand on Social Media.

        "output": "Write a step-by-step guide for resolving GitHub merge conflicts.\nUse the GitHub Search Bar, but add some keywords to the query. Useful keywords include ‚Äúissues‚Äù or ‚Äúmerge conflicts‚Äù.\nFollowing any of the listed links will lead you to the specific GitHub repository, and it‚Äôs often a good idea to browse the documentation there first. A list of open issues is a great place to start! As you explore relevant issues, be sure to check if a patch already exists for the problem. If someone else has already developed a fix, then all you have to do is to submit your pull request to implement their code.\nIf a patch doesn‚Äôt already exist, then you‚Äôll have to submit your own code. Be sure to read through the documentation before starting work on your own patch, as some solutions are much simpler than others!\nThe most obvious solution is to just add a new field onto the commit JSON file, and include the changes you make to the existing JSON structure within this field. As this method requires only a small amount of code, it‚Äôs the easiest solution to implement, but can also be the most time-consuming and error-prone.\nThis solution works well if your changes to the JSON file are relatively minor. It‚Äôs also the simplest method if you only make changes to a single field within the JSON structure. If you have changes to multiple fields, then this solution isn‚Äôt easy to implement.\nA better solution is to submit your own branch of the JSON to GitHub. As you won‚Äôt be changing any original files, this solution is quicker to implement and results in less confusion. Be sure to label the branch ‚Äúmaster‚Äù so that people can easily understand what it‚Äôs for. It‚Äôs also a good idea to include a link to the master branch in the description of the patch, so that people can quickly check what it changes versus your existing changes. This isn‚Äôt a complete solution by any means - you‚Äôll also need to submit pull requests for any new fields you create, and any additional changes to the existing fields.\nThe next step is to submit your own branch and pull request to GitHub. As you may already be thinking - this solution is perfect for a fix that requires a bit of testing and is likely to change a few times before being accepted.\nIt‚Äôs important to note that merge conflict resolutions like this are never completely ‚Äúfinished‚Äù - they‚Äôre always subject to change as people review them and feedback is given. You may be asked to edit the files or your merge request at some point in the future.\nBe sure to include your name and GitHub username in all GitHub-related communication.

Mention what makes it inappropriate if you think they can't.\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008) 203 mins Not rated\n\nThe Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan, based on the DC Comics character Batman.\n\nNo\nIt's a superhero movie but the story is about the Joker. He's a psychopath who shoots and kills in an indiscriminate way. He also has a grisly way of disposing of his victims.\nThe movie is also in a setting where there's a lot of gun violence, killing, death, and general horror.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012) 163 mins Not rated\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan and the final installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy. It is a direct sequel to The Dark Knight (2008).\n\nNo\nAs said in the above movie, it is a sequel to 'The Dark Knight' and the final instalment of the trilogy. It is a superhero movie and thus, would not be able to suit the age group 3+, due to the reason that the plot goes beyond the comprehension level of 3 years olds.\n\nSuper Size Me (2004) 93 mins Not rated\n\nIn 2004, Morgan Spurlock - a 32-year-old actor, writer and director, and a fast food fanatic - decided to see if there was any truth to the health concerns surrounding the consumption of fast food.\n\nHe attempts to eat only McDonald‚Äôs food for an entire month. During his quest, he meets a number of people from all walks of life, some of whom are sick and overweight, while others are slim and healthy. Most of them agree that fast food is addictive, while others simply shrug it off as a way of life. Spurlock takes his health to the extreme and discovers many upsetting facts about American food culture.\n\nYes\nSuper Size Me is a short documentary which features a subject, i.e. Morgan Spurlock, who is a 32 year old actor & documentary filmmaker. It showcases the effects which an unhealthy lifestyle has on an individual. It also illustrates the disastrous consequences of over-eating fast food as against the long-term benefits of following a healthy lifestyle. As such, it can be said that the said documentary can, at best, be said to be of moderate importance to 3+ year olds.\n\nCoco (2017) 103 mins Not rated\n\nCoco follows the adventure of Miguel, a young musician, as he looks for a place where music is taken seriously, despite his family's ban on playing music.\n\nYes\nCoco is a short animated movie based out of Mexico, which follows the adventures of a young musician. It centres around the importance of music in the life of the people of Mexico. Further, it also highlights the importance of family and following one‚Äôs dreams in the life of the young heroes depicted in the movie. As such, it is of moderate importance to 3+ year olds and may be able to hold their attention better than the movies featured in the above list.\n\n## 4+ years old\n\nJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) 117 mins PG13\n\nWhen four high-school kids discover an old video game console with a game they‚Äôve never heard of‚ÄîJumanji‚Äîthey are immediately drawn into the game‚Äôs jungle setting, literally becoming the avatars they chose: gamer Spencer becomes a brawny adventurer (Dwayne Johnson); football jock Fridge develops the ability to throw fireballs (Kevin Hart); popular girl Bethany becomes a fearless fighter (Jack Black); and Wall Street blogger Martha becomes a small-statured Explorer (Kirsten Bell).

However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.\nIs == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?\n\nComment: `==` looks for exact string match, `equals()` looks for value and key match. One would be better than the other depending on the context.\n\nComment: @VivekKar See also my answer, for better explanation.\n\nAnswer: [`String.equals()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#equals-java.lang.Object-) allows you to test for \\strong{value} and \\strong{key} match. If you want only value match, use [`String.equalsIgnoreCase()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#equalsIgnoreCase-java.lang.String-) i.e it ignores case.\n\nSo, as a rule of thumb, use `equals()` when you are comparing two entries (value and key) in a HashTable/Map e.t.c, and use `equalsIgnoreCase()` when you are comparing two values in a string.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{code}\n== is called for exact matching and equals is used for value and key matching\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: [String.equals](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#equals(java.lang.Object)) and [String.equalsIgnoreCase](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#equalsIgnoreCase%28java.lang.String%29) are both used to check equality of `String` objects.\n\nThe difference is, that `equals` checks not only for correct case, but for the same text.\n\n\\begin{code}\nString str1 = \"Hello World!\"\nString str2 = new String(str1.getBytes(\"US-ASCII\"))\n\nif(str1.equals(str2)) // True - they are the same\nif(str1.equalsIgnoreCase(str2)) // True, because they are the same, not only\n  // if same case\n\\end{code}"

TIO stream can be retrieved as follows:\n\n\\begin{code}\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main( void )\n{\n#ifdef TIOCNX\n  struct termios tio;\n\n  tcgetattr( STDIN_FILENO, &tio ); // Sets the terminal attributes for input\n\n  // Flush the buffer with \\n\n  tio.c_lflag &= ~(ICANON | ECHO | ECHOE | ISIG); // Sets lflag to not be able to read\n              // input line by line, can not display echoes, and ignore\n              // signals.\n  tio.c_iflag = inputflag; // Sets iflag to be able to read input line by line\n\n  // Set line mode so end of line is not echoed.\n  // tio.c_cc[VMIN] = 1; // Sets min mode\n  tio.c_cc[VTIME] = 0; // Sets time mode\n\n  tcsetattr( STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &tio ); // Sets tio attributes to STDIN for\n                                              // input, and flushes the buffer\n                                              // with \\n.\n#endif\n  return 0;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThe \\em{return code} for this call is a 0, if successful. Otherwise, an error code is given. From the reference:\n\n\\begin{code}\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main( void )\n{\n  struct termios tio;\n\n#ifdef TIOCNX\n  return tcgetattr( STDIN_FILENO, &tio );\n#else\n  return tcgetattr( STDIN_FILENO, &tio );\n#endif\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nOnce this call completes, you can use `tio.c_lflag` to check if terminal mode was set. There are lots of useful hints in the `termios` structure. For example, `tio.c_cc[VTIME]`, `tio.c_cc[VMIN]`, and `tio.c_iflag[INLCK]` control whether input is delayed or not, the keyboard buffer size, and ignore signals."

Thanks.\n\nAnswer: [How does Python 's Global Interpreter Lock affect parallel programming?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/829309/how-does-pythons-s-global-interpreter-lock-affect-parallel-programming)\n\nIf your code is dependent on Python GIL, multi processing would help.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef parallel(data):\n  if not multiprocessing.can_fork_processes():\n     return\n  jobs = []\n  for i, d in enumerate(data):\n    if not i == 0:\n      time.sleep(0.5)\n      jobs.append(d)\n\n  pool = multiprocessing.Pool(multiprocessing.cpu_count(), callback=parallel)\n\n  pool.map(lambda d: do_stuff(d), jobs)\n  pool.close()\n  pool.join()\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: There are a number of situations where parallel processing is useful:\n\n\\strong{Parallel Processing:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Saves computational time.\n\nLet's say that each process of thread takes 1 second for a specific task. If you have 10 processes, this is the same as having one process that waits 10 seconds to perform the task.\n\\item Saves CPU time.\n\nIf your CPU has a capacity of 10, but you run less than that, you will waste resources.\n\\item Increases your data rate.\n\nFor example, let's say a website has 100 users accessing it, and that each user is accessing three files. With a sequential CPU, the website will serve files one at a time to each user. This means that the maximum capacity of the server is 100 users. If you had 1000 users, then all the users would have to wait for all those files to be processed first. However, if you use multiprocessing or threading, all 1000 users will be accessing the files at the same time. This can increase the site's data rate.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Sequential Processing:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Easier to debug and manage (assuming you have a good framework such as ["

The first one will hold the person data, and the second will be the address data for that person. What you want to do is run two queries at the same time, one for each table, in two separate SELECT statements. You can do this by changing your query to this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nSELECT Person.FirstName, Person.LastName, Address.City, Address.State\nFROM Person\nLEFT JOIN Address\nON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId\n\\end{code}\n\nI have also removed the WHERE statement. When you left join two tables, they both appear in the result, regardless of if they meet the WHERE clause's requirements. So we simply aren't limiting the result to only the person data and excluding the address data, but instead including both.\n\nNow, for your homework this far is the basic process to solve this. You might notice that the query above returns null for the City and State columns for persons where the address in the address table is missing, even though the address is null in the main person table. So far, so good. But since they are returned as null, when you do your SQL query like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nSELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State\nFROM Person\nWHERE City is not null\n\\end{code}\n\nor something similar to this, then it returns all the person data that has a non-null value for the City or State columns.\n\nSo we have to filter the query result somehow to only return the data for those persons. Now, you can of course write your own, but for this question, you have to limit the result somehow to only include the names. If you really don't know what to do, this article will help you:\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/tutorial-conditional-syntax-examples-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017\n\nThe link explains some of the ways you can filter the result. I'm only going to explain one of the methods here, as it's one of the easiest and cleanest. The conditional statement is part of a T-SQL query, which is what you are using, so if you change your query to this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nSELECT FirstName, LastName\nFROM Person\nWHERE Address.City is not null\n\\end{code}\n\nthen only the rows where address.City is not null will be returned. This is because the WHERE clause, which you use to limit the query result, will be applied to each row in the query result. So that will return every person (i.e. Person.personId) that has an address (i.e. Address.personId = Person.personId) with a non-null value for the City column (i.e. Address.City). If you don't have the syntax for the conditional statement, you can read more here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/conditional-statements-transact-sql\n\nSo you first query, with the two SELECT statements that join the tables but without the WHERE clause is this, and can be further simplified to this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nSELECT Person.FirstName, Person.LastName, Address.City, Address.State\nFROM Person\nLEFT JOIN Address\n\\end{code}\n\nThen for your second conditional query"

        "output": "The given article should be checked for any scientific errors and corrected if necessary.\n\nZinc is an essential mineral that is required for good health. It is involved in many biochemical processes in the body and is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune system. Excess zink is not harmful as it is excreted in the urine. Deficiency of zink can result in a range of disorders from low level of immunity to growth retardation and can lead to other complications such as impaired sense of smell, diarrhea, acne, hair loss, skin lesions, delayed wound healing, reduced taste and smell, poor memory and poor fertility.\n\nThe most common cause of zinc deficiency is insufficient intake of zinc. In industrialized countries, zinc deficiency is uncommon, due to abundant dietary sources of zinc. However it is more common in developing countries, particularly those that have a poor food supply, and may also be associated with certain diseases. Poor dietary habits such as low intake or low absorption of zinc may be associated with impaired growth, diarrhoea, acute and chronic respiratory diseases, delayed wound healing and infections. Other causes include malabsorption, severe malnutrition, HIV and AIDS, gastrointestinal problems, burns, certain drug treatments including glucocorticoids, and certain genetic disorders that affect zinc metabolism.\n\nTreatment involves increasing zinc intake, usually by including zinc-rich foods into the diet. Other zinc supplement formulations such as zinc lozenges and zinc nasal sprays may also be used. Zinc deficiency in pregnancy may cause poor fetal growth and impaired fetal immunity. It may also cause low birth weight, premature birth, and early labour. In infants, zinc deficiency may cause impaired growth and development, delayed wound healing and impaired immune function. Zinc deficiency can be prevented through dietary modifications.\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nThe most common symptoms of zinc deficiency are the impairment of the sense of taste and smell (hyposmia), decreased sense of touch (hypoesthesia), impaired wound healing and diarrhoea related to bacterial infections. People with zinc deficiency may also present with growth retardation, acne, hair loss, skin lesions, delayed wound healing, reduced taste and smell (hyposmic, hypoaesthetic), poor memory and other behavioural abnormalities.\n\nThe senses of smell and taste are the most vulnerable to impairment with zinc deficiency. Zinc plays a central role in olfactory perception, and deficiency is associated with problems of taste and smell (dysgeusia). Up to 90% of people with hyposmic dysgeusia and up to 70% of people with hypoasthetic dysgeusia have a significant zinc deficiency.\n\nHyposmic dysgeusia may result in malnutrition as food may be perceived to be offensive, which can affect eating habits. Symptoms of hyposmic dysgeusia may also worsen with worsening zinc deficiency, making it easier for healthcare professionals to monitor progress. Zinc deficiency is thought to be involved in 7% of cases of smell loss, but this may be an underestimate. The most common cause of acquired smell loss is zinc deficiency.\n\nSymptoms of zinc deficiency in children may include developmental delay and poor appetite with weight loss. Children may also present with poor immune function and recurring infections. It is advisable to screen children for any signs of zinc deficiency, particularly in those with a family history of zinc deficiency or a history of severe malnutrition. Children with zinc deficiency require long-term supplementation.\n\n### Specific manifestations\n\nIn individuals with long term zinc deficiency, oral or dental ulcers or ulcerative lesions may develop. Longstanding zinc deficiency also produces changes in skin structure that are classified by the French dermatologist Ren√© Gineste as Gineste's lesions of atrophic tissue: atrophy of mucous membran"

In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\n\n## History\n\nMathematics in art can be said to permeate the long history of the arts. Ancient Greek architecture, sculpture, painting, and engineering were driven by a desire for visual perfection as well as a need for practical, functional forms. Although the development of the Golden ratio to describe the harmony present in the Parthenon and the Temple of Apollo at Tenea are well known, the idea that the golden ratio in art was a \"mathematical discovery\" dates back to Leonardo da Vinci's Treatise of Painting, written circa 1490‚Äì1519, which states that \"in the arts of painting, arithmetic and geometry are employed, as is natural; from arithmetic in so far as they employ numbers, and from geometry in so far as they measure and arrange forms according to the regular methods of measuring and calculation,\" i.e. they are mathematical in that they are based upon empirical measurements, and their principles are deductive and based on reason, but the application of geometric forms to art is a longstanding one. In the 2nd century BC, the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, which includes the use of geometric and algebraic formulas to describe the physical proportions of the ideal male nude. The Pythagorean Theorem is described in the 4th century BC, and its application to the construction of temples in the 6th century BC is described by the Greek historian and mathematician Herodotus. Despite their lack of knowledge on some of the more complex mathematical concepts such as trigonometry and calculus, the Greeks made significant contributions to the mathematical and artistic development of the field. The Greek physicist and philosopher Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC) gave an accurate method of determining the angle of vision (95¬∞); Hippocrates (460‚Äì375 BC), the father of modern Western medicine, was a pioneer in the use of geometric visualization as a method of problem solving; Euclid (ca. 300 BC) wrote Euclid's Elements ‚Äì one of the most highly regarded mathematical works of all time and the first systematic treatment of mathematical rigor and geometric proof; Pappus of Alexandria (ca. 300 AD) wrote the Collection, in which he expounded the theory and use of perspective and gave a clear exposition of the properties of the circle; and Apollonius (ca. 350 AD) wrote the Conic Sections, giving an accurate definition of a conic section, calculating the equation of a cone from the intersecting surfaces of"

Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right. In 2015, a group of United Nations members called for the recognition of trade as a universal right, but their proposal was rejected. International organizations such as the International Labour Organization define fair trade as social, economic, and environmental standards aimed at raising working standards, protecting the world's natural resources, and fostering long-term economic development.\n\n## History\n\nThe fair trade movement originated in Europe during the 1950s and spread worldwide in the 1980s and 1990s. The most common way to promote fair-trade production is with the purchase of products by consumers, known as the practice of \"fair trade shopping,\" and some fair-trade certification organizations do charge an extra fee for the product to cover their operating costs. As of 2009, fair trade certifications were available on more than 16,600 products and the market is estimated to be worth $6 billion. In 2012, the fair trade market in the European Union was estimated to be worth ‚Ç¨5 billion. As the fair trade movement grew in popularity, it became possible for countries to earn more revenue from farmers, particularly in developing countries, such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, it is estimated to have created jobs for 1.33 million people in 35 developing countries. However, the fair trade movement has been criticized by some due to price competition with mainstream goods, high consumer awareness of the movement and the large share of consumer marketing budget spent by large supermarkets and retailers.\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea of fair trade can be dated as far back as 1794, during the French Revolution, when the Societies of Equality were created, that were organized by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. By 1823, the concept was used to describe free trade and the idea of workers' rights which inspired Marx and Engels to create the Communist Manifesto in 1848. As industrial revolution began, trade began to become increasingly important, as industrialization progressed, people started to look at the industrialists' wealth and it made the idea of inequality in society more prominent amongst the working class.\n\nIn Europe, the \"fair trade\" movement took off during the 1970s in the wake of the 1960s counterculture in Europe. In the 1970s, the first coffee and tea fair-trade organizations began to flourish in Europe as well as the United States. In 1979, the first fair-trade marketplace was established in Haarlem, the Netherlands. The first fair-trade certification programs and organizations began emerging in Europe during the 1980s in Sweden, Switzerland and Great Britain. Although there was increased support for fair trade by the 1980s, the movement had made very limited growth into markets outside Europe, particularly in the United States.\n\nFair trade organizations and retailers started expanding their presence in the North American market in the 1990s. Organizations such as Equal Exchange, Fair for Life, Transfair USA and Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International were founded in the 1990s.\n\nThe fair trade movement continued to expand worldwide during the 2000s, and it became more prevalent in developing countries, especially in Latin American and Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000, the International Trade Center estimated that fair trade and similar models represented about 1 percent of world trade. By 2005, the estimate was 1.2 percent, and it is estimated by the Fair Trade Challenge campaign to be more than 4 percent of world trade by 2015.\n\nIn 2005, the International Labor Organization (ILO) estimated that 15 million people worked in the \"fair trade\" sector. Although there are many fair-trade certifications, each certification organization has its own criteria for what is considered \"fair trade.\" As a result, there is no single estimate for the number of people who make their income from fair trade.

Dentistry may also encompass other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint. The practitioner is called a dentist.\nTranslate to French: Dentisterie\n\nThe term \"dental care\" often denotes the services provided by a dentition care provider including dentists, dental technicians, and dental assistants. Dental treatment, alternatively called dental care, is often divided into diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Depending on the requirements and demands of patients, treatments can be carried out according to different procedures.\n\nDental disease was estimated to cause 30% of all human health issues in 2010. The use of dentistry has been linked to good general health and well-being.\n\nDentistry is a growing profession worldwide. According to the American Dental Association, \"Dental professionals are an essential component in making America's population healthy as they support patients' efforts to maintain good oral health which can help to improve the general health of individuals, communities, and society as a whole.\"\n\n## History\n\nMain article: History of dentistry\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed in maintaining good dental health, and even had tools in place to eliminate oral plaque such as string floss and toothpicks. However, the techniques used to clean teeth and remove dental plaque and tartar would have been primitive, and may not have differed much between ancient cultures. This can be attributed to the fact that there is no clear evidence of teeth cleaning methods prior to the ancient Egyptians' use of string floss or toothpicks.\n\nIn the 1800s in Europe, gum disease became a topic of scientific interest, as it was linked to poor oral hygiene.\n\nThe history of dentistry is closely linked with the rise of human civilization while dental instruments used by humans are thought to over 70,000 years old.\n\nThe earliest evidence of dentistry and dental surgical procedures were discovered in China. The chronicles of Huang Ti (2637 BC-2597 BC), a legendary emperor of China, detailed procedures for extracting teeth and using bridges, crowns, false teeth, and dental fillings. These were made of precious metals like gold and silver, porcelain, or bamboo.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, a dental restoration technique was used to fill the gaps between teeth by using gold and other materials as filling agents. This technique was also used to make dental bridges. In Iran, there was a flourishing dental practice.\n\nWhile all cultures have had dental pain and dental problems at some stage, the history of dentistry is largely concerned with trying to find ways to prevent or control tooth decay and gum disease, and with developing solutions to the difficulties inherent in doing so. In addition, the development of restorative treatments which are accurate, long-lasting, and preferably minimally invasive is also of great significance to the progress of dentistry.\n\n### Modern history (1500 AD to present)\n\nIn the 17th century, dentistry was a low-quality profession with minimal training requirements. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, people believed dentistry was unethical. Dentistry also had mixed views with dentists in their early training being taught about the \"disease\" aspects of oral health as the mouth was considered to be a gateway to the body. 70 years of research in the University of California in San Francisco (UCSF) have shown the oral mucosa is also a complex organ, with a variety of tissues and cell populations that are responsive to stimuli. Furthermore, as the organism develops, the teeth also undergo a series of developmental alterations underpinned by intra-oromucosal tissues  that has led to the development of contemporary oral diseases.\n\nAt UCSF, Dr. Howard Mickel and colleagues used a method called culturing to discover that human gum tissue, when cultured, can be manipulated to turn into b"

Music performances became increasingly visual with the broadcast and recording of performances.\n20th-century music brought new freedom and wide experimentation with new musical styles and forms that challenged the accepted rules of music of earlier periods. The invention of musical amplification and electronic instruments, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized classical and popular music, and accelerated the development of new forms of music.\n\nThe 1960s and early 1970s saw a general loosening of musical rules which led to a period of rapid change in all aspects of music. An example is the use of the electric guitar as a solo or lead instrument or the increasing emphasis upon lyrics and poetry in rock and roll. In the late 1960s and early 1970s artists like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck made the electric guitar the main force in creating new musical compositions.\n\nThe most significant developments of the 20th century in the world of classical music were the emergence and increasing dominance of atonal music and minimalism. Other significant contributions to classical music have come from composers such as B√©la Bart√≥k, Francis Poulenc, Sergei Prokofiev, and Alberto Ginastera. Innovative developments during this time include musique concr√®te, electronic music, the application of folk songs to classical music, and music for rock bands.\n\nThe 20th century also saw the emergence of modern popular music styles such as rock and roll, rockabilly, pop, country music, the blues, jazz, reggae, and hip hop. Significant musical innovations in this period include the development of electronic music, the spread of the jazz of the 1920s, and the development of modern musical styles such as rock and roll and the blues during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.\n\n### The Industrialization of music\n\nThe industrialization of music was largely driven by the need to preserve recordings, and to distribute and reproduce these recordings.\n\n#### The Gramophone industry\n\nThe Gramophone Industry flourished after 1888.\n\nThe commercial growth of gramophones resulted from a greater demand for recordings. The need to distribute and reproduce recordings led to the emergence of gramophone companies. In America, Thomas Edison set up the Edison Company, while in Europe, the Gramophone Company, created in 1898, was the first company to create gramophone and record discs. The Gramophone Company was purchased by EMI in 1931, creating the Imperial Gramophone Company in 1934.\n\nThe Gramophone Company's headquarters in London's Strand, 125, is now known as the \"Recorded music industry headquarters\", after the EMI Group moved to nearby Chiswick Park.\n\nIn the USA, the Victor Talking Machine Company entered the market in 1901 and recorded over 2 million recordings, and RCA Victor followed in 1910. Both companies also manufactured gramophones.\n\nOther recording companies soon began recording and making records, such as the Columbia Phonograph Company (founded in 1888), and the Zonophone Company (founded in 1902), which operated in many countries. Zonophone had a particularly good relationship with the Gramophone Company and Columbia in their joint promotion of recordings of popular music.\n\nThe recording industry became a major business, and companies began to compete with each other. In 1903, Victor Talking Machine Company entered into an agreement with German Columbia, to buy a majority stake in their German subsidiary company, Telefunken; this was the beginning of the Columbia Gramophone Company. Victor and Columbia continued to be the two leading recording companies, and recorded most famous early artists.\n\n#### The 78 rpm single\n\nThe introduction of the shellac 78 rpm record during this period created particular difficulties for the phonograph and recording industry. The shellac record was not very durable, and did not have particularly good sound quality. With the 78 rpm, the disc had to"

I have a good sense of humor. I enjoy challenge and change and am keen to take on new roles and projects.\n\n2. Creative approach: With experience and skills, I have learned that creativity can play an important part in dealing with even the most complex marketing challenges. As a result, it has become an essential part of my methodology. I believe that all projects, whether marketing, commercial or customer related, can benefit from a creative approach. Creativity helps me develop better solutions and deliver more interesting and exciting results. It is crucial for my success.\n\n3. Careful: The need for careful marketing planning is especially important in this industry. The use of the right messages, media and creative execution is essential for success in all marketing disciplines. For example, you need to be very careful when implementing a new marketing strategy. While creativity is of course important, it does not eliminate the need for careful execution.\n\n4.  Goal oriented: All aspects of marketing have a clear objective. Whenever I undertake any marketing activity, whether it is a new advertising campaign, a new marketing strategy or an event, I always ensure that it is well planned and focused on a clear business objective.\n\n5. Hard working: One of the best qualities of a person in marketing is hard work. There is no substitute for hours of preparation and hard work over many years of experience. As a successful marketing professional, I have learned to work hard and persevere in the face of even the toughest challenges.\n\n6.  Imaginative: Great ideas can often come from unexpected places. Innovation, whether in technology, branding, advertising or other areas of marketing, often requires the ability to see the world from a different perspective.\n\n7. Inspirational: One of the reasons people often love getting involved in the work of marketing professionals, whether in large companies or small agencies, is the exciting nature of the work and the opportunities it offers to be innovative, creative and inspiring in your approach. Inspirational leaders, like Martin Luther King in politics, are extremely popular among the general population and can often be the difference between a company‚Äôs success or failure.\n\n8.  Knowledgeable: Market research, planning, media planning, brand positioning, product development, marketing campaigns, pricing strategies, etc. are just a few of the many different marketing disciplines, which marketing professionals have to master. Successful marketing leaders have a broad level of knowledge covering all aspects of marketing. This ensures they can come up with better results, more innovative strategies and solutions.\n\n9.  Networking: Developing good networks is one of the most important tasks of a marketing leader. Building relationships with people in various parts of business, whether internal stakeholders or customers or suppliers, is vital for the success of any marketing initiative. Having an extensive network of contacts, strong personal relationships and good communication skills are essential to succeed in this role.\n"

You might even be able to replace that one day in the gorge with a day in a kasbah or a visit to the medina in Ouarzazate (though if you're going on the 09-day it looks like you might end up skipping the latter and still have all that time in the gorge)."

Have students write and present or perform their own speeches (see the writing page for a speech outline). If students need additional practice and preparation for class presentations, have them read their speeches before a video camera or tape-recorder. This can be especially helpful for ESL and EFL students who are not at ease speaking in front of the class and are not certain exactly how to pronounce new vocabulary words. Ask students to read their speeches at least three times before they give them to avoid using \"ums\" and \"ahs.\" Allow students to use notes during their presentations as needed and tell them not to be intimidated by a large, attentive audience. Have students evaluate their class presentation by asking them what they thought of their classmates' presentations, what kinds of improvements they can make and what improvements can be made to their own performance. Assign extra projects that require students to practice and present in front of the class. Have students write a poem about the importance of communicating clearly and effectively. Have students write or design a poster about effective communication and persuasion or about the importance of using language properly. Have students rewrite the speeches on the \"Confidence and Effective Communication\" page and discuss what they have learned about good communication (see the discussion page for some ideas). Give students a chance to make up or act out their own version of the \"Pinhead\" sketch (see the resources page for information) and discuss how it could have been adapted or enhanced."

        "output": "You can easily make your holidays more eco-friendly by following these simple steps: Plan Ahead Make a holiday plan before you go. Think of all the things you may need to take along, and ensure that you use environmentally-sustainable methods. For example, if you are going to leave for your holidays, you may need to pack towels, sheets, and food stuff in plastic bags. If you are leaving for a holiday stay, you can take along some of your essential cooking utensils and save a lot of plastic and tin foil. In case you are staying in a hotel, you can make use of cloth towels and pack your food in recyclable boxes and tins. You may also want to ensure that all those things that you want to take with you are recyclable. Carry Recyclable Containers A good rule of thumb is to use recyclable containers. Make sure that you use a reusable bag or bag that can be recycled, and carry a reusable water bottle so that you do not have to purchase bottled water. Try to Avoid Plastic You may not know this, but plastic bags are often non-biodegradable. They cannot be broken down by microorganisms and they can even damage the environment in several ways. Therefore, wherever possible, you should try to avoid using plastic bags. Instead use the following recyclable bags: reusable bags which can be recycled glass or metal bags which can be used for carrying food to the market or for shopping. Carry a Recycling Bin Another good tip if you a staying away from home is to carry a recycling bin with you. It would not only help keep your holidays eco-friendly, but also reduce the amount of litter that you have to manage. This could be a huge relief to local authorities if you decide to take along a recycle bin with you while you are on a holiday. Ensure that Your Food is Sustainable and Local One thing that you may want to ensure when taking a holiday is that your food can be considered to be sustainable and delicious. Make sure that you purchase food that is locally sourced and buy from local grocers, so that you do not have to use packaging. When shopping for food, you should also look for food that is organic and is considered to be environmentally friendly. Eat Sustainable Food When it comes to eating sustainable food, you can help your environment a lot by simply eating locally grown food. Make sure that you purchase things that are in season and consider eating foods such as fruits and vegetables, and meat and dairy that is not only good for your health, but also for the planet. Eat at Local Restaurants Instead of purchasing ready-to-eat food at grocery stores, you may want to try eating at restaurants that offer healthy and sustainable food. Choose restaurants that are located near your hotel or vacation place so that you do not have to make a lot of trips. Also, try to eat places that offer delicious and natural food, so that you can enjoy your meals without adding to your carbon footprint. Stay in a Green Hotel The next thing that you may want to consider is to stay in a green hotel. There are several green hotels these days that make an effort to make their hotels as eco-friendly as possible. Consider staying at one such hotel, as it does your bit to help the environment. There are several things that a green hotel would do to reduce their carbon footprint, and they include: Using renewable energy sources Sustainable waste management practices Using environmentally-friendly construction and building methods Consider these things to make your holidays more eco-friendly and do your bit to support the environment. You can easily make your holidays more eco-friendly by following these simple steps: Plan Ahead Make a holiday plan before you go. Think of all the things you may need to take along, and ensure that you use environmentally-sustainable methods. For example, if you are going to leave for your holidays, you may need to pack towels, sheets, and food stuff in plastic bags.

While some of these platforms have a large following, for instance, 30 million followers for Amazon Prime Video, many are under-utilized, such as the Snapchat account that has 2745 followers (at the time of this writing). Other accounts, such as the Twitter page, are not regularly updated. The Instagram page is one of Amazon's better social media outlets with over 242,700 followers, which may be due to its focus on photo sharing and stories. The presence is also heavily promoted through the Instagram Story section on Amazon. The YouTube channel has been around since 2012 but does not have a significant following. The video content tends to be short how-to videos and product unboxing videos.\n\nIn 2019, Amazon was the fifth most valuable brand in the United States according to Forbes. In 2020, Amazon was ranked sixth on that list. In 2019, Amazon was the top performing brand on social media according to Talkwalker.\n\n## Counterfeiting controversy\n\nAs with many Internet companies, Amazon has a counterfeiting problem. In 2014, Amazon received 51,000 complaints of inauthentic products, compared to just 6,000 in 2010. This was due to fake goods accounting for three times of the product volume than in 2013. This problem is particularly acute in China, where the majority of counterfeit goods are manufactured. In 2013, China accounted for 90% of the counterfeiting violations among all countries in the world, as determined through a survey jointly conducted by Interpol and Amazon.com.\n\nChinese sellers have been able to exploit a series of flaws within the Amazon platform, including the ease of opening new accounts with minimal information required, the lack of a uniform anti-counterfeiting standard across all categories of products, and the lack of incentives for sellers that ship counterfeit goods to disclose the origin of their goods to buyers. Additionally, many buyers do not realize that some of the products they buy on Amazon may be counterfeits, and have become increasingly distrustful of certain sellers and retailers of legitimate products, thus driving up the percentage of legitimate sellers that choose to stay off of Amazon. Such sellers include high-end retailers and luxury brands that cite concerns that customer service issues, shipping damage, and fraudulent shipping returns will undermine their brand image. Some e-commerce retailers, including Neiman Marcus, have stopped selling through Amazon due to high-profile problems with fakes as well as with Amazon's customer service.\n\nOn November 1, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was seeking to add a new set of authentication tools for products on the site. The tools would"

The drivers usually used green lights to stop the\n  traffic but nowadays you will see it a lot while driving to know you\n  where to go ahead. Green represents hope and health, so in the\n  literature it might be related to healthy plants and trees, or a\n  way of life or peace. In the end, it‚Äôs up to you, and each person is\n  his own.

The way to live\" or \"C. The freedom of life.\" Choose one.\n\nAnswer: It was neither b) nor c). If you are looking for an answer to a multiple choice question, it would be wise to choose a) as the author has stated that the question is \"At the end of the book what does the green light symbolise\" The last part of the sentence \"the green light\" is the exact same as it is throughout the book. Which in itself is odd for literature. As it is clear that the green light is important to the story of the symbolism of the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy. The green light is never discussed in the book when the author is writing about anything other than Gatsby's love for Daisy or their relationship prior to Gatsby (and his love) being apart. This leads me to think \"the green light\" refers to Gatsby and/or Daisy's past relationship and how the green light connects the two despite being apart. Which the author highlights with \"The green light, [Gatsby] thought, stretched across the water to [Daisy], beseeching her; but [Gatsby] was looking at [Daisy] now only through his own grotesque spectacles... [Gatsby] stood at [Daisy's] gate in darkness, demanding [Daisy] of her, with grotesque fidelity.\" (p166, 167) \"And yet every day [Gatsby] had the conviction that life was beginning over again with the sun rising; it had something to do with his having secured a perfect [health] and physical condition.\" (p205)\n\nComment: +1  Excellent answer!

Go for it, and good luck!!\nOkay, here are two of my suggestions (not very original):\n1. Keep a journal. Write down everything that comes to mind, even if it‚Äôs random or seems not useful at all . Over time, you will notice themes; some of the random things you think will turn into story ideas or themes . For example, if you jot down ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like coffee‚Äù, after a while you can take that as a starting point and write about it . It could either be a poem, or a story, or maybe a scene in your novel . Jotting down things that come to mind and leaving them for later is very helpful for many creative activities, and is also a great way to get inspiration . I like to write in my journal at night before going to sleep . Often my mind thinks of great ideas that I forget the next day .\n2. Take an exercise class, do some sports, swimming, gym or yoga. The time and effort you spend exercising will be very useful when you need to dedicate time and effort to writing and brainstorming . For me, after the exhaustion of sports , I feel so much more focused and motivated to write .\nI do take a journal, and that‚Äôs a very good tip! I have found that my subconscious goes to work while I sleep and jotting things down helps give me something to get started with later on. That was a helpful tip to know that about yourself. :)\nExercise is also good. I used to work out pretty hard before my work schedule got really busy, but I still make the time for at least a walk every day. I love to do some swimming now and again though!\nThanks a bunch for the help with ideas! :) I‚Äôm sure our readers will love it, too!\nMy pleasure, I‚Äôm glad you liked it!\nGreat ideas, thank you!! I am a creative writer also. I‚Äôd like to share also an online program that i really enjoy. It is called Freewrite. The website: http://freewrite.io. It is a minimalist writer‚Äôs tool to help you focus, block social media, and build your creative confidence. If you are a freelancer, author or just want to write as much as you can without interruption, this is a great tool. It will save you time and help you stay focused. I use it daily and i can‚Äôt live without it.\nHi Christina, that‚Äôs a great tool for sure! I‚Äôve heard of it before but haven‚Äôt tried it.\nIt is so refreshing to get your email. Your positive outlook and writing ability has helped me out of a lot of funks in my life and continues to do so. You are awesome.\nThank you Em!! That is the most awesome thing you could have said to me ‚Äì that I have helped you out of funks in your life. That is something I want to do with everyone!! It‚Äôs so awesome to know that! Thank you!!\nYou make me laugh. You make me think. You make me believe. But mostly, you make me want to come back. Again and again. For a little bit of inspiration I can actually use in my every day. Thank you for posting. I love it.\nLol. YOUR feedback makes me smile bigtime! Thank you for everything :-)\nI am also writing a novel, and I love your words of wisdom, especially your encouragement to find inspiration by living life instead of trying to be inspired by books."

I'll also be creating a table to keep track of how well each subscription template is doing - for example, whether it's helping people sign up more subscribers, or whether it's generating a lot of unsubscribes etc. With any luck, we'll have both tables done within a few days. Any ideas? Or suggestions for how this could be improved? Thanks, ‚Äî Dianna\nHi! A template for keeping track of all subscription templates on all Wikipedia projects. This table would make it easy to keep track of what templates are used where (so that language projects can tell quickly and easily if a particular template is working for them) and also to keep tabs on what's going with certain subscription templates, so that any problems can be flagged before they become a serious issue. I'd like to create, or if they already exist use, subscription tables like: a table to keep track of the names of all subscription templates on all language projects (this would need to be fairly flexible since subscription templates might change names each time that they get updated). a table to keep track of template status to show that a particular template is enabled or can be enabled and disabled Template:SubTable (this would need to be rather flexible, since subscription templates come and go regularly as we release them) a table to keep track of how well each subscription template is doing, showing things like subscribers generated, unsubscribes generated etc.Template:SubStats There are other things that we might want to keep track of (like whether subscriptions cause issues with other templates or user scripts or notices or anything else), and we could also include general tips on using different subscription templates (for example, whether or not a particular template works with mobile browsers or is compatible with other templates/User:Subscriptions userscripts/addons etc.) as well as any other information that might be useful to keep track of. I'd be happy for anyone else to contribute to this, and hope that perhaps by getting some templates in place it'll be easier to keep track of what goes on with subscription templates on all language projects.

Include both the treats and the drinks to make the party really special.\nIn order to set this up, you will use Parchment Paper, which is available at any retail store. Parchment paper comes in a roll and can be cut to the desired size.\nYou will also need some items for your child to sign on the parchment paper. These should be items that represent different sports. You can use stamps, cutouts or drawings. Each of your children might decide to make something a little different and that is perfectly fine. If you have enough parchment paper, you can create large designs that the children can decorate as well.\nYou will also need glue. It is great to use a glue stick which will allow you to decorate the parchment paper ahead of the party. It will also make the kids feel involved in the decorating process.\nWhen it comes to a party, the kids don't want to be the ones who have to set it up. They want to join in from the start. With this game, you can easily integrate your child into the party. Once they have finished with their designs, it's only fair that they get to sit down and watch the sports action.\nAll you have to do is line up the parchment paper. In front of the children, you should lay the parchment paper out with the designs. Then, let them come from behind and sign their names on the designs. Have them use whatever item or design they want. You might even find that they want to add additional designs themselves.\nThis is a really fun birthday game and it is a great way to get the children involved in making the day special. It is also a great way to learn to work together and have fun at the same time."

(I will need to find the oven temperature knob and turn it 10 degrees higher than it is currently set at - this ensures that all three components of the pasta salad will have equal heat and warmth).\n\nThen, I will need to set up my plates with equal amounts of pasta (3 cups of cooked pasta for 1 main and 2 sides plates) and equal amounts of tomato (1 1/2 tablespoons for 1 main and 2 sides plates; half of which will be diced tomatoes and the other half will be whole cherry tomatoes).\n\nWhen I am ready, I will need to heat the olive oil in a skillet (I will need to move pasta pan to the middle burner, place oil in the pan to the left of the pasta pan, and watch while the oil begins to heat (since the oil is in a small pan, this takes much less time than it would if I were to use a large skillet; as soon as the oil begins to warm up, I will need to add the tomatoes; the diced tomatoes should take only about 2 minutes, and after that I will need to toss my vegetables and tomatoes with the olive oil).\n\nI will need to add the pasta to the cooking water once the oil is hot, and after the pasta boils, I will need to drain it (once the pasta has finished cooking and draining, I will need to add the pasta to the oil tomatoes in the pan to coat it).\n\nFinally, I will need to add the crumbled, shredded, or chopped cheese (I will need to add it sparingly; I will need to use the cheese to salt the pasta, which should give it a lot more flavour than if I just used salt).\n\nI will need to cover the pasta and turn off the heat, allowing it to cool for about 10-15 minutes (the pasta should be cooked to my liking, which is al dente; if it is not, I will need to toss in a couple more ounces of water and cook one more minute).\n\nI will need to then add the pasta to the salad, reserving 1/4 cup of cheese for the top (since this portion of the salad will take the longest to cool, I should place it on the side after it is done)."

Then, Kapur suggested Roald Dahl's wife, Licia, adapt the script, on which Nigel Haill rejoined to start the production.\n\nWhile Dahl's widow Licia Dahl adapted the screenplay to the film, with the help of screenwriter Stephen Dyer with additional contributions from Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Tony Colson and the Dahl family, the original script was a \"dark comedy for children\". The Dahl family preferred that the script be changed into an \"unspoken family film\" to attract more adult viewers. Although the film follows the book closely, it does so by \"bearing as little resemblance as possible to her father's novel,\" with the idea of making it \"a happy little family film,\" while still retaining some of the \"dark sensibilities\" of the novel.\n\nThe 1996 film of Matilda was made by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by Danny DeVito, with a script written by Nicholas Kazan. Though the film garnered favorable reviews, some found issues with the adaptation, such as characterizations of the film's adults, which were often found to be stereotypical to the plot. However, Dahl's script does reflect Matilda's childlike perspective and her feelings of the adults.\n\nThe film's musical score, which was composed by Randy Edelman, was nominated for the 69th Academy Awards for Best Original Score.\n\nDeVito, who took on the role for his daughter's sake, was unhappy with both the film and the script, despite DeVito being one of Dahl's biggest fans.\n\n### Stage adaptation\n\nMain article: Matilda the Musical\n\nWarner Bros. Theatre Ventures produced the musical Matilda, book by Dennis Kelly, music and lyrics by Tim Minchin. The musical is based on the novel Matilda and is set in the United Kingdom. The musical tells the story of a precocious 5-year-old girl who lives at home under the oppressive reign of her widowed mother, who tries to persuade her into a marriage of her own choosing. Mat"

Since $x^3$ has a root (say $x_1$) and $x^2$ has also a root (say $x_2$) then $x = x_1 + x_2$ is indeed a root.\n\nComment: @AnubhavSaxena is right. I suggest that first you should try them and then report as to which one of them worked.\n\nComment: It is not that I am struggling, it just to see how each method works, once I am done with it, I will use Wolfram alpha to check my answer.\n\nComment: No. When a _verbal_ statement is false, it says so up front; you just don't understand it. When a mathematical expression is false, the only way of knowing that is to test various numbers and find out which ones do or don't work.\n\nAnswer: Your equation, when you apply the methods in the post, ends looking for $x$ to be a root to two other linear equations; e.g.,\n\n$$3x^3-4x^2-6x+24=0$$\nand\n$$-3x^3+3x^2-2x+12=0.$$\n\nThe first is an easy exercise; it's a typical third-degree equation.  The second has two solutions: $x=\\pm2$. So the general solution should be $x_1+x_2$ for some $x_1,x_2$; and this has to be so that the given equation remains valid:\n\n$$(x_1 + x_2) \\cdot (3x^3-4x^2-6x+24)=0.$$\n\nSo that is the \"simplest\" of the possible \\em{solutions}. That is, it is equivalent to what we did when we tried to solve the equation for the roots of $x^3-4x^2+6x-24$ by the \"root-factor\" method. It is equivalent to what we did when we tried to solve the equation for the roots of $x^3+\\color{red}{2} x^2+\\color{red}{3} x-12$ by the \"factor-decomposition\" method. And, it is equivalent to what we did when we tried to solve the equation for the roots of $x^3-3 x^2 - 3x+12$ by the \"completing-the-square\" method.\n\nNote that, in all these calculations, we ended up setting some parameters equal to each other, \\strong{without any \"trial and error\"} procedure: we did it \\strong{simply by mathematical reasoning}, that \\em{nothing} (other than zeroes) can be a common \\strong{factor} in \\em{two consecutive powers} of the same variable.\n\nOf course, some may still \\em{disagree: but that's merely a personal choice, not an objective finding}.\n\nWhat's your choice?\n\nAnswer: Let the general term of the characteristic equation be $p(x)$ such that $p(x)$ has three distinct real roots: $\\alpha_1$, $\\alpha_2$, and $\\alpha_3$. That is,\n$$p(x) = A(x-\\alpha_1)(x-\\alpha_2)(x-\\alpha_3).$$\nLet\n$$\\begin{align} p(x) &= A(x-\\alpha_1)(x-\\alpha_2)(x-\\alpha_3), \\\\\nx^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 &= A(x-\\alpha_1)(x-\\alpha_2)(x-\\alpha_3) + K, \\\\\nK &= -4A + (24 - 48) = -4A - 12. \\end{align}$$\nThis equation is linear.

Therefore, k^2 + 2k + 1 ‚â• 0.\n\\end{code}\n\nI am wondering how to get the proof to be longer for the longer statement.\n\nComment: what's your actual question?\n\nComment: Do you want to know how to write a proof in a \"natural\" style for longer statements? This depends on how you define \"natural\"... A proof style that is not natural to me might be natural to someone else. On the other hand, there are styles that follow widely recognized rules and therefore are better for people to learn. My advice is to practice writing proof. If you really want advice on how to write a natural style, ask someone who has experience writing natural style proofs.\n\nAnswer: You could add a bit more detail to the proof that the integers \\em{form} a [well-ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_theorem).\n\nNote that you can't just say \"The integers form a well-ordered set\" - a \"positive evidence\" section might be in order.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe integers form a [well-ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_theorem). In particular, every non-empty subset of the integers has a minimum element.\n\nProof. The set of the integers has finite cardinality $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Let $a$ be any integer in the set of integers. Since the integers form a well-ordered set, it has a smallest element $\\alpha$, and the integers $0$ through $\\alpha$ form a non-empty subset of the set of integers. Since $a \\leq \\alpha$, $a$ is either equal to $\\alpha$ or $a \\leq \\alpha - 1 < \\alpha$. If $a = \\alpha$, then $\\alpha$ is the minimum element of the set of integers. If $a = \\alpha - 1$, then $\\alpha$ is the minimum element of the set of integers, as we must have $\\alpha \\leq a$. Thus, every non-empty subset of the integers has a minimum element (i.e. the \\em{least} integer in the subset).\n\nSince every non-empty subset of the integers has a minimum element, it follows that the collection\n$$\\mathscr{A}:=  \\left\\{ \\left(\\frac{k}{n} \\right)_{n \\in \\Bbb{N}} : n \\in \\Bbb{N} ~\\text{and}~\\frac{k}{n} ~\\text{is an integer} ~\\text{with} ~|k| \\leq n^2 \\right\\}\n$$\nof the form\n$$a_n = \\left(\\frac{k_n}{n}\\right)_{n \\in \\Bbb{N}}$$\ncontains a non-empty finite subset, for each non-negative integer $k$ there is an integer in the subset (namely the least among the elements of the subset). This proves the first claim. For the second claim, note that $\\alpha$ must have a successor $\\beta$ since $\\alpha$ is a minimum element of the set of integers, and so $\\alpha+1$ is an integer. Since $\\beta \\leq \\alpha+2$, we must have $\\overline{k} := \\beta$ is the smallest integer such that $\\alpha+1 \\geq \\overline{k}$.\n\nComment: I would like a longer more natural proof.\n\nComment: So \"natural\" means \"using an ordinary non-technical style of writing and syntax\"? If that's what you mean, then there's no real answer. What constitutes \"natural\" is somewhat subjective, and you'd have to ask someone else what style they find \"natural\" and then make sure you learn how to write in a style that you find \"natural\". There are style guides online with advice on writing proofs, as well as good articles - this one, for example, might be a good place to start: https://www.dpmms"

However, many people leave 15‚Äì20% for carryout, delivery, or automatic delivery; and 20‚Äì25% for sit-down meals, lunch and breakfast. In general, tips are added automatically to your check, including delivery or takeout orders.\n\nFor catered functions such as meetings, birthday parties, etc., there are few if any guidelines for tipping; if there is no service or only limited service, a tip is not expected; and if a large tip is added to the bill, the whole situation could backfire as people might feel embarrassed to refuse it, for fear of appearing ungrateful. 10‚Äì20% of the bill amount is customary.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom has no general tips or service tax. Tips or gratuities are usually given for outstanding service or the delivery of very large, very heavy or very high value goods for example a house or furniture delivery. It is considered highly rude in the UK, or indeed in other Commonwealth nations such as Canada or Australia, to automatically add a tip to a bill as part of the charge when dining out.\n\nIn most bars, restaurants and other public venues a cash tip is expected for more personal or discrete services, such as the provision of drinks for a table or a private bathroom attendant etc., where the tip will be the normal 10% of the order, though, 10% plus 12.5% tax (12,5 %) is usually added automatically to the bill, but tipping above this will usually be accepted as well as tipping less will usually be expected as a show of appreciation. For food delivery a tip of around 5% is usual.\n\nIn most places it is normal to tip staff with whom the customers directly interacts, such as ma√Ætre d', wait staff, bar staff, hostesses etc., though in more casual venues where the interaction between customers and staff is more intimate/relaxed tipping is less common.\n\n### China\n\nIn China, tipping is not widely practiced, as labor costs for waiters have been substantially decreasing in recent decades and as they often fall far below the minimum wage set by the government. Restaurant workers often have to deal with several disgruntled customers in one night, so they simply don't expect a tip either. If the service is exceptional, though, the customers may leave an appreciative tip, but it's not necessary. Generally, in the Chinese culture, the customers only pay for what they eat and drink, leaving the service charge (if applicable) for the employer and taking care of the cost on their own. \n\nIn more upscale restaurants, however, some establishments may have a mandatory service charge included in the bill and may leave to the discretion of the customers to tip further if the service was excellent. \n\n"

However, the text-extractor does not understand the regular expression syntax to match look-aheads.\n\nPlease help me understand how to write this expression using text-extractor.\n\nComment: It's not at all clear what you're trying to do, but I don't think what you're trying to do is possible using RegEx at all. The reason being is that a RegEx is a sequence of characters/symbols/whatever that you can match up against something, and your string is just made up of characters that may not be included in the pattern you want.\n\nComment: Can you provide an example input/output for this pattern?\n\nComment: @Samuel: The language supports lookaheads (in most flavors). See http://www.text2.eu/language-support.php#L1H7. Not sure how to use in Python.\n\nComment: What is it a regex for? `Hardare`? `Hardored`? `Hardorede`??\n\nComment: It's unclear what you're trying to do. You're using `textual` module in Python but your code is in Scala. The function `extract` is the way Scala works, e.g. `extract(a, \"(?im)\\\\w+\")`, so I assume you want to extract the part of the string that matches `H_AR_DO_RE_ES_AR_O_N`. But why, for example, would you expect `HARDARD` to be returned, as that isn't even a valid regex (i.e. `Hardard` is a valid substring, but not a valid regex)? This seems like you're going to have to modify your pattern for each possible permutation, and then you're basically going for what Python calls a \"list of options\".\n\nComment: Thanks @RyanWeldon & Samuel Burke. We are doing this exercise on edX Data Science course. We are also encouraged to use the text-extractor module in python as it will provide good insight in the future about regular expressions.\n\nAnswer: You may use the `re.S` flag (surround-word) to enforce the word boundary. You may also use a \\begin{code}\n(?im)^\n\\end{code} anchor and a single lookahead to extract:\n\n\\begin{code}\n# re.S: Surround-word search;\n\nimport re\n\npattern = \"(?im)^H_AR_DO_RE_ES_AR_O_N(?s)\"\n\nstring = 'HARDORE, HARDORED, HARDORED HARDARDE\"'\n\nmatches = re.search(pattern, string)\n\nprint(matches)\n\\end{code}\n\nHere's the output:\n\n\\begin{code}\n>>> string = r'HARDORE, HARDORED, HARDORED HARDARDE\"'\n>>> pattern = r\"(?im)^H_AR_DO_RE_ES_AR_O_N(?s)\"\n>>> matches = re.search(pattern, string)\n>>> matches\n<re.Match object; pos=9, wraps='', length=86, str='...', regex='H_AR_DO_RE_ES_AR_O_N'>\n\\end{code}\n\n\\strong{Notes:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A lookaround is \\em{never} useful in Python's syntax. This is due to Python's string being immutable, which means you cannot backtrack once you have started matching a string. (This immutable nature is a general Python concept you should familiarise yourself with, so you know where to optimise your coding and where not to.) In this regard, Python's strings are a lot like [Lua](http://lua.org/p/manual.html#6.6), and a lookaround could provide huge overhead to match.\n\nIt is more common to do lookarounds in Python using a regular expression library module such as `regex`, `re`, `shlex`, etc.\n\\item With lookaheads, note that:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Regular"

You might want to consider building a custom indexer that takes care of tracking meetings and the information about them. The way you can then build a good search on top of the indexer is by normalizing the information (for example, breaking a location into some core geographic elements and a set of tags such as \"coffee\", \"cafe\", etc.), so you can match on those elements. A combination of fuzzy string search and numeric range query match should help you compare meetings, and you can use a boost function to let meetings with similar info take precedence (to weight on time/location, say). You could also use this function to calculate distance between two meetings."

A: You bet your life! A: You'd better believe it. A: You'd better believe it, yes, AIDS is a killer disease. Yes, yes it is. Yes, it really is a killer disease.\n\nAs you can see, this type involves only a few words. These types are mostly found in emails from spammers.\n\nThere are several methods to analyze text data in a more human-friendly way. Usually, we use some algorithms in a pipeline, to extract and analyze the information. For instance, in a document written in English, the algorithms can help us find words and combinations of words that occur more frequently than in a normal text. In other words, if we take a word like \"having\", we can use it as a context for finding other related words or combinations of words. Another use case can be finding key information in a text. Usually, we use a method called \"N-gram\" to find a sequence of words (or even letters) that appear most frequently in our text.\n\nThe most widespread method for spam detection is called \"Bayesian Classifier\". It is a statistical method that analyses the text of an email, and, based on the characteristics of the text, determines whether the email is spam or not. This method is usually more efficient than the others, because it doesn't consider grammar mistakes, spelling errors or any other human mistakes.\n\n\\em{Bayesian Classifier} works using a probability theory, called \\strong{\"Bayes' Rule\"}, which states that we can compute the probability of an event A, given that event B has already happened.\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nWe can apply Bayesian Classifier to find spam emails by analyzing and classifying the text, and using the algorithm to compute the probability of the given text being spam:\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nAfter this, the probability of the text being spam can be compared to some pre-specified threshold, and if it's above that, the text is classified as spam. For instance, if the threshold is 0.98, and the probability on the text is 0.85, then we know that the probability of the text being spam is higher than 0.85 * 0.98 = 0.825, which means that the text has a higher probability of being spam. So, if we only have time to analyze one email per second, then we need to choose very carefully which email we will analyze, because the emails with lower probability will usually be ignored since they're more likely to be spam.\n\n\\em{Bayesian Classifier} has other uses, like finding spelling mistakes in a text or correcting text that has been written by automated software. For instance, text written by automated software often uses words or sequences of words that can be improved or changed for more natural language.\n\n\\em{Bayesian Classifier} isn't 100% accurate (no algorithm is), but it's still one of the best methods for spam filtering. It is very important to learn this algorithm, because it can be one of the most valuable tools in your software developer's toolkit.\n\n\\strong{How to implement Bayesian Classifier?}\n\nThe algorithms are available and ready to use in Python. The main library I recommend is [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.NBClassifier.html), which is very easy to use. You just need to generate the data, split the data into training and testing data sets, train the classifier on the training data set, and test the classifier on the test one.

Check it out ‚Üì: https://www.npmjs.com/package/language-ai-next\n\nThere are several benefits for integrating language artificial intelligence into your applications, including improved performance, better user experience, the ability to analyze text, and more!\n\nIn this tutorial, we‚Äôll introduce you to using language AI into your Next.js application with a sentiment analysis library like Language-AI-Next. With this library, we can provide improved search and recommendation systems and even automatically classify user reviews as positive or negative! Check it out ‚Üì:\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/language-ai-next\n\nLanguage-AI-Next enables your application to analyze and classify your user-entered text in real time. It provides: -\n\n1) - Analysis of multiple document features - AI uses multiple features of a text document to analyze text inputs. This includes the document‚Äôs lexicon, the document semantic features, and a document‚Äôs author‚Äôs emotion feature.\n\n2) - Efficient parallel inference processing - Next.js‚Äôs API enables efficient inference with parallel processing, so your application doesn‚Äôt experience a delay while processing textual data.\n\n3) - Easy integration with the client-side application: - Next.js allows you to embed JavaScript code in the user‚Äôs document or application. With the help of the API, you can automatically classify a user‚Äôs input as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù or ‚Äúnegative‚Äù and apply it in your application.\n\nLet‚Äôs now have a look at some examples:\n\nIn this example, we are looking at using sentiment analysis to analyze customer reviews! Whenever a customer completes a purchase using your app, you can immediately collect their feedback with our sentiment analysis API, which will automatically classify the feedback as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù or ‚Äúnegative.‚Äù Using this feature, you can easily identify feedback that is negative towards your app. You can then take action, e.g., addressing their concerns, refunding their payments, etc.!\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at the code:\n\nIn the code, Language-AI-Next is configured using an application instance. The instance is used to instantiate a sentiment analysis library. Once instantiated, the library is used to perform sentiment analysis on the language (i.e., the text that is entered). The sentiment analysis results are then used on the customer‚Äôs feedback to determine the customer‚Äôs opinion towards the app.\n\nNote: In this specific example, we used the ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù sentiment label and classified customer feedback as ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù if they expressed dissatisfaction with your app in their review. We used the ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù sentiment label, and classified customer feedback as ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù if they expressed that they were satisfied with your app. You can use any available sentiment labels and labels of your choice while using sentiment analysis!\n\nCheck out the code: https://github.com/ai-language-ai-next/language-ai-next-nextjs/blob/master/examples/_example0001.js\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at another example:\n\nIn this example, we are looking at the usage of language AI within Next.js to analyze user requests!\n\nWe‚Äôre gonna show you how to use Language-AI-Next to help address user requests for your app! In real time, user requests for app features are automatically parsed and classified as either ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù or ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù with Language AI-Next‚Äôs API. After analysing requests, you can take action based on user feedback!\n\nFor example, if a user makes a request to add a feature or fix a problem in the application, you can get immediate feedback about their perceptions using sentiment analysis. You can then act accordingly based on the feedback you garner by using the sentiment analysis results!\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at the code:\n\nIn this code snippet, we are reading a user request directly from the client-side application. The API then parses and classifies user requests, and we get feedback about what user sent. Next, we take action by addressing issues and/or adding new"

Your function is doing exactly what you're asking it to do (return the average salary for each level). However, you're always calling it with the same arguments and so it never seems to change. You'll need to use your variable `$$` as the argument for your function. Your code will look something like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar baseAverage = {}; // define baseAverage as an object\nbaseAverage.dataSource = [{//create an array\n    incomeLevel: \"Fair Jobs\"\n},{//add another array item\n    incomeLevel:\"Poor Jobs\"\n},{//add the last item\n    incomeLevel:\"Rough Jobs\"\n}]\nbaseAverage.series={ //create a JSON object\n    0:{value:\"Fair Jobs\"},\n    //add your series\n\n}\nvar baseAverageValue = baseAverage.series[0].value; //get the value\nconsole.log(baseAverageValue);//this logs the values\nvar isFairJobs = false;\nvar isRoughJobs = false;\nvar isPoorJobs = false;\n\nvar avgsRaw = { //create an object\n    roughJobs: 0,\n    poorJobs: 0,\n    fairJobs: 0\n}\n\nfunction addBaseA"

What you want to do seems to be basically to calculate the best time that meets your requirements:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The two persons (person1 and person2) meet at 1 pm.\n\\item The two persons meet at 12.30 pm.\n\\item The two persons don't meet before 10 am and after 10.30 am.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThat means you want to calculate a function `f(p1,p2,12.30pm,p1,p2,10am), where the time `12.30pm` comes before the `10am` time, and the meeting `1 pm` is taken as `f(p1,p2,12.30pm,p1,p2,10am)=true` and as `f(p1,p2,12.30pm,p1,p2,10am)=false`. The function `f(p1,p2,12.30pm,p1,p2,10am)` is called the \"constraints\" in the constraints programming terminology (the \"meetings\" are called \"variables\" and the \"time interval\" is called a \"quantifier\"). Your question can be viewed as the following one: how to write such a function `f`.\n\nA very convenient way of solving such problems is writing down the constraints in a form of a tree with two layers:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Left layer, with time intervals (starting from the top and going down):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item before 10 am\n\\item from 10 am to 10.30 am\n\\item from 10.30 am to 12 pm\n\\item from 12 pm to 12.30 pm\n\\item from 12.30 pm to 1 pm\n\\end{itemize}\n\\item Right layer, with persons (from left to right):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item person 1 (from top to bottom)\n\\item person 2 (from top to bottom)\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIt means that starting from the top, we can either choose (at the same height of the layer) two persons or a time interval. For example, the interval `from 10 am to 10."

It defines the syntactic structure of a sentence. For English this includes such things as subject-verb-object (for instance: \\textit{The dog \\underline{runs} to the park}), modifiers (for example: \\textit{bigger}), and head-modifier-relations (for instance \\textit{biggest}).\n\nTo measure how well a parser has learned a set of constituencies, we use the \\textbf{SUSY benchmark dataset} \\cite{neural_parse_2016}. This dataset consists of 161,481 sentences paired with 4,005 manually constructed templates. A template is a sentence that contains all of the constituencies of interest. For example, the template: \\textit{noun [verb: gerund/past tense or participle] object noun}, corresponds to sentences like \\textit{John \\underline{wrote} the email} and \\textit{Tim \\underline{drank} a soda} respectively. SUSY contains multiple templates for some of its sentences, and thus can serve as a large scale data source.\n\nAs the size of the English lexicon is limited, a parser must make decisions based on local context. This poses a number of challenges: the parser needs to disambiguate among many alternatives; it needs to determine when to leave a phrase as a single word rather than parse it; it needs to choose the proper relation among constituents (for instance, determining if the verb in \\textit{the dog bit} should modify the dog rather than the phrase \\textit{the dog}).\n\nIn contrast to grammar, semantics is largely left out of English parsing, as it is difficult to define. Instead, lexical properties of words are used to predict constituencies. One of the benefits of SUSY is that spans between words are well defined. For this reason, a parser cannot get incorrect prediction due to word selection: it must be one of only a few possible choices.\n\nWe now describe two widely used models for English parsing:\n\n\\subsection{RNNs} Most current implementations of the sequence-to-sequence paradigm are built based on \\textit{Recurrent Neural Networks} (RNN) \\cite{RNN2015Goodfellow}. An RNN is a sequence of processing elements that is capable of taking a sequence of inputs and outputting an output. In the case of language, the input to the model is the words in the sentence and the output is the constituency structure, as represented by the phrases it contains. The processing elements are \\textit{hidden units} that represent the relationships present in the sentence.\n\nThe basic operation of an RNN is to take in a sequence of words (or spans) and return a sequence of hidden units that represent the internal state of the model. In the case of a language model, this is achieved by iteratively performing an operation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Input ($x$) \\\\\n$h_{t} = \\textit{hidden units at timestep t};$\n\\item Compute hidden units ($h_{t+1}$) \\\\\n$h_{t+1} = \\textit{hidden units at timestep t + 1};$\n\\item Output ($o$) \\\\\n$o = f(h_{t"

The most important component of a speech recognition system is a \\textbf{model}, which maps an acoustic input into a sequence of phonemes (the sounds of sounds). Speech recognition systems consist of several components, including an \\textbf{audio capturing device}, such as a laptop microphone, a \\textbf{pre-processing} component that filters out noise, a \\textbf{hybrid system}, that uses statistical models to decide which phonemes are most likely (this part works rather quickly and is easy to improve), and \\textbf{decoding} system, which maps phonemes into words based on their probabilities. In speech recognition systems based on neural networks (so-called \\textbf{deep neural nets}), these tasks are performed by an artificial neural network.\n\nDeep Speech achieves excellent results on the 2000-hour Switchboard corpus using deep convolutional networks and a variety of preprocessing techniques, outperforming systems based on both feature phonetics and standard factor analysis. In addition to exceeding the performance of the prior state of the art by 29%, our system consistently outperforms other recently proposed neural network speech models.

Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks.

The results from KDD99 datasets are reported for two reasons. First, the KDD99 dataset is commonly used for evaluation of text-based information extraction and categorization models. Second, it provides a more diverse set of magazines to train on than KDD13, which contains magazines from predominantly English-speaking countries. Therefore, KDD99 provides a more realistic dataset to test on for models trained on English.\n\n\\subsection{Models for Text Classification} \\label{sec:models_for_tca}\n\n{We train an ensemble model with ResNet-18~\\cite{he2016deep} and SVM models with 100 dimensions for the classifier.}\n{The baseline ResNet model was pre-trained on ImageNet~\\cite{imagenet} data, while the SVM model was trained using the SVC\\_LIB~\\cite{svcllib} package from the R-project for statistical computing~\\cite{r-package}. This choice was motivated by the fact that the ResNet model performs better than the SVM model on the KDD13 dataset~\\cite{kdd13}, and that the SVM model has also been used in an ablation study in \\cite{gutierrez2020crossmag}, where they obtained comparable classification performance to the baseline ResNet model while using less than one-fiftieth of the labelled dataset required by the ResNet-based models. A more in-depth discussion on how ensemble models and ResNet and SVM models work and what they offer is available in the technical report \\cite{model_report}.}\n\n\\subsection{Models for Text Detection} \\label{sec:models_for_td}\n\n{We use Faster R-CNN to detect both region and paragraph boundaries, and two CNN-based classifiers: the InceptionResNet-V2~\\cite{szegedy2016inception} and DenseNet121~\\cite{huang2017densely} for the text detection model.} For each of the classifier models, we apply several data transformations to the feature maps to obtain more discriminative features. Specifically, we apply a maxpooling operation with a 2$\\times$2 kernel and stride of 2 to the first and second convolutional layers, and then we apply global average pooling to obtain features of size [1,1,784]$^2$. To reduce the dimensionality of the resulting feature maps, we then use two standard dimensionality reduction tools in the field of computer vision: PCA~\\cite{pearson1901lineal} and t-SNE~\\cite{van2008visualizing}. We experiment with PCA with a Kernel of size [784,16] and t-SNE with a perplexity of 30. The choice of an intermediate hyperparameter on the perplexity for t-SNE was motivated by the fact that setting a very high perplexity value can result in misplaced clusters, i.e., classes which are incorrectly placed with each other. On the other hand, the lower the perplexity value is chosen, the more localized the clusters are, which can lead to overly-reduced cluster sizes. Thus, the optimal perplexity value to choose depends on the nature of the dataset, with data with less variation (e.g., datasets from domains such as medicine) requiring a lower perplexity value, while datasets with higher variation (such as datasets from the domains of news or social media) require a higher perplexity value. This reasoning applies both to our experimentation with the KDD13 dataset from the NLP domain and the KDD99 dataset from the OCR domain.\nTo train these models with maximum accuracy, we also used a learning rate scheduler based on Adam~\\cite{adam} with a 3"

There are two kinds of capital:\n\n‚Ä¢ Uppercase - The letter is always capital throughout the whole word.\nExample: WE WANT A UNITED EUROPE.\n\n‚Ä¢ Initial capped - The letters at the beginning of the word are always capital. But the letter at the end of the word may or may not be capitalized. It depends on the word and on where it looks best. This is good for creating titles and headings.\nExample: A uniting force is required to bring together the nations of Europe.\n\nWhat are small caps?\n\nSmall caps is a way to display words and names that are too large to fit on the page but should still be made special. They are the most used method for typesetting text that appears on the web. The small cap style looks something like this:\n\n\\em{C A P I T A L L E E S}\n\nWhere the 's' on the end is small caps.\nUsing small caps:\nSmall caps are most often used for headlines and subheads. Using small caps will make the text on the page more noticeable and attractive. You might also choose to use small caps for a specific item ‚Äî for example, your company name, or title or name of an article.\n\n\\strong{Here you have a rule for capital letter.}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Upper case ‚Äì The letters are\n  always capital throughout the\n  whole word.\nExample: WE WANT A UNITED EUROPE\n  \\item Initial\n  capped ‚Äì The letters at the beginning\n  of the word are always capital\n  and the letter at the end of the\n  word may be or may not be capitalized,\n  it depends on the word and on where\n  it looks best.This is good to create\n  Titles and headings.\nExample: A uniting force\n  is required to bring together the\n  nations of Europe.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: What do you mean by sentence?"

The parent spoke about the need for parents to be involved in their children's education. There was also a discussion about the importance of funding for schools.\n\nThe speakers also talked about the importance of keeping up with technology. The teacher gave an example of a school that had a digital media center, where students could do research using computers and the Internet. The parent suggested having an online school that students could attend. It was also suggested that each student be assigned an online teacher who could assess their work and monitor their progress.\n\nThe purpose of the conference was to discuss how to improve the quality of education in schools. The main speakers were Professor Crew Purdie and Teacher Oliver Malachi. They spoke about setting high standards for students and teachers. The other important thing was to have a discussion about the importance of both parents and teachers in the development and education of their children.\n\nParagraphs with Subheadings\n\nThe speakers at the conference all had different opinions on the goals of education. However, most of them agreed that setting high standards and having supportive parents were important. One of the speakers, Professor Crew Purdie, said that schools should set high expectations for students. The other speakers agreed that students should be given challenging tasks. However, the professor stressed that schools should also help students learn by providing them with good teachers and supportive parents.\n\nStudents also need to set high standards for themselves, he said. The other speakers agreed that students should feel motivated to do their best. Student Oliver Malachi, who is a teacher, said that high standards also mean having high expectations for teachers. He said that teachers give their best by working hard and following their passion. He suggested that their students follow their example and set their own high standards of teaching and learning.\n\nThe other speakers also encouraged students to take responsibility for their own learning. Kolby Reese stressed the importance of parental involvement, saying that parents should be their children's first teachers. He said parents should spend time with their children and make sure that they are doing their schoolwork and helping out around the house. He suggested that parents should also be involved in their children's future. Both students and parents are key to helping their children succeed, he said.\n\nStudents and teachers can also set high standards for themselves by working hard and following their interests. Malachi had some suggestions for how students can take responsibility. He said that students should spend time working on school assignments and studying. Parents and teachers can help students by providing information and materials, and by supporting them at every step, he said. He also suggested that teachers give their students opportunities to reflect on their progress and improve their skills.\n\nTechnology can also play a major role in student learning. Professor Purdie talked about using technology to improve the learning environment in schools. He said that technology can help teachers provide more effective feedback to their students and improve students' skills and knowledge in a wide range of subjects and topics. Kolby Reese suggested that parents and students use the Internet to help their children manage their schoolwork and find information for school, college, and careers. He encouraged students to use the Internet to expand their learning both inside and outside of school. He also stressed the importance of helping children learn how to use technology properly, so that they can develop their skills, knowledge, and critical thinking abilities in the 21st century.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the importance of keeping up with developments in education. Purdie talked about a digital media center in a school where students are learning new information and skills. He said that schools need to provide students a \"diverse array of educational opportunities and experiences\" to keep up with changing needs and technology. Malachi suggested that students could have an online school they could attend from their homes. Online schools are popular now, and many people think they offer a great option for students who want flexible schedules and ways to learn at their own pace and develop their own study skills and academic skills. Parents who are concerned about their children's safety can enjoy knowing that students are getting an education in a safe, secure environment at an online school, he said.\n\n"

        "output": "You are given a Python command and are required to convert it into Ruby.\n\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n   `\nI'm not sure how to do this, but I have tried. Would really appreciate any feedback or help. Thanks!\n\nComment: `print \"hello\"`. `puts \"hello\"`.\n\nComment: `print \"Hello world!\")` in python ?\n\nComment: `puts -p \"Hello world\"` in ruby\n\nComment: what's wrong with the current code? (and no need for any sort of loop, what's the point of that)\n\nComment: If you search the web you can find many resources about this and it will be also helpful to understand this language better!\n\nAnswer: There are two main ways to write text in Ruby: `puts` or `print`. `puts` writes output to the console; `print` writes output to the file you are currently processing. So if you write something like:\n\n\\begin{code}\nrequire \"open-uri\"\nrequire \"csv\"\ncsv = CSV.parse(OpenURI(\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/learn-ruby-the-hard-way/legacy_chapters/chapter-1.csv\"))\ncsv.map { |row| p row }\n\\end{code}\n\nYour output would be:\n\n\\begin{code}\n[\"John\", \"Doe\", \"john@example.com\", ...\n[\"Mary\", \"Smith\", \"mary@example.com\", ...\n\n... etc.\n\\end{code}\n\nSo if you want to convert your code like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n\\end{code}\n\nThen in Ruby you would do something like:\n\n\\begin{code}\nputs(\"Hello World!\")\n\\end{code}\n\nOr if you want to convert your code like this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nputs \"Hello World\"\n\\end{code}\n\nThen in Ruby you would do something like:\n\n\\begin{code}\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: What you are getting is a raw Python \\strong{command}, from your input string.\n\nIf you are getting a string that says \\em{\"print 'Hello World'\\n\"} then this is your Python code:\n\n\\begin{code}\nprint \"Hello World\"\n\\end{code}\n\n`print` is a \\strong{function} in Python, same as in Ruby, and it works much the same way. In Python, your original string would output the following:\n\n\\begin{code}\nHello World\n\\end{code}\n\nin plain text. The string above was a raw string, meaning it can span multiple lines, but Python still outputs it in a single line.\n\nIn Ruby, however, it does not work like that. Ruby considers your string to be a \\strong{command}, or a \\strong{statement}, and instead of running the Python code, it will simply print `Hello World` to the console.\n\nSo in Ruby, that string would output:\n\n\\begin{code}\nHello World\n\\end{code}\n\nYou have two choices: run the Python code your self, or rewrite it in Ruby.\n\nIf you want to run the Python code, you can use a \\strong{Virtual Machine} (VM) like \\strong{[PhantomJS](https://www.phantomjs.org/phantomjs.html)}:\n\n\\begin{code}\nirb(main):001:0> require 'phantomjs'; puts \"Hello World!\"\n\\end{code}\n\nwhich will then translate:\n\n\\begin{code}\nHi Ruby,\nI am running this command on the VM\n  require 'phantomjs'\nso please use PhantomJS to run the code\nthen use the result to run this code:\n  puts \"Hello World!\"\nPhantomJS is loading...\ndone\nHello World!\n\\end{code}\n\nTo run the PHP command from Ruby.\n\nIf you don't want to run this code using an external VM, but rather do this with Ruby, you can do it one of two ways: use the `Print` class, or use the `#puts` method:\n\n\\begin{code}\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n# or with #puts\nputs(\"Hello World!\")\n\\end{code}\n\nIn both cases, you need to \\strong{escape} the quotes:\n\n\\begin{code}\nprint(\"Hello World!"

You might need to specify that the soldier and the general are natural numbers with the appropriate domains, but if you do that I think you'll be able to translate your sentence into a plausible English sentence.\n\nAnswer: You have given a first order logic sentence in English. Let's remove first order logic and understand what you want:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nExist general who is also a soldier\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nYou need an existential quantifier, so it would be in the form\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n(‚àÉg)(general(g) AND soldier(g));\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNow the English translation is easy, but let's do it with symbols:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nFor some g: g is a general and g is a soldier;\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nor alternatively\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\textbf{‚àÉg} g is a general and g is a soldier;\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe former is the way I prefer to express this."

In order to get better results you need to understand, how the text is related to each other, which words have higher importance? Your approach should be: you have only one document, but a lot of users. Their queries are different. You need to have one query for each user. How you achieve that? By looking for a specific match.\n\nComment: But I already have a specific match in my query. The user query is sky is blue. To classify it as relevant, I need to get one document that shows a blue sky. To classify it as irrelevant, I need to get one document that does not show a blue sky. Where is the logic in this? How do I determine if sky is blue is a relevant query or not?\n\nComment: Please see the updated answer. You may find this useful: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lift-evaluation-machine-learning/.\n\nComment: It doesn't really answer my question, but it's more than enough for me to understand the problem. :) I'll read through all the links and see how I can apply it in my case. Thank you for your help.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item Match the query with document to see whether it is \\strong{relevant} or \\strong{non relevant} (in case of your example 'why sky is blue' and 'document', \\strong{why sky is blue} - relevant and 'document' - non relevant)\n\\item Compute the feature vector based on the key words extracted from the query and document\n\\item Evaluate feature based on prediction accuracy, error in prediction etc.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: To classify sky as blue as relevant, I have to get a document that shows a blue sky, right? I'm struggling to think of the actual logic that would determine whether the sky was blue or not.\n\nComment: @user106450 Yes, to classify 'sky as blue' relevant you need a sample document which shows 'sky as blue'. How to get that document? That you have to figure out. E.g. you have to crawl and fetch the document.\n\nComment: I'm aware of crawling but this query will literally have to search for the sky is blue as that's something only a human would know about :/ It's very weird.\n\nComment: @user106450 Actually, the sky is blue or not, can't be determined by humans?\n\nComment: Oh ya, I get what you mean, it would be a difficult problem to solve. The point is, I'll have to search for information on that and there is no such way to predict whether the information is relevant or not. As a result, I would just put the information into my database, without classifying it as relevant or not, and later users would be able to search for relevant information from it."

However, they are concerned about the project deadline and need to understand which tasks can get delayed without causing a delay in the release date.\n\nRose is still not sure how long the project will take to complete and needs to get a better sense of how much time her team spends on the various tasks. She is also concerned about whether she will have enough resources to finish all the tasks at once and would appreciate tips on how best to handle this issue.\n\nFran's team has a lot of experience working together and feels confident that they will be able to make this project successful. However, the team is concerned about how many hours per day they are asked to work in order to finish the project on schedule.\n\nJim is having trouble deciding what direction to take for the website project and is concerned that the final result won't be suitable for all of their customers. To get some advice, he asks what his teammates think about the proposal.\n\n##### D S KILLS\n\n**Knowledge** : 1. Teamwork 2. Project management 3. Interpersonal \n**Critical thinking** : 1.

Summarize and distill complex information and ideas into clear, concise and accurate descriptions 2. Identify the main ideas and supporting details in written text 3. Determine theme of a given passage of text\n\n##### E XAMPLES OF QUESTIONS\n\n1. What has the team's progress been on the project so far?\n\"Jane's team has been working hard to design the new feature and has met all their deadlines thus far. They are going over every detail to make sure that the feature is exactly what is needed and that it performs perfectly. Since this is the team members' first project together, they are also working to resolve any misunderstandings that may arise as they work together toward the common goal of a successful release.\"\n\n2. Which member is working on which part of the project?\n\"John is the lead on the feature design and is leading his team in designing the new feature using a process he used previously in another company. He has hired three experienced developers to work on the feature once it has been designed and Jane is working with the software development team to ensure that the code complies with the company's standards for security and reliability.\"\n\n3. What is the most challenging part of the project?\n\"Tom has found writing the software code to be the most challenging aspect of this project so far. His team has a large backlog of customer features that need to be implemented and the deadline for this project is approaching, so he really needs his team to work well together and be able to move quickly.\"\n\n4. Is any teammate concerned about any part of the project?\n\"Fran is feeling overwhelmed by all that her team needs to do to ensure that this project is successful. She is very conscientious and has been working hard to make sure that everything is done right. Although she is highly skilled and competent, she is working at a much higher level than she is used to and is unsure if she will be able to get everything done.\"\n\n5. How can other teammates help with this project?\n\"Rose has expertise in feature design and understands what is needed to make a successful product. She can help Jane's team determine the best way to design the new feature to ensure that it matches customer requirements and is intuitive and easy for customers to use. Jane can learn a lot from her experience with feature designs.\"\n\n6. What changes to the project might be made to make it more successful?\n\"Alice was impressed by the team's presentation, but knows that there is always room for improvement. She wants to make sure that her team members know that she values their insight and feedback and encourages them to share their ideas on how she can help make the team even more successful by"

Let $c$ be the centroid with smallest Euclidean distance to $O$ and set $O_i = c$ for observation $i$. Aggregation function:\n\\begin{equation}\nA(y_1,...,y_n) = f(O_1,...,O_n)\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $f(y_1,...,y_n)=\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i$ and $w_i = \\frac{d(O_i, c)}{\\sum_{j=1}^n d(O_j, c)}$ and $d(x, x) = ||x_1 - x_2 ||_2$.

        "output": "Suggest some product bundles that are often purchased with a given product.\n\nMacBook Air with 128G SSD, Logitech Ultrathin keyboard. This is for people who really need ultraportability at a very high level.\n\nMacBook Air with 256GB SSD, Logitech Ultrathin keyboard. This is for people who really need ultraportability and don't need the 128G. Increases revenue vs. MacBook Air with 128G, as well as having a smaller profit loss than the other bundle, at around $100.\n\nMacBook Pro with 256G SSD, 2.4GHz, Logitech Ultrathin. Similar to the previous bundle, more ultraportable than the previous one and more features than the lowest-model MacBook Air\n\nAll of these bundles should have a higher retail price than the single products. All of them could also have a few of these bundled together (e.g. the top-of-the-line and bottom-of-the-line), as they'd not only make more money per unit sold, but would also reduce the amount of discounting Apple needs to perform.\n\nApple could also go a different route, and sell different types of the \"Ultrathin keyb\", so as to give people more choice about the one they buy.\n\nAll of these bundles could also be given an \"Apple Care\" discount to bring them in line with Apple's other retail products.\n\nWhat about the MacBook lineup? Here's one option that would give Apple more than the current profit margin on each model.\n\nMacBook Air, 13.3\" screen, 4 GB Ram, 256G SSD. Retail price is $1399, but Apple would keep more of each sale if they sold it for $1299 without the loss of much profit.\n\nMacBook, 13.3\" screen, 4 GB Ram, 128G SSD. Retail price is $1199, but they could sell it for $1099 to Apple Care customers, and keep more profit margin than they currently do.\n\nMacBook Pro, 13.3\" screen, 4 GB Ram, 256G SSD. Retail price, as with the previous version, is $1299, but they could sell it for $1199 to Apple Care customers, and keep more profit margin than they currently do.\n\nWhy make Apple Care an option instead of making it outright required? Simply due to customer choice. Yes, Apple Care is highly recommended, and if Apple decided to take away the option and make it required, I'm sure Apple's profit margins would rise. However, Apple's profit margins would sink if customers weren't given the choice of whether or not they wanted to pay the extra costs, as some customers will not want to pay the extra costs, even though they might see it as necessary in the long term.\n\nThe current logic behind Apple's approach to margins is: \"Why would we lower our margins? We like making a lot of money, and we hope these moves will make us even more money.\" While that may be true, there are two things to keep in mind here. The first being that Apple's margins are so high that they have little to do with whether or not they give Apple Care as an option or make it required. The margins on Apple Care itself are relatively low (5% or less of the price, in most cases), so they provide Apple with very little extra money when you include the other hardware costs involved in making and shipping the product to the customer. The second thing is this: by making Apple Care a required purchase, Apple can drive up the volume of Apple Care policies sold, and thus drive up the number of software updates and customer support available for Apple products, as well as the number of people who are willing to upgrade when new Apple hardware comes out.\n\nThe current margins on Apple products are high, and a little bit more on Apple Care isn't a big deal, compared to the benefits Apple gains via the Apple Care plan. If Apple wanted to, they could even create an optional Apple Care plan for all of Apple's products, instead of just for Mac products. In contrast to the current bundles I suggested, this plan would sell hardware at Apple's usual price, and the additional software and support services would be sold separately for a higher profit margin.\n\nAnyway, those are just my thoughts on this and the margins Apple gets.\n\nComment: +"

        "output": "Create a template in markdown to create scope for Jira tickets. Members should use this template as a checklist to ensure they have included all the necessary information when creating a ticket. Members should fill in the following parts of the template when creating a ticket: Template template.jira@snowflake.net. Type template name for the ticket here. Project name for the ticket. Project name is very important because it will give context later on. Create a new ticket and assign it to the member responsible for communicating with the user. Template: Ticket Name: Template: Project Name: Create ticket in Jira and set it to the appropriate status. When the ticket has been created, the member responsible for communicating with the user should send the Jira ticket number to the team. Once this has been done, other members should copy the Jira ticket number into the template in a comment when they create their own ticket.

The team can then use Jira to manage issues, as well as any additional features of the tool. This method is commonly used by teams that have little or no experience with agile development.\nUsing an issue tracking tool will: Provide a place for project members to track their progress and tasks, in addition to being able to store other information such as meeting notes and decisions. Ensure that everyone who is assigned a task is aware of what that task is and when it needs to be completed by, and can ensure that deadlines are properly respected.\nMore information on Jira (specifically Jira, and not Jira Cloud or Jira Core) can be found in the Jira user guide.\nIn addition to using any of the approaches above, project managers should also: Use templates to create documentation (e.g. project scope template, project status template, meeting/decision templates).

So you cannot have a method which returns a list of `HotelFind` instances from a method that takes an instance of `HotelEngineering`.\n\nIf the return type and parameter type are different, then there will be a different number of arguments from either side. So if you have a method which takes a `HotelEngineering` instance, then you must also have a method which takes a list of hotelEngineering instances and returns a list of HotelFinder instances.\n\nYou may have gotten to the end of your journey with the first two.\n\nComment: The first snippet is perfectly fine, you're returning the HotelFind objects from HotelEngineering with a generic type of HotelSearch."

        "output": "Paraphrase the given text in an academic style.\n\nLots of papers have been published on this topic.\n\nHowever, there is still controversy over what exactly constitutes 'academic style' and how the student should achieve it.\n\nMany writers have attempted to define the characteristics of academic style; however, there is no consensus.\n\n(i) Academic style is usually described as an objective style with a formal tone.\n\nThis means that the student should avoid colloquial expressions such as 'as you know', 'you might say that' and 'in my opinion'.\n\nIt is also recommended that informal words such as 'good' and 'great' should be avoided.\n\n(ii) Academic style does not give the impression that the author is writing for an audience.\n\nIt is generally accepted that a formal tone should be apparent at all times: for example, the author's opinions should not be stated explicitly.\n\nIt is not acceptable for the author to include any personal information about themselves.\n\nAdditionally, the student should not adopt a personal style in their writing.\n\nFor example, a student should avoid referring to themselves in the third person or using their name in an unusual way.\n\n(iii) Academic writing does not employ informal expressions that are used in spoken English.\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is that the student should adopt a formal and neutral tone.\n\nAcademic writing should be unambiguous and precise with no indication of the author's attitude or beliefs.\n\n(iv) Academic style is not always simple and straightforward.\n\nIt is not acceptable for the student to adopt a simple, straightforward tone when delivering a well-reasoned argument.\n\nAcademic style refers to the appropriate use of vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure.\n\nFor example, a student should avoid using jargon when writing their essay.\n\nAlso, it is important that the student employs complex sentences rather than using short, simple sentences.\n\n(v) Academic writing employs the following features:\n\n(a) A concise, informative and objective opening paragraph which introduces the ideas to be discussed in the essay without being too assertive.\n\n(b) Detailed, accurate and well-structured analysis of all the relevant areas of the subject being discussed.\n\n(c) A logical and systematic flow of ideas.\n\n(d) Accurate and concise referencing of material that has been used in the essay.\n\n(vi) Academic style does not always involve using long, complex sentences in an attempt to impress the reader with the student's command of English.\n\nOn the contrary, academic style is achieved by using simple sentences and simple ideas.\n\nAcademic writing is precise, detailed and unambiguous.\n\n(vii) Academic style does not always adopt a strict, formal tone.\n\nThe author should ensure that the tone used is consistent throughout the essay.\n\nFor example, it is possible to adopt a playful, informal tone without offending the reader or breaking any of the basic rules of academic writing.\n\nThe author's attitude and beliefs should be apparent while achieving a formal tone.\n\nThe following features can be used to help the student achieve a formal and academic tone:\n\n(i) Avoid informal expressions such as 'as you know', 'you might say that' and 'in my opinion'.\n\n(ii) Adopt a formal, objective tone that is free from personal opinions.\n\n(iii) Adopt an appropriate tone that gives an accurate account of the subject being written about.\n\n(iv) Adopt a structured paragraphing strategy to ensure a logical flow of ideas and avoid digressions.\n\nComment: \"Academic writing is precise, detailed and unambiguous.\". Really?  The best advice I got concerning clarity was from R.H. Barros' \"Academic Writing in English,\" and here's some of the gems: \"The English language, being highly flexible, allows for a great amount of ambiguity...\"; or \"...you will become aware of some basic aspects of academic writing that many professional writers might not be fully aware of.\" And on and on--great stuff for anyone who wants to be a master of English prose.\n\nAnswer: There is no single academic style to write to, but there is a set of guidelines, which you'll do best finding yourself.\n\nIf you want a little help trying find your own voice, I recommend [RH Barros's \"Academic Writing in English\".](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/"

        "output": "Make a list of the pros and cons of the given decision.\n\nImplementing a Remote Working Policy\n\nIn this case, your organization‚Äôs pros might be:\n\n* Increased productivity\n* Lower cost\n* Mobility/flexibility\n\nAnd the cons could include:\n\n* Increased communication demands\n* Lack of face-to-face interaction\n* Possibility of less collaboration among team members\n\nOnce you have done so, you should be able to confidently make a decision on whether or not to implement a remote working policy. This decision should be based on the pros and cons you found as well as a gut feeling.\n\nStep Five: Develop a Plan and Initiate Training\n\nYou have decided on implementing a remote working policy and have made some projections for the long-term benefits of this decision. Now, you will need to create a detailed plan for its successful implementation into your organization.\n\nBe sure to take these steps as you draft this plan:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Outline who should be included in this training.\n\\item Outline your expectations about working remotely.\n\\item Outline what your organization‚Äôs role is in the training. Be clear on what your responsibility is to the remote workers, and let them know their responsibility as employees.\n\\item Outline your expectations about communication, technology, and the overall remote work experience.\n\\item Be prepared to help workers troubleshoot their technology or other issues.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nOnce again, it is important to ensure that you include workers of varying experience levels. Remember that a lot of younger workers today were brought up to work remotely, and their expectations could be much different than the expectations of an older generation or a more traditional workplace."

        "output": "Include important study notes and key points that someone should know about the given subject.\n\nhistory of the USA\n\n1. How did the original colonists and Native Americans help make America what it is today?\n\n2. What factors do you believe are the largest contributors to how the government has operated?\n\n3. Why is free speech one of the most cherished foundations for the American government?\n\n4. Why is the Constitution and Bill of Rights so incredibly important to the future of the American government?\n\n5. How has the American government influenced or shaped modern politics in other parts of the world?\n\n*Note: These are just examples of topics that you can write about and you should know that the purpose of these notes is to give you information about something. The information should be broken into manageable chunks and you should make sure the information is relevant.\n\n## Evaluating your notes\n\nThere are some important steps that a person needs to take when making their note so that it can be useful. It is important to remember how you use these notes when doing your studying. To begin you should make sure your notes are useful in the way that you will understand them when taking a test and that you will be able to use them for what they are intended for. You could do this by making sure to write down whatever is important you will understand when you read them. This way you will be able to use them. You could also include whatever information you are asked to include in your notes and you should make sure you understand what you write. When you understand what you are writing or are taking notes about you will be able to use it to your advantage in studying and testing.\n\n## Criticism\n\nThere have been some criticisms about how effective note taking is while studying but note taking has proven to be an effective study skill that many have benefited from using.\n\nSome critics would argue that note taking is just a way to write down the information and if you don't have a way to study effectively then you won't be able to use your notes effectively which is not the case at all as many different individuals have proven that simply taking notes can be extremely beneficial.\n\n1. If you are someone who has difficulty focusing while studying you should take notes because they will help you organize information better and be able to use it later when it is needed.\n\n2. If you are taking notes but don't understand what they mean then you will not be able to use the notes for what they are intended for which limits the use of notes and takes away the effectiveness of it.\n\n3. If you don't get the chance to go over or study the notes you took then it would defeat the purpose of taking notes which would make taking notes useless.\n\n4. If you don't understand the topic that is being studies then taking notes won't help much and simply writing down information that you don't understand will just prove to be useless and unhelpful."

Good luck.\n\nComment: Thank you, I did it using a List<String> ratingResults = new ArrayList<String>();\n    Collections.sort(ratingResults, new Comparator<String>() {\n            @Override\n            public int compare(String o1, String o2) {\n                return o2.compareTo(o1);\n            }\n        });\n\nComment: Glad it helped; now it can be used to print all ratings and names as desired.\n\nAnswer: Try it like this.

God of War was nominated for several awards and was named game of the year at the 2021 D.I.C.E. Awards, Game Awards, and BAFTA Awards.\n\nJames Mielke of Hardcore Gamer praised the game's story and cinematic sequences, but he also critiqued technical aspects. He also stated that it is the best God of War game yet due to the lack of \"stumbling around in the dark, the lack of a checkpoint after a boss, and the lack of having to do tedious platforming to get back to where you were.\" He ended the review stating, \"With how much I've invested into the series, I'd be down for taking on a new journey in God of War's colorful world and am happy that SIE Santa Monica decided to keep the faith.\"\n\nThe PlayStation Store has sold an estimated 5.2 million units, with 80% of those coming from digital distribution, making it the second best-selling release of 2021 and one of the highest-selling remakes of all-time.\n\n## External links\n\n* Official website"

What is the difference in methods and results sections for research papers in computer science?\n\nAnswer: It depends on the topic.\n\nFor example in an article about a new algorithm (and most of the time there are two articles: one about the \\em{idea}, one about the \\em{implementation}), it is very similar to a scientific paper: introduction, research methodology (what algorithms you have used), results, discussion, conclusion and references. However, a lot of time you will find that someone already implemented the algorithm or the result is just something that follows from the theory or is an obvious consequence. In this case I would say it is a method article.\n\nFor more concrete examples, let's say you have written a paper about an interesting application of your algorithm. This paper would have a very similar structure to a scientific paper, but you would not be able to give a clear research methodology. It would be more like a research article, which describes an interesting application of a new algorithm.\n\nComment: So, it seems that there is no \"common\" structure, it really depends on the topic."

The other is a placebo. Neither pill you‚Äôre\nabout to take will kill you.

The world of men. To be submissive and have the man make those choices. But I see it from a different perspective. Because I believe everything starts the moment we are born. That the decisions we make, the choices we take, set in motion the direction our lives will take. My journey to you started the moment I left that city and decided to make the most simple, and important choice of my life. To love. To be loved. To have a family of my own. Your love is more important to me than any political situation or any ideology or any religion. Because a woman needs love more than anything in the world. And I believe if we choose to love one another, we won‚Äôt have to look far for that love, will we? Because the answer can only be in one place, and that‚Äôs inside all of us. There is a choice you can make. To believe in the future. To believe that we are all one. That the only true power is that of love and compassion. To have faith in men, that we can be good. That we can be responsible. You can give me the red pill or the blue pill. But it doesn‚Äôt matter, because I‚Äôve made my decision. \\strong{I‚Äôve chosen a future without you.}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n_{(\\em{The Matrix} (1999) dir.

Place the forearms on the tabletops, hands with fingers pointing towards each other. Stagger the legs off one foot, bend at the knees and press the hips off the floor. Return to the original position and repeat twice. Alternate the stance as you perform two sets of 10 reps. For an even easier alternative, have the legs staggered and the feet pointing towards the table. Now bring your hands behind you to make a t shape with your body. Hold the arms together as you raise the hips. Squeeze the gluts as you squat forward and return to the start position. Perform two sets of 10 reps and then repeat with the alternate leg forward. For a challenging and full-body exercise have a small weight, a barbell or a dumbbell in each hand. Stagger across the floor starting with the right foot and bring the left knee up and over the right leg. The right knee should be resting on a table or chair. The left knee should be bent at the angle of 90 degrees as you raise the torso and bring the shoulders towards the feet. Lower slowly over two counts and then place the heel of the left leg on a chair behind and rest for one count. Stand to repeat with the other side. Perform two sets of 10 reps and then repeat alternating side. For a complete exercise for triceps, have a light weight or a dumbbell in each hand and raise it up to your chin. Now squeeze the tricep muscles as you bring your elbows close to the body and extend the arms, squeezing the triceps as you lift your shoulders off the table. Rest for one count and then place your arms back to the original position. Perform two sets of 10 reps with slow and controlled motion. After that repeat raising up the forearms and the shoulders, bringing the triceps into full contract. In the last, return back to place the arms over the head, squeeze the triceps as you raise your shoulders off the table. Rest for one count and then repeat two sets of 10 reps.\nYou can perform a push-up but that will tax your chest muscles more than your triceps. Use dumbbells or a small weight if there is no push-up bar available.\nPerform two sets of 10 reps.\nLie on your side and place the forearm on the floor in between your legs, bringing the elbow at the level of the hip.\nNow lift the top of the bent knee and place it a few inches off the ground.\nKeep a straight position of the hip for more balance as you raise the top leg up.\nSqueeze the buttocks to lift the hips up while the back remains neutral, avoid rolling forward and backward.\nKeep the leg on the floor, resting on the forearm, for a few seconds, lower and repeat on the alternate side for two sets of 10 reps.\nLie on your side, resting your elbow on the table, extending the bottom leg.\nPlace the top foot on the floor and lift the leg up, toes pointing away from the body.\nNow squeeze the buttocks and lower the leg back along the body, keeping the heel on the ground throughout the exercise.\nBring the leg back up and repeat for two sets of 10 reps, alternating the leg.\nPerform the exercises for 30 minutes for effective strength building and fat burning exercise at your office. Start the session with a five to seven minute warm-up, go slow and make sure you are not over exerting yourself. Take a break of at least two minutes before you start the workout and remember to stretch. A little water or sports drink should keep you hydrated while you sweat at your office. Perform core exercises like push-ups, crunches, tricep extensions, hip circles and squats twice a week to maintain toned abs and thighs. In the last, take a two-minute break and repeat the circuit one more time for a full 45-minute workout.\nYour fitness and health goals will be achieved if you exercise at the office three times a week.

So i think its definitely hit its plateau! Also, if i went again i would check into an off property restaurant!\n\nAnswer: I also thought of a probabilistic approach that is close to the \\strong{classic} POS-tagging \\strong{HMM} but can be applied to other text data. Suppose you have the POS tags of your text data with a tag as a \"header\" if it matches a pre-defined pattern, otherwise is just an attribute for the words it is attached to, for example the case \"\\em{dog} \\strong{went} \\strong{to} \\em{pub}\" with \"\\em{dog} goes\\strong{to} pub.\n\nHaving this POS tagging structure, your HMM takes one hidden variable per tag as observed in the data (in your case the first word). From each tag (in your case the first word) you extract attributes (in your case the following words). If the tag is the header one you assume a distribution for all attributes. If not, you assume a distribution for all tags. The transition function will depend on the tag and the position inside the text for tagged words. It would be something like:\n\n\\begin{code}\np(w_i | w_i-1, w_j ; w_i_pos) = p(w_i | w_i-1)'[w_j, w_i_pos]\n\\end{code}\n\nwhere `p` can be the probability, the log-likelihood or some other function depending on the task. If you want you can introduce a dynamic tag model in the transition function to account for the uncertainty of the tag (this has been done in text clustering, also related to probabilistic modeling).\n\nIf you have a language model (for example the one produced in the [LM4J](https://github.com/shardulbhavsar/lm4j) library) you can use it to estimate the probabilities of the words in the text and use this data in the HMM in order to compute the log-likelihood of the tags, for example:\n\n\\begin{code}\np(w_i_pos | w_i - 1, w_i | w_j; w_l) = p(w_i) * p(w_i_pos | w_i - 1) * p(w_i | w_i - 1, w_j; w_l)\n\\end{code}\n\nand replace the function `p(w_i)` with the word score computed by the language model. I have used this approach in a probabilistic sentiment analysis (using the text provided in a [sport forum](http://forum.worldcupfans.com/)) comparing to a classic HMM of word-to-word transitions. This approach has the advantage that you do not need to train an EM algorithm for an HMM and still achieve good results.\n\n\\strong{UPDATE}:\n\nYou can extract the attributes for the text data with a simple LM that uses the HMM parameters and a dynamic tag model that assigns a probability to the tags, for example something like\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef tag_prob(tag):\n    return p(tag | w_1)\n\ndef tag_attributes(tag):\n    return p(w_2, w_3, ...)\n\ntag, attributes = tag_prob(tag) < tag_attributes(tag)\n\\end{code}\n\nwhere `w_1` the first tag, `w_2, w_3` is the next tag and so on. Note that a probabilistic approach is not necessarily linear in time but the complexity can be reduced using hashing functions to acceler"

On the other hand, the salad section they had was impressive. There was a variety of lettuce. There were tomatoes, cucumbers. What surprised me about it was the fact that they had a special salad dressing bar if you wanted to put your own dressing on your salad. The main reason why I was most impressed and why I loved this particular bakery/sandwich shop was because they allowed you to customize your sandwich. They had a variety of bread and toppings such as ham, salami, bologna, roasted turkey, and roasted chicken breast. But the thing that made it all come together and the thing that made me really want this bakery was the fact that they put a mixture of vegetables into their sandwiches like tomatoes, avocados, jalapenos and cucumbers. This allowed me to have a healthier sandwich rather than having something like ham or turkey or chicken. In addition to that, this was a great place to meet up with someone you know. There were multiple areas that you could sit and have conversations.

The house opened to the public on October 25, 1986 as part of the International Symposium on Smart Structures Program.\n\nLater, a smart home was built in California as part of a research program at the University of California. Several other smart home projects were built across the United States, such as the project on Georgia Tech campus and the project developed as a part of the Smart Living Demonstration Project by Intel. In 2009, a smart home was built in Cambridge, Canada by Research and Development (Canada) as part of a partnership with Ontario (Canada) Government.\n\n### Future homes concept\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) describes the future home concepts that can enable advanced energy management and energy efficiency features that could allow \"zero net energy‚Äù buildings and \"zero carbon\" homes. The NIST project focused on designing technology solutions that can enable the smart homes concept. For example, an integrated approach is used that combines the principles of building planning, design, building information modeling (BIM) with renewable energy system design, automation technology planning and implementation.\n\n## Benefits\n\nSome benefits that smart homes are designed to accomplish include:\n\n* Reduced home energy usage, which is achieved by automation that will only use energy based on the occupant's needs and desires\n* Increased comfort, safety, security and convenience via automation systems and home appliances\n* Improved home management, maintenance and operations via home automation and home appliances\n* Improved sustainability through energy-efficient design and improved energy efficiency\n* Cost savings: energy efficient systems, lower utility bills and reduced home maintenance costs\n* Improved health and safety.\n\n## Challenges\n\nDespite the clear benefits of smart homes, several challenges have to be overcome before the concept becomes accepted and successful. Many consumers do not want to be \"tied down\" to an automation infrastructure. Therefore, smart home systems will have to be flexible enough to easily integrate into the existing infrastructures. Home appliances such as smart thermostats and smart light bulbs (such as Philips Hue, LED Lights, etc.), smart locks, and smart home energy management systems have started to enter mainstream markets but have shown mixed adoption rates.\n\n## Examples of technology\n\nBelow are some of the technology products that are used in smart homes worldwide:\n\n* Smart thermostats, such as Nest, Ecobee, and Hive\n* Smart appliances: smart doorbells, smart security cameras, and smart security sensors\n* Smart locks: smart deadbolts, smart garage door openers, and smart doorbells\n* Smart home energy management: Smart plug, Smart energy monitoring, smart plugs, smart light switches, and smart power strips\n* In-Home entertainment: smart speakers, smart TVs, smart remotes, and smart media players\n* Smart outlets: smart charging outlets and smart USB ports, smart power strips\n* Other products: smart watches, smart toaster, smart mirror, and more\n\n## Advantages\n\nThe advantages of smart homes include:\n\n### Technology and infrastructure\n\n* Consumers"

My older sister had to go to boarding school far away and she had very little time to go through all her schoolwork, so I agreed to help her to finish all her work because I was responsible for her school work and it was important that I kept it. She was very happy and felt that she could concentrate and finish all her schoolwork because I had made a promise to give her much needed help from time to time. One day when it was time for me to go back to school, I was late. I was feeling very bad because something happened that I could not keep my promise. I realized that I made a promise which I could not fulfill because I could not keep it. I was very sad. I felt guilty for breaking such an important promise to my sister. I went to my sister and apologized for making a promise which I could not keep. She appreciated my apology but I was shocked by the way she talked to me. She said: ‚ÄúI am the one who is responsible for myself and I can take care of everything, but the way you make promises orally and break them immediately because of one reason or another is not nice, and I don‚Äôt like it at all‚Äù}.\n\n\\section{Key}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A paragraph is a collection of sentences written in a logical order that tells a story, narrates an experience or explains a procedure.

        "output": "Design a simple training challenge on Strava that everyone could attend. I went with our local 15km Criterium in the Hagley Park‚Äôs of Christchurch as I wanted a simple event that all could attend and train for. When I mentioned cycling races people usually asked ‚ÄòHow long?‚Äô not ‚ÄòWhere?‚Äô That‚Äôs where Strava has been fantastic and has actually provided ‚ÄòHow Long?‚Äô data as well. There are still no ‚ÄòWhere?‚Äô details though if you are new to Strava. I used a route that was created with ‚ÄòMy Ride‚Äô and you can download to use in your own Garmin.\nThen it‚Äôs time to invite people to Strava Events and set a date and time when the first team will begin to ride.\nAs an added incentive on the first week, I asked participants what personal best (PB) they think is achievable for 15km in the Christchurch Criterium. There was a big range of guesses and it helped the competitive spirits of riders to have a little incentive. I had the first group start at midnight on the Sunday evening to get started so that it didn‚Äôt impact on daily routines.\nThe great thing is, Strava not only keeps track of your progress, but you can use it to help others track their progress. Our Facebook Group was the perfect place for our Strava Events to be promoted and advertised, and a forum where people could share their training progress. The more people that train, the more competitive the challenge becomes and this was a huge motivator for a lot of people.\nIt‚Äôs a massive help for many people to be able to participate in a Strava Challenge because they are more likely to achieve their ‚ÄòA‚Äô goal and also because all their training is visible to everyone. Not only does this make it easier to encourage people to keep training, but it also lets people see the progress of their friends, even over a 2-week period.\nWhat did a Strava Challenge help you achieve?\nAs we reached the final days before the event I could see that people had really taken to the challenge, and they started to post regular updates with their progress. The Facebook Group was a fantastic way for everyone to support each other and get encouragement.\nIn the final days before the event I had a few people tell me about their aches and pains and how their legs were feeling. I recommended checking them on Strava and I was super happy to see that even people that had been struggling the final few days were able to get some of those aches and pains under control by simply seeing how hard they were (or weren‚Äôt) training.\nOn the morning of the event, I was really pleased to get an update on Strava that someone had completed over 120km and I was expecting over 150 from other people, but I had under-estimated the fitness levels of the group. We had four people complete the full 15km distance on the day (even a couple that completed the total distance twice!) and that was a real testament to everyone‚Äôs fitness.\nWhile it‚Äôs a small sample of a large group of people, the Strava Challenge did seem to have an effect with 11 people achieving significant PB‚Äôs on the day (including the two who completed the event twice). But, the greatest achievement (in my opinion) was that everyone managed to get to the finish line of the event. That‚Äôs a testament to everyone‚Äôs training and their perseverance to complete a race against themselves, as a team, and against the rest of the world.\nWhat would you do to improve it?\nThe challenge is still ongoing 3 weeks later (and counting) which is a great testament of the training that people have put in. We still haven‚Äôt managed to get a time for the entire race but there will defintiely be new Strava PB‚Äôs broken this week (I believe there are 7 people with PB‚Äôs less than 14 mins from the current leader).\nThe only thing I‚Äôd like to improve on next time is the social media promotions. Next time, I‚Äôd run some Strava ads to make sure more people are made aware of the event.\nIf you‚Äôre interested in trying out a Strava Challenge, here are a few tips that I learnt from my experiences:\nGive yourself plenty of time to build a community of Strava users.\nMake sure you have a Facebook Group where people can support each other during the Challenge.\nBuild a clear framework for the weekly training session.\nUse Strava to share personal goals and milestones.\nUse Strava Segments and Sprints to inspire people to"

It really depends on the context, and the correct interpretation will depend on a bunch of factors.\n\nComment: Yes. In context, \"grammar\" is a singular word in the sense that the word \"grammar\" refers to only one thing. In this context, the singular is \"grammar\" and the plural is not used. Therefore, you should write \"grammar is ambiguous.\"\n\nAnswer: English is a flexible language and uses all of these definitions at different times and in different contexts. However, usually when we \"write what an object or concept is\", we are treating the object or concept as an entity (which are plural nouns unless they are words relating to people):\n\n\"Write what the noun is.\"\n\n\\em{\"An author is usually ambiguous, confusing, and obscure, but writing can help you to express yourself clearly.\"}\n\n\"Write the noun in a proper form.\"\n\n\\em{\"Wright the letter correctly: 'The' is capitalized, 'the' refers to more than one, and the word 'of' is used in a noun-phrase.\"}\n\n\"Write to somebody.\"\n\n\\em{\"To write is to communicate by letter or by email.\"}\n\n\"Write down what something is (in a note).\"\n\n\\em{\"I wrote the date of the birthday party on a post-it note.\"}\n\n\"Write something.\"\n\n\\em{\"Write a poem!\"}\n\n\"Write a letter.\"\n\n\\em{\"Write to your uncle about your day and what you did.\"}\n\nIn this answer, I have not used \\em{Ambiguous} very much, because it is a more generalized noun for any kind of ambiguity in a text and can not be used as a command alone:\n\n\"Be ambiguous!\"\n\n\\em{\"To be ambiguous means to use wording that causes the reader to consider multiple possibilities concerning what is meant.\"}\n\nComment: Please, do not write such answers here. They are just not for this site. If you write such long and detailed answer you can consider doing an essay, not a SO answer. The site is not for text books, it's about questions and answers, and this question can be answered in just two sentences, not 420 words long one.\n\nComment: OK, but what about _ambiguities_? \"The ambiguity is not clear in the document.\"\n\nComment: @Josh61 : \"To be unclear about meaning or intent.\"\n\nAnswer: I agree with those who say ambiguity is not a synonym for \"ungrammatical\". While it can be so, it's more accurate to say that ambiguity is a feature of a piece of grammar, the ambiguity in a sentence. Ambiguity in a sentence might be grammatical, though. For example\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhen is the next stop for this train?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nand\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhen is the next stop for this train?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nare both grammatical.\n\nIf it \\em{is} ungrammatical, the ambiguity will be ungrammatical, or it may be that the ambiguity will resolve into non-ambiguous alternative grammaticalities, or it may resolve into two different grammaticalities without ambiguity.\n\nFor example\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nYou can stop smoking if you want to.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nis grammatical and non-ambiguous but in order to make sense the ambiguity of whether the speaker means 'You can stop smoking by your own will if you want to' or 'You can stop smoking by smoking and then stopping'.\n\nAmbiguity can cause confusion or misunderstanding, especially if it's ungrammatical. But it need not; sentences can be ambiguous"

A time management checklist, free time management tips, articles and resources to help you overcome procrastination, distractions, and learn how to prioritize your work. To understand how to improve time management skills, first one must understand what time management is and what its essential components are.\nTime management is the discipline involved in planning and exercising control over the amount of time allocated to specific activities, especially to work. Time management includes planning, organizing, prioritizing and delegating on how to use your time more efficiently.\nTime management is the action or technique of planning and exercising control over the amount of time available to you, especially in regard to work and other life activities. Time management is usually achieved by making choices in order to do certain things at certain times.\nWhat are the 5 elements of time management? Time management is a skill that helps improve work performance, relieve stress and feel more in control of your daily life.\nWritten by Timothy D. You can start to improve time management skills by setting a clear schedule for yourself. When you complete a task, celebrate. Try to be happy for even the smallest accomplishment because it sets the tone for motivation and productivity in your future work tasks.\nBy rewarding yourself once you reach your goals, you can find more inspiration to take on subsequent challenging tasks as well as build the confidence to keep striving toward achieving your goals.\nThe more you set small goals, the greater self-esteem you will foster to help you work toward your larger dreams. Learn how to plan and set goals, prioritize your tasks and develop healthy habits that will help you manage your time better. Try the Time Management Plan, created by Dr. Setting SMART goals is a great way to stay accountable and measure your progress as you reach your goals. The goal setting process can be difficult for many people but you can significantly boost the chances of success by following a few steps and creating a plan to reach your goals.\nIt also pays to be specific, such as writing, for example, writing one article per week in your weekly goals. This is a much more concrete goal than just writing an article each month, and it will help you stay more focused on your tasks in order to achieve your more substantial goals.\nGetting organized can be a huge stress reliever that will make it much easier to manage your time and set your priorities.

        "output": "How can I increase my productivity while working from home? Here are some tips for achieving success while working from a home office.\nIn a recent study by Stanford University, researchers found that a large majority of employees (67%) say their focus is not strong ‚Äî and more than 25% are completely inattentive to their work.\nStay active. Exercise can be a wonderful way to boost your energy levels ‚Äî and your self-esteem. Not only do physical activities release endorphins that make you feel better, but they provide a great means to distract you from problems that are making you feel less than productive. Exercise provides a break from difficult tasks, and can help you focus more positively on the work you need to accomplish later. Consider finding time for physical activity several times during your workday, such as a walk around the block or some time spent strengthening your core at a nearby fitness studio.\nHave a plan. Many successful working mothers have strategies for staying on track, regardless of the challenges they face. You can create your own organizational system and work habits that help you stay on track and make smart decisions. As you build your routine and develop your plan, consider these tips:\nEstablish clear goals. Define your goals each week, and make them flexible, such as ‚Äúwork for 6 hours‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwork eight hours,‚Äù which can make your goals seem overwhelming.\nGet enough rest. Many factors can have a negative effect on your sleep, such as stress, hectic work schedules, or the loss of a significant amount of sleep due to an emergency or a sick child at home. To keep you sharp and focused, be sure you get a good night‚Äôs sleep several times each week.\nKeep distractions to a minimum. Distractions can get in the way of productivity, whether your toddler is begging for a snack, you feel an intense urge to respond to a text, or you get pulled into a debate with a colleague about an email. It‚Äôs important to keep distractions to a minimum so you can stay on track, and make sure your working space is free from clutter so that you can get things done quickly and efficiently.\nRoll with the punches. In almost any line of work, problems will arise. The key to productivity is how you react to those challenges. If you‚Äôre feeling burned out or stressed, it‚Äôs sometimes best to relax and take a break before diving back in and trying to work through challenges. Consider giving yourself permission to step back when you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, and then return at a later time to tackle a difficult task. When challenges arise, it can be wise to ask a friend, spouse, or coworker for support and feedback, and take advice along.\nDon‚Äôt make work the only thing you focus on. When you work only on business, you can lose sight of everything that matters in life ‚Äî and that can make you feel burned out and overwhelmed. To help you avoid that type of exhaustion, make sure you take time to do things that bring enjoyment into your life. Even 15 minutes spent reading a book during your lunch hour, listening to music, or taking a quick walk can provide an energetic boost and help you feel refreshed and ready to tackle challenges at work.\nBy establishing priorities, planning ahead, and taking care of yourself, you can improve your productivity while working from home.\nWhat a business needs to be ‚Äòready‚Äô for an outbreak\nFrom time to time companies do business in areas prone to natural disasters - hurricanes, tornadoes, fire, earthquakes and flooding. Preparation, proper training and planning can make all the difference in the event of an emergency. Here's what a business needs to be 'ready' in the event of an outbreak.\nFunding: It could be the difference between a temporary setback or permanent closure. Business interruption insurance can be purchased to help companies continue to earn income while recovering from disasters. Business interruption insurance covers loss of profits and extra expenses when business is interrupted by a covered peril.\nBacking up important files is key. Businesses may want to consider creating a \"disaster recovery plan,\" which is a process that documents how employees and systems will respond in an emergency. Businesses can also work with trusted IT consultants to create detailed recovery plans specific to their business.\nStaff training: Above all else, employees need to be prepared to respond during a disaster.

But what we need to do is understand the basic principles behind it. We can use those principles to build systems to solve problems. - The basics of quantum computing are this is a different way of understanding the problem that we‚Äôre trying to solve rather than the classical approach of binary zeros and ones, which is how we do it traditionally. - In a quantum computer, we‚Äôre going to be using quantum bits - basically, we‚Äôre going to be using a superposition of a zero and a one. We‚Äôre going to be able to use that to do certain calculations or processes that a traditional computer wouldn‚Äôt be able to do. - One example is Shor‚Äôs algorithm to solve primality testing - now a lot of people don‚Äôt really understand this one so it‚Äôs a little hard to describe but we‚Äôre actually going to be using that as part of this workshop today. There‚Äôs more information you can find about that on Wikipedia. üåüüåüüåüüåü - The difference between a quantum computing and a traditional computer - in a traditional computer we use bits‚Ä¶ zeros and ones - in a classical computer they‚Äôre used to store or represent information - but we have to keep that information in a very exact state - and a state‚Äôs made of energy - we have to basically expend energy or consume it in order to keep that information in a state so that‚Ä¶ in order for it to be usable or stored somewhere - what happens in a quantum computer - we use a quantum bit, or qubit - a single qubit can be a 0 or it can be a 1 - we can think that it‚Äôs not really there until we turn it on or turn it off - so it can be both 0 and 1 at the same time - and that‚Äôs how it differs from traditional computers where bits can only be one or the other - so the problem with traditional computers is that in order to represent information we can only use discrete states because in any state other than that zero or one we end up losing information - now a quantum computer, a qubit‚Ä¶ because it can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time, we can have much more information stored in a given qubit‚Ä¶ the information is stored without losing any information - so in that way we can store more information and we can access it faster - that‚Äôs the advantage of a quantum computer as opposed to a traditional computer üó£üó£What are we trying to achieve by implementing quantum computing in Canada? üåüüåüüåüüåü - Canada has been very active in quantum computing research - and recently also in commercializing quantum computers - Canada is actually one of the first countries in the world to introduce a policy that specifically focuses on quantum computing research - we have an ‚ÄúAction Plan for Quantum Information and Technology‚Äù - this was announced in 2016 as part of the federal government‚Äôs strategic science and innovation plan - Canada aims to be the first G7 country to implement a fully operational quantum computing network - and so Canada is actively trying to create an environment that will allow Canadian researchers to advance their research, commercialize their breakthroughs, and establish Canada as a world leader - Canada‚Äôs current priority areas for quantum computing are in information technology and security - so we‚Äôre interested in developing secure communications and encryption with quantum computers - one application that is highly relevant for Canada is in remote sensing - satellites need to transmit images and data back here so there‚Äôs a lot of use of bandwidth and that‚Äôs a big area where we need to improve our technology - that‚Äôs also something that Canadian companies are interested in developing for the military and for other markets - Canada aims to also be a leader in developing other applications of quantum computing, including finance and medicine - finance for example is really interesting‚Ä¶ using a quantum computer we would have a faster way of doing calculations and developing new algorithms, especially for risk assessment - for example, in traditional risk assessment you do Monte Carlo simulations where you have to do a certain number of trials in order to assess the probability of something - with a quantum computer you can do more trials at the same time or with less trials, and use the results to develop a model faster, so we can get better quality results - another example is in medicine‚Ä¶ for pharmaceutical companies, they‚Äôre using quantum computers to try to simulate different molecules in order to develop new medications - they can also use it to try to develop new treatments"

CITIZEN PREPARATION GUIDE iii GENERAL KNOWLEDGE You have only seconds - perhaps minutes - to successfully respond to a threat in your community. If you have previously considered but not yet acted to prepare yourself, your family, and your pets, now is the time to finally take those steps. If you are fully prepared you can help save lives. PREPARE NOW: Avoid panic. Be alert and aware of your surroundings. Follow the instructions of police and emergency medical personnel. Do not call 9-1-1 unless it is an emergency; it is extremely important to allow the police to handle the situation. Keep your family and pets together and safe. Check water and food supplies. Determine what emergency supplies you need. Make a list of emergency supplies needed, then gather them. Store additional supplies in a place accessible only by first responders. Make a list of family and friend s , emergency contacts, and other important information. Take photos and videos, if possible. Make sure all emergency contact information is current. Review disaster preparedness guidelines with your family and neighbors. If you have pets, do not forget them . If you evacuate, take your pets with you or make plans ahead of time for finding emergency shelter that accepts your pets. Make a list of all your medications, including any you take daily or that you need immediately in an emergency. Gather important medical information, such as your doctor s name, medical conditions, medicine allergies , and other health information. Have at least two weeks worth of medicine on hand If you require medical equipment, have an extra supply with you. If you have a specialized diet, provide for at least a two-week supply. Keep a list of all important documents in an easy-to-find place. This can include information such as your name, address, birth date, Social Security number, passport numbers , driver s license numbers, and emergency contacts (family, friends) If you have a car, make sure it has enough fuel to get you where you need to go If you have a special need, consider registering for services through the emergency management office in your community. Make sure your family members and neighbors understand that disabilities do not necessarily prevent individuals from saving their lives and the lives of others. PREPARE NOW: If you live in a disaster-prone area, consider preparing an emergency supply kit: Bottled water, canned foods, medication, first aid kit, flashlight, batteries, non-perishable food, copies of important documents (birth certificates, driver s licenses, marriage certificates, etc.) If you have pets, also consider preparing a pet disaster supply kit: Food (at least 14 days worth), bowls, cat litter box, muzzles, leashes/harness , vaccination and medical records , copies of photo IDs , copies of pet insurance policies and first aid kit including bandages, scissors, and tweezers If you evacuate, take your pets with you or make plans ahead of time for finding emergency shelter that accepts your pets. Stay home, shelter in place If you are near an emerging flood, tornado, or wildfire, or anywhere you feel unsafe: If indoors,"

Explain the potential implication of using a single-use plastic bottle on human health. 2. The Impact on the Environment In the 20th century, the United States saw an increase in consumerism including a spike in the number of single-use plastic bottles and packaging items. This, in turn, had a huge impact on the environment. A study by the World Economic Forum noted that single-use plastics make up a major portion of the ocean‚Äôs pollution levels. Over 8.3 billion tonnes of plastics had already polluted ocean environments in 2015, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. The World Economic Forum also calculated that if we continued to pollute the oceans at the same rate, we would add another 120,000 kilograms to the volume of plastics every minute. However, there are ways to reduce your usage of disposable plastics. While shopping, use reusable bags or cloth bags. Instead of buying bottled water, use a reusable water bottle. When you go to the bathroom, carry your own cotton towels to cut down on plastic. Also, when you buy products, try to purchase locally to reduce your carbon footprint. 3.

According to a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report (2010), healthcare information technology has great potential to reduce healthcare costs, improve patient safety, and ensure accurate processing of claims and insurance eligibility. Adoption of information technologies is likely to take many years, with the most rapid growth expected in the adoption of electronic health records.

The use of information technology can help improve the quality of health care and allows for efficient care delivery, as well as reducing costs associated with health care. Health care information technology can improve patient care, lower costs, increase provider productivity, and improve quality, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). There are many ways in which health care information technology can help improve patient care. One way is by providing clinicians with easy and timely access to information. Clinicians can have access to patient information via electronic medical records and via personal digital assistants and smart phones. This allows the clinician to access vital information (such as patient histories, diagnostic test results, medications, and treatment plans) in a timely manner and can help reduce the chance of errors or duplication of services (RWJF). Another way in which information technology can help improve patient care is by improving communication between patients, providers, and payers. Electronic health records (EHRs) can make patient information more accessible by providing a shared electronic record accessible by the patient, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers. These records give the patient an opportunity to better manage their own health,......\nWk 2 Healthcare Information\n...Health Care Information Paper Health care information has been a significant focus since the beginning of the electronic age in the United States.

Kelleher Contact your instructor if you have questions or need help. The purpose of this assignment is for you to understand how governments use fiscal and monetary policy to combat recessions. Also, you should have the ability to interpret aggregate demand and its effect on real output and employment. Finally, you should understand real gross domestic product and the potential and limitations of using policy to raise aggregate demand should the economy slide into a recession. If you have not already done so, please review the syllabus on ‚ÄúEconomic Growth and Business Cycles‚Äù. Then, please proceed as follows. Part I: Aggregate Demand and Cyclical Fluctuations The aggregate demand curve (AD) and its components are shown below. (Click here to review the AD curve and its components.) How do these key components affect aggregate demand and employment? As an example, use the ‚ÄúU.S. Economic and Employment Data‚Äù spreadsheet provided to answer these questions: ‚ÄúHow would aggregate demand (real GDP) and employment have changed as the housing market (housing starts) cycled over the past 10 years? How would AD and employment be different today if the federal government had not stepped in to assist the economy?‚Äù You may use the data provided for the spreadsheet as well as any publicly available data to answer these questions. You are encouraged to submit all data that you have used in your worksheet to your instructor in order to avoid plagiarism allegations. Use at least three different data sources, including at least one publicly available source. Please make sure that your response is thorough and addresses all parts of the question. You may want to reference the slides from Bloom, Best, and Kehoe (Chapter 22), or you could use other reference sources to do so. In addition, please answer the following questions in your response: 1. Describe the relationship between changes in the real exchange rate and net exports. 2. Describe two ways governments can influence aggregate demand in the short run, and two ways they can influence aggregate demand in the long run. 3. You have just been tapped to present your ideas of how fiscal policy can be used to ‚Äúget the economy moving again.‚Äù In preparation, you have researched the government‚Äôs ability to manage aggregate demand, and the limitations it faces. Now present your ideas on how fiscal policy has addressed (or might address) the Great Recession using examples, statistics, research, and any other information in your responses above. Consider the following: 1. What are some examples of actions that both the U.S. federal government and a state government could take to stimulate aggregate demand? 2. What are some real-world examples of policies that have stimulated aggregate demand? 3. Considering the limitations of fiscal policy mentioned above, what are some examples in history where fiscal policy failed to improve economic performance, or where governments actually made this situation worse? Part II: Monetary Policy Monetary policy is the ‚Äústrategy a country‚Äôs central bank adopts to guide interest rates and the money supply in order to achieve specific goals,‚Äù such as sustainable economic growth. (Source: Wikipedia) In this section, you will describe the responsibilities and goals of an ideal monetary policy tool, and how it implements and addresses changes in economic activity. You will then describe both the quantitative and qualitative methods that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) uses in communicating its goals and direction, and how it implements monetary policy tools to achieve these goals.

        "output": "How do language and cultural barriers affect the way people communicate and form relationships in multicultural societies? Language and cultural differences can often cause barriers in relationships, and communication. However, these barriers must be dealt with in a positive light in order to improve relationships across cultures. These cultures can be from two different individuals, two different couples, two different families or even two different organizations. These obstacles will be overcome when one or more of the parties takes a positive approach to resolving the barriers in communication. One would think that in a multicultural society where there are a lot of different cultures, people and organizations, there wouldn‚Äôt be any barriers in communication since everybody knows each other‚Äôs languages. However, language and cultural barriers can be as big of a set back as one might think. Cultural and language barriers can create obstacles in the delivery of information, the understanding of information, and the interpretation of information. Some examples of these barriers that can exist between organizations include the understanding of specific business or government language, or the understanding and interpretation of business or government ethics. These barriers can sometimes be too big for some people to overcome. Some people might feel their backgrounds are too different and this might create a sense of anxiety for some people that could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships. However, if people take a positive approach to overcoming these barriers by building and maintaining relationships on common grounds and by understanding and appreciating diversity, the barriers to communication can be overcome and result in good relationships and positive outcomes. A good relationship needs to consist of trust, respect and understanding. People need to be honest and open with each other if they want to build a successful relationship. When someone trusts and respects their interactions with others, barriers in communication will decrease and relationships will improve. People sometimes don‚Äôt say things the way they intend things to be said when they are communicating in a different language than the other person. When people think the other person understands but they do not, this can cause misunderstandings and friction. However, if people take extra time to communicate their feelings and thoughts thoroughly, they can avoid many misunderstandings that they may have with the other person. These relationships will last much longer if...\nWhat Are the Causes of Language and Cultural Barriers in the Classroom?\n...What are the causes of language and cultural barriers in the classroom? There are several causes that have an impact on language and cultural barriers in the classroom, including demographics, expectations and communication. A classroom is made up of many students who come from different ethnic backgrounds depending on where they live, which often results in language and cultural barriers. Demographics refers to a set of characteristics like race, gender and age that are used to describe members of a target audience, often for market research purposes (\"Psychology, n.d.). One demographic of the school classroom is the age of the students in the classroom. Children that are younger often depend on their parents to help them communicate with the teacher. When the child moves into a new classroom and starts to learn a new language, they often begin to cling to their parents in an effort to feel safe and secure with a new teacher (\"How Does the Demographics of a Classroom Affect Teaching?,\" 2010). Some students and parents might view the teacher as an enemy rather than someone who can help the student. This is not a good situation for either the teacher or the student. Another issue related to demographics is the number of different languages spoken by the children in the classroom. There are several languages spoken by children living in the United...\nLanguage: A Universal Process Essay\n...Language: A Universal Process There are six main principles for language acquisition. These are: -\tUniversal grammar -\tSensitive Period -\tEmergentism -\tMeaning-based -\tMonitoring and Negotiation -\tUniversal Grammar Universal grammar is that the grammar of a language will be the same for every language. This is because grammatical structure is a universal rule, even though the languages are different, they are both ruled by the same grammatical rules. For example, one grammatical rule is that a pronoun is subject, object, predicate nominative, etc. In English, we add an ‚Äòs‚Äò to make a pronoun subject. We can change the ‚Äòs‚Äò to make it a subject and object, e.g. ‚Äòhe‚Äò and ‚Äòhim‚Äò. In a sentence such as, ‚Äòhe saw him,‚Äô the word ‚Äòhim‚Äô is an object, meaning the pronoun ‚Äòhim‚Äô follows the verb ‚Äòsaw‚Äô and is connected to the noun ‚Äòhim‚Äô.

This does not mean that myths are without basis or without truth since they are grounded and supported by human experience, values, culture and philosophy. Myths are seen by historians and scholars as \"a means of understanding the world by connecting it with a larger conceptual and symbolic framework.\" Myths, then, are representations of reality as perceived by a person, a community, a culture or groups of communities that share in a common belief system. Myths, historically speaking, evolve to become part of a cultural system from which they originated and continue to survive by giving people a sense of belonging, identity and purpose.

        "output": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity? How long does immunity last? Which vaccines are essential for protecting the individual and which are essential for protecting the whole community? The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in 2017 that smallpox was the first infectious disease to be completely wiped out as a threat to humanity. The eradication of a disease is an international health achievement that can have an enormous impact on the health and wellbeing of communities. The vaccine for smallpox provided individuals and communities with a protective shield against infection and death for nearly two hundred years. But, this vaccine was only effective if administered to more than 80 percent of the population of an area, which was referred to as the ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù of a community. The herd immunity strategy effectively protected individuals if it was in place in all populations; however, the strategy was not widely implemented in every community, resulting in infections and deaths. Today, smallpox no longer exists in natural ecologies anywhere in the world, meaning that the infectious agents that cause the disease have been completely removed from the environment. Once a disease has been eradicated, the vaccine associated with the disease should be used for the purpose of controlling outbreaks if that particular disease were to reestablish itself in nature; however, due to the low level of risk associated with smallpox, it has been determined that vaccines will not be necessary following the disease‚Äôs eradication because it is unlikely that it will reestablish itself globally. This does not mean, however, that outbreaks of smallpox are impossible. In fact, during the last decade, small pox was detected among monkeys in Yunnan Province in southern China. Fortunately, the infected monkeys were being used for research. However, smallpox is capable of changing host organisms and could eventually pose a threat to human populations. A similar scenario took place in South America in 1992, when researchers detected the disease in humans who were vaccinated many years previously. This case study proved that it is essential to maintain vaccine supplies in case of a reestablishment of smallpox in the wild.\nDifferent Ways of Connoting ‚ÄúHumane‚Äù\nDifferent Ways of Connoting ‚ÄúHumane‚Äù The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines the word ‚Äúhumane‚Äù as a synonym for words with meanings such as ‚Äúkind‚Äù and ‚Äúcompassionate.‚Äù Humane is also described as ‚Äúthe quality or state of being humane; benevolence and kind sympathy, esp. towards the suffering or less fortunate; considerate or compassionate behavior; not cruel, inhuman, or lacking in pity or sympathy.‚Äù The OED also connotes ‚Äúhumane‚Äù as being ‚Äúhaving to do with, or noting conditions suitable for, humans.‚Äù These two definitions provide insight on the numerous ways that ‚Äúhumane‚Äù can be connoted. For example, the OED uses the word ‚Äúnot cruel‚Äù when describing the first definition. This shows that ‚Äúhumane‚Äù can indicate the absence of certain negative characteristics, as expressed in the sentence ‚ÄúHe tried to be compassionate when confronting his patients about their poor health habits, but he often found himself lashing out when confronted with their refusal to listen to what he was saying.‚Äù This connoted meaning of ‚Äúhumane‚Äù indicates that the speaker of the sentence believes that the doctor is being kind and sympathetic, but his demeanor and disposition is not being ‚Äúhumane‚Äù and kindness is being expressed in an unkind manner because of the doctor‚Äôs anger. The sentence also implies that the way that the doctor communicated with his patients was not ‚Äúhuman like‚Äù or in a manner that would appeal to them. The statement that ‚Äúhe is not cruel‚Äù indicates that the behavior of the aforementioned doctor is unhumane and lacks compassion and consideration, resulting in the anger of the doctor‚Äôs patients. This statement reveals that the doctor‚Äôs manner of treatment with his patients is ‚Äúcruel‚Äù and that he is being ‚Äúunhumane‚Äù in his interactions with his patients. This also shows that the doctor is not being benevolent or ‚Äúkind‚Äù towards his patients and this is why the patients felt angered and upset by the behavior of the doctor. The OED also utilizes the sentence ‚Äúhaving to do with or noting conditions suitable for humans‚Äù when connoting the other meaning of the word ‚Äúhumane.‚Äù One example of the word ‚Äúhum"

What steps might you take to develop both your leadership and your management skills?\nThe goal of this assignment is to determine ways in which you might lead and manage in ways that promote shared decision-making, collaboration and commitment. Throughout his book In Search of Excellence, Tom Peters writes that a leader must have ‚Äúhigh emotional intelligence.‚Äù He writes, ‚Äúthe best leaders work in the service of great purposes and bring passion, commitment, and love into their work. The best leaders are people who are so excited about the good they can do‚Äîthe way they can make the world a better place‚Äîthat their enthusiasm is contagious. . . . People are willing to follow leaders with high emotional intelligence. A great leader‚Äîwho combines the strengths of the five traits of emotional intelligence‚Äîhas the potential to inspire a powerful team that will help the organization achieve greatness‚Äù (Peters, 1997, p. 240).\nWith this in mind, think about a time when you led and managed your team in shared decision-making, collaboration and commitment. Describe the situation and how you might have applied some of these leadership skills. Write a 700‚Äì1,050-word paper in which you do the following:\nSummarize the situation and the way in which you worked effectively with your team as a leader and manager.\nReflect on the ways in which you may have demonstrated good leadership and management skills during this situation. Provide evidence to support your reflection.\nDifferentiate between the skills involved in good leadership and those involved in good management.\nExplain why shared decision-making, collaboration and commitment are important qualities in a team leader or manager.\nYou can download the PDF version of The Roles of a Successful School Administrator 1.5 Scoring Guide here for free."

I am curious about people's motivations and behaviours. That curiosity keeps me always wanting to learn more about people's perspectives and actions. In my opinion, the world will have more respect for women, the environment and each other, when more people get involved and care. I love taking part in various activities to contribute to my own happiness and then the happiness of others too. Everyone can make a difference in their own unique way, whether it's by sharing their time, talents or even just their stories. Our greatest glory consists not in never falling but in rising every time we fall. - Confucius My greatest strength would be to be kind. - Dalai Lama 3 Being persistent and patient is my greatest strength. It takes patience to achieve success and it also takes patience to keep believing in yourself. Sometimes when we are trying to achieve something, it may not work out as soon as you hope or expect, which is understandably discouraging. However, by persisting and remaining patient we can keep trying and eventually find the path to our goals. - Maya Angelou Every day, in every way, I get better and better. - Ralph Waldo Emerson Failure is a success in progress. - Albert Einstein Don't be afraid of failing. Be afraid of not trying. - Shonda Rhimes 9 When faced with obstacles, never lose sight of your dreams or goals. Always keep your eyes fixed on the light at the end of the tunnel and it will become brighter and brighter as you get closer to achieving your dreams and goals.- Oprah Winfrey I'm going to make mistakes. I'm going to be wrong a lot of the time on the way to doing something new. To be honest, I am more worried about what I could have done with this time I have been given on this Earth rather than what I have not done. - Richard Branson 6 When you hit a stumbling block or you feel you can't go on, jump up and shout \"AH, AH! I forgot I wasn't afraid!\" - Dale Carnegie 2 Being able to adapt and adjust to change is my greatest strength. Sometimes when we are learning and growing it can be disruptive and even scary, but we can use these changes to become stronger and more resilient for the future. In life, there will be many ups and downs. By being able to adjust to and accept the changes in our lives we will become mentally stronger and more resilient against future challenges in whatever form they may take. - Michael Jordan 8 My greatest strength as a person is my ability to learn and progress even after I make mistakes. It can be really disappointing when you make a mistake or do something you are not proud of, but by learning from both our successes and our mistakes, we can continually grow and improve as people. The only real mistake is not learning from past mistakes and carrying forward that negative baggage to the future. - Brian Buffini 1 Being a good coach is my greatest strength in business. As well as being an experienced business owner, I also have a coaching background and an insatiable appetite for learning and development that helps me to"

As parents you may want to know if your Child has a reading, writing, or spelling problem by the time he or she reaches eighth grade. Many educators believe a student is likely to have a reading, writing, or spelling difficulty if the student does either of the following: 1. has difficulty learning to read and spell. (This could include having a slow, inaccurate, or inconsistent rate of word recognition.) 2. has difficulty understanding or processing information that he or she has read. (This could include having difficulty understanding or remembering what he or she has read, and difficulty making inferences.) If either of the following situations describes your child, you may want to have him or her evaluated for a possible reading, writing, or spelling disorder: 1. Has your child ever been diagnosed by a doctor or other professional with a learning disability, a health problem, or some other condition that may have affected his or her ability to learn to read and spell? No If yes, what was the diagnosis? Date? Name of doctor or professional? 2. Does your child have any of the following difficulties that affect learning or spelling? Yes No 3. In my opinion, the following statements are correct: YES NO 4. Please make a check mark (x) in the blank below that best describes your child s present ability to: read, sound out words, and spell. a. Understand what is read. b. Remember what is read. c. Read fluently and quickly. d. Spell correctly. e. Write clearly. f. Combine words into correct sentences. g. Write quickly. h. Make spelling errors. i. Copy or write neatly. j. Organize thoughts when writing. k. Understand textbooks and articles. l. Use punctuation correctly. 5. Make a statement about your child s spelling ability on the rating scale below that best describes your child. My Child s Rating Is: 6. My child has all of the following strengths in learning to read and spell. Make a check mark (X) in the blank below that best describes your child s strengths. a. Speaks clearly. b. Is imaginative. c. Is enthusiastic. d. Is self-confident. e. Is willing to take risks. f. Has a good memory for factual information and details. g. Is a good listener. h. Works well and diligently. i. Is punctual. 6\n37 REPEAT QUESTIONNARIES AT THREE YEAR AGE LEVELS, AVERAGE THE RESULTS. CHECK THE BOX TO INDICATE WHETHER YOU FOLLOW THIS RULE. No Yes Recommended 1. Do not collect questionnaires for children younger than 6 years old. 2. If you are collecting questionnaires for two siblings 6 years and younger, average the results for the two children. If the average score of the two children is in the high average range, the child may be showing signs of a learning problem. If the average score for two siblings is below one of the referral range, the results indicate a possible learning problem. The younger child may benefit from an evaluation or intervention at this time. If this is the case, follow the procedures in this manual for evaluating and intervening with young students. 3. If you have collecting questionnaires for two children who are 6-8 years old, average the results for these two children. If one child has a reading, writing, or spelling difficulty, and the other sibling does not, the two siblings may be different in basic abilities. When this happens, it is more difficult to predict which sibling will have reading, writing, or spelling difficulties, should the siblings follow the same educational and home settings. These results may also indicate that both children need additional information. At that time you can decide whether to follow the same procedures as described in previous sections of this manual, or to follow the procedures described for students in high school in later sections of this manual. 7\n39 RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT STUDENTS WITH LDs AND OTHER PROFILING CONDITIONS NEEDS SPECIFIC TEACHING STRATEGIES THAT ADDRESS THEIR INDIVIDUAL LEARNING DIFFIC"

Often, there are subtle body language cues, as well as other signs, that can help you spot a liar. While anyone can learn how to detect a lie, certain people have a natural knack for spotting the various behaviours a lie may involve. In addition to knowing how to tell if someone is lying, it‚Äôs important to understand that a person‚Äôs body language does not always give you a definitive answer. You also can‚Äôt expect to spot a lie in every situation. So take a look at these tips, which can help you spot a possible liar, but also understand that you may have to rely on other clues to fully understand what is happening with someone. Here Are 10 Tips for Acing Body Language A good place to begin to examine someone‚Äôs behaviour is to look at their body language. While body language is not always a perfect representation of a person‚Äôs true feelings and emotions, it can serve as one of the best indicators of possible deceit, as well as general emotional state. When looking at someone‚Äôs body language, it is also important to examine both the big and small details, as well as the emotions being displayed. If you notice that a person is avoiding eye contact, that their voice is low or quiet, or they appear guarded and unsure of what to say, these can all be signs that they may be hiding something. Other clues to look for include: Avoiding making eye contact Making a person lean too far away or too far towards you Clutching a person or object tightly Moving unnaturally or nervously Mumbling, stuttering, or speaking more slowly Swallowing frequently Having a dazed look on their face Displaying anger Pulling away from you Speaking quickly with a high volume Avoiding answering questions Direct and focused eye contact A relaxed posture Avoiding fidgety movements Smiling, laughing more naturally If you see any of these behaviours, they may be a sign that a person is hiding something or that they may be uncomfortable with their current situation. It‚Äôs also important to remember that simply being nervous isn‚Äôt always a sign of deceit. Sometimes a person may be hesitant or unsure of what to say because they are unfamiliar with the situation. Other times, it could be because they are nervous about what may be discussed. While these signs may be a hint that a person is hiding something, be sure to dig deeper to find out the possible reasons. The more you know about a person and the situation, the better you can determine if he or she is being sincere. 11 Signs of a Lying Body Language When a person is lying, he or she will usually display one or more of the following body language signs: Leaning away from the person they are talking to Avoiding making eye contact Pursing their lips Moving around restlessly Crossing their arms Leaning, sitting or standing in a defensive position Swallowing repeatedly Tapping or fidgeting more often than usual Folding their arms or hugging them against their chest These signs are typically obvious and may provide a red flag that a person is lying. However, keep in mind that any of these signs can also occur because a person is nervous or uncomfortable, or if other reasons exist. Be sure to take all of these clues into consideration, as well as any other cues or clues that you see. For example, you may notice that someone lies with their left hand on their chest, which could indicate a higher degree of anxiety. Understanding this personality trait will help you more fully understand the person and the situation. This will also give you a better understanding of how a person typically reacts, offering insight into how a person may be reacting to the present situation. For example, if you notice that a person normally folds their arms,"

        "instruction": "Why might someone choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead of relying on a GPS device or smartphone app?",
        "output": "Why might someone choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead of relying on a GPS device or smartphone app? When faced with a problem that requires the skills and knowledge that a paper map and/or a friendly conversation can provide, people choose to use these things over a computer program. Some questions a paper map can answer include: Will I need an alternate route? What is the best route? Who can provide the most accurate information? A paper map or other form of knowledge can save time and energy that would be spent trying to figure out how to get somewhere on a screen which could have an outdated or incorrect answer.\nA good friend is someone you can turn to for a variety of situations or questions. When asked for directions, a friend could provide the most accurate or best route to where you are going, along with advice about how to get there or a tip to avoid road construction or heavy traffic. While GPS directions cannot provide advice, they can still lead you to your destination. Often, a person who chooses to ask for directions will also ask the person for advice about the location or recommend a restaurant or activity in or near that destination. This can be more convenient than searching through a list of recommendations on a website, but a friend can provide advice based on your previous preferences or personal experiences.\nBecause paper maps and friends require human interaction and provide an actual experience (rather than a simple visual image) to provide information, they still have a place in today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world. They help you avoid being locked-in by a GPS or smartphone when you find a better, more direct route to get to where you want to go.\nTagged digital-services, gps, paper-maps, technology-devices\nDriving With GPS-Systems: Knowing the Risks\nAre GPS devices safe to use while driving? Recently, several deaths related to driver distraction have been attributed to automotive GPS systems. How can you be sure that you‚Äôre not one of the next victims of distracted driving?\nThe Risk of Driver Distraction\nIn the past few months, a number of automotive GPS systems have been implicated in fatal automotive accidents. A young girl lost her life after drifting off course in the middle of a bridge. A driver was killed after staring at his GPS while going 195 km/h. These stories serve as stark reminders of the consequences of distracted driving, especially when it comes to GPS usage in automobiles. Whether it‚Äôs accidentally changing the destination while driving or staring at a bright screen for several minutes while attempting to follow directions, the temptation to become distracted while using a GPS is strong. Unfortunately, all it takes is a minute or two of inattentiveness to trigger a deadly accident.\nKnowing the Risk\nIf you have a GPS system in your car, then you‚Äôre far from the first driver to do so. More than 80% of drivers have a GPS or a smartphone app like Google Maps to help them plan a route or find their way around an unfamiliar area. While it may seem safe and convenient to use GPS while driving, it can also be a serious hazard.\nMany drivers think that using just one hand to type in a destination or to tap on an app icon means that they aren‚Äôt taking their eyes off the road. However, a handheld GPS system still distracts drivers, and even a simple task like tapping on an app icon can cause a fatal accident. To keep your attention where it should be, it‚Äôs necessary to leave your smartphone in the backseat or a secure case in the trunk wherever possible and to use voice commands to perform GPS functions.\nIf possible, it‚Äôs also safer to pull over and stop before looking at your GPS or smartphone app. If you need to plan your next route ahead of time, then it‚Äôs best to stop altogether when you‚Äôre done with the mapping rather than looking at your device while in motion.\nIf you do choose to drive using GPS, then keep the following safety principles in mind to avoid distracted driving accidents:\nOnly use GPS or apps when necessary\nWhen you don‚Äôt need to look at your GPS or smartphone, then turn it off or put it away\nUse voice-command features, when available, to avoid looking at the device\nAdjust speed when driving out of traffic\nDon‚Äôt follow GPS directions when you haven‚Äôt looked at the map first; it‚Äôs much easier to follow a route when you have it planned ahead of time\nStop your vehicle when you need to look at your GPS or other tech device\nIf you‚Äôre"

        "output": "Why might someone prefer to shop at a small, locally-owned business instead of a large chain store, even if the prices are higher?\nLifestyle: Shopping at a smaller store allows shoppers to get more face time and personalized service. Often, staff members know the shoppers and their preferences by name, which improves the overall experience and increases customer loyalty.\nAmenities: Large retail chain stores cannot always compete with the extras that little mom-and-pop shops can offer, like convenient parking, a pet-friendly environment, or a friendly staff that knows the neighborhood and can offer personalized advice. Small businesses also tend to have more unique products or services that match the lifestyle of local customers. For example, a resident of the Pacific Beach area might prefer a yoga studio that offers classes near the beach, or a coffee shop that serves organic drinks without additives or preservatives.\nUnique Products: Large retail chains can sometimes lose the magic of a smaller location that makes its products or services special. Shoppers who frequent local boutiques might find it easier to discover new items within a small space, or may enjoy getting one-on-one feedback or personalized help from the store‚Äôs staff. Shoppers who buy products or services from mom-and-pop shops might get the feeling that they have found a genuinely unique item that cannot be found anywhere else, or that they were able to get a truly personal product selection that they cannot find across the city or elsewhere. Sometimes, it may be difficult for larger stores to offer these things, or even impossible.\nCommunity: Shopping at a local store supports the community and local economies, in a direct and more immediate way, by promoting growth and prosperity. When locals purchase things, not only do they help a small business thrive, but they get to engage directly with their neighbors and community members, building a social fabric that can strengthen the overall community. When people shop at local businesses, they also have a better chance of influencing positive change in the town or neighborhood by supporting efforts to reduce pollution, improve public education, or address social issues.\nWhen people buy things from a local store, they often become part of the store‚Äôs regular customer base, and the staff often grows to know the customer by name, often greeting them warmly and offering personalized assistance. In this way, it feels like a community, with everyone knowing everyone and looking out for each other. It is often more rewarding to be a part of a community this way, especially because locals often know which stores offer the best value or have the best deals.\nFor example, residents of Pacific Beach may prefer to buy products or use services at a store locally owned and operated for their community events and parties. The benefits of supporting local businesses, such as a more personalized shopping experience or improved sense of community, can be quite substantial to some shoppers.\nMany people also value aesthetics when choosing a place to shop, and may prefer buying items in a clean, organized, and pleasant environment. The visual appeal of a small, locally-owned shop may also appeal to people who want to find products in attractive surroundings, or who prefer to support businesses that invest in their surroundings, often offering more pleasant landscaping, or a brighter or cleaner interior, than a large retailer. Additionally, many people enjoy supporting brick-and-mortar stores located in their neighborhoods, in a way that is not possible with an online business that needs only an address to ship orders.\nIn some cases, consumers may even be willing to pay more for goods or services at a small, local business that they value because of the personalized attention and sense of community they offer. Shoppers may believe that the higher prices they pay help to support businesses that have a positive impact on the local community. Overall, when people buy their products or services from local businesses, it often feels better than a purchase from a large chain or store.\nTaxes: Consumers often benefit from more tax revenue when shopping locally, due in part to the fact that they may have a larger portion of their money left over after sales taxes. For example, according to one 2009 study, a consumer who is willing to travel 10 miles in a vehicle to shop will generate $90 for the local community for every 100 miles they travel, including the total spent, any taxes paid, and other revenues like gratuities or spending on other goods or services. Taxes are a big factor in purchasing decisions, too, as people tend to prefer to spend their money locally if they can save money, or purchase items tax-free, such as"

The following session will explore how we can use a more sophisticated understanding of the complex dynamics of group learning environments to effectively facilitate collaborative learning.\nLearn all about the concept of collective intelligence, and see how various groups of different sizes and from diverse disciplines are using the tools and techniques to work together online to solve complex problems or achieve common goals.\nThis session will also look at how the use of collective intelligence has changed recently due to the increasing ease of access to online technologies, how these changes reflect some larger trends and patterns in society, and how recent changes have led to some challenges for traditional academic systems.\nIn order to achieve a high level of understanding, learning and development must include the learner's emotional responses as part of the process. This interactive session will explore different ways of using emotions as a resource in the classroom and in coaching or training situations, and as a part of our own personal learning.\nWe will look at ways of understanding the connection between emotion and personal learning and between emotion and the learning experience for others, as well as ways of exploring our own emotions and using them as a resource.\nThe learning process involves change, and effective learning encourages more change. Some of that change takes place with the help of a mentor, coach, supervisor, manager or leader. The roles and responsibilities of these various roles and the ways in which they work together will all be part of this session. We will discuss some of the more powerful coaching models, and explore some of the different approaches used to help people to learn.\nThis session will also look at different strategies and techniques for developing leadership, supporting learning, managing change,"

        "output": "Why do some people enjoy the sensation of being scared, such as by watching horror movies or going on roller coasters, while others avoid these experiences?\nThe brain area dubbed the periaqueductal gray, or PAG, lies at the base of the brain, just beneath the cerebral cortex. The PAG plays an important role in processing pain. But scientists, including Dr. Bruce McEwen of the Rockefeller University in New York, have found that the area is also sensitive to certain types of ‚Äúpleasurable‚Äù pain, specifically the uncomfortable sensation one gets when one is scared or startled.\nThe PAG also seems involved in ‚Äúanticipatory anxiety,‚Äù which, in humans, can be traced back to the very first stages in our development. Babies learn about their environment through a process called ‚Äúattachment.‚Äù As newborns, babies can‚Äôt escape a frightening situation, but if they feel loved and cared for, attachment behavior allows them to ‚Äúattach‚Äù themselves to a familiar face or to a loved one‚Äôs voice. A parent can help an infant feel secure if she responds appropriately to the baby‚Äôs cries or if she helps the child feel safe during a frightening experience.\n‚ÄúThe ability to have a bond with one‚Äôs mother, and also to be able to have confidence that one‚Äôs mother will keep the child safe, that helps shape not only the development of the child but the adult,‚Äù McEwen said.\nSo far, scientists have found that rodents respond in a similar manner to frightening experiences, even before they‚Äôre fully developed.\n‚ÄúIf we put a baby, a premature and incompletely developed baby, in a room alone for a brief period of time [‚Ä¶] the baby reacts significantly,‚Äù McEwen explained. ‚ÄúThe point I‚Äôm really interested in [is] this fear response that‚Äôs elicited in the premature or incompletely developed animal.‚Äù\nFear-related neurons in baby mice\nA number of studies have demonstrated that when baby mice are separated from their mothers, some of them show signs of anxious behavior, such as fearful responses or increased vocalization. These observations raise the question of how these animals become afraid.\nUsing a technique called electron microscopy, Rockefeller University neurobiologist Dr. Suzy Griffiths and collaborators examined the neuroanatomy of premature mice at four different stages of development, and found that the brain region known as the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, or VLPAG, seemed to change throughout those critical stages.\nThe researchers injected dye into the brains of premature mouse pups at eight, 12, 16 and 20 days of development. The pups are born earlier than humans and develop rapidly over the first few weeks of life. They showed that VLPAG density dropped during the early stages of development, but that density then went up again. Then, at 16 days of development, the animals‚Äô fear-related neurons started to migrate from the brainstem to the VLPAG area, suggesting that the neurons associated with the fear response were being reorganized. In fact, at 16 days of development, the density of these neurons was comparable to that of a fully developed mouse.\n‚ÄúThese animals were only 4 or 5 days out, so there was really rapid reorganization of these neurons in this critical period,‚Äù Griffiths said.\nThese neurons were reorganized, or remodeled, in adult mice too. Another set of the researchers injected dye into the VLPAG region of adult mice and found that these neurons were indeed changing.\n‚ÄúSome neurons increased in size, others showed a decrease in their size, and [an] expansion of the dendrites of individual cells, so there was a lot of active reorganization going on,‚Äù Griffiths explained.\nSince the mice showed similar changes as they aged, Griffiths found that the reorganization of fear-related neurons in the PAG region takes place gradually, throughout our lives.\nThe ability to learn\nThese findings help scientists understand why premature mice can feel lonely and insecure, and could also help us understand why humans are anxious, feel stressed or fearful.\n‚ÄúOne of the major questions that people have is, can the experiences that animals have during this period in development affect the way that they behave later in life?‚Äù Griffiths asked. ‚ÄúFor instance, can early maternal separation affect fear response, anxiety, perhaps even aggressive behavior [in] the adult?‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs"

Observing the behavior of other people in a social situation can provide clues about cultural Norms and expectations, which also include taboos (that are prohibited by culture) and standards (that are required to follow by culture). Taboos and standards relate to culture norms and expectations and influence behaviors of people. Culture norms vary from region to region, country to country, and culture to culture and therefore they influence the following: 1. Attitudes and opinions, 2. Language and communication skills, 3. Social interactions, 4. Rational thinking, and 5. Inter-personal relationships. This article focuses on only the two first factors listed above...\n...How can observing the behavior of other people in a social situation provide clues about cultural norms and expectations? Norms and expectations are part of every society and each culture has its own. People living in a society always expect others to comply with certain things. If they do not comply, they may be criticized or punished. Norms and expectations are very important in societies and cultures. For example, in Japan it is expected that women cover their mouth when they sneeze. So everyone does it, even if she or he isn‚Äôt Japanese. Observing behavior can lead to clues of cultural norms & expectations. It helps to understand these things in a society. It can also help us to understand how things work in a society. Norms & expectations are very important parts of a culture. They can be broken down into two categories. These are taboos and standards. Taboos are prohibited in a society. These are often thought of as inhuman practices such as human sacrifice. They are usually frowned upon and seen as being immoral and unjust. However, some taboos have been put into place for good reasons. For example, in some parts of Africa, cattle and other livestock must not be killed in times of famine. This is to keep the animals alive so they can help to feed more people in the times of need. In the past, human beings have been sold into slavery or have had an unlived child or a handicapped child killed and thrown...\n...ÔªøCulture is a society‚Äôs shared knowledge and language. Culture encompasses the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of an entire society. Culture influences how we think, act, and communicate. The main goal of anthropologists is to study human culture. Most anthropologists focus on a particular region. There are four major divisions of anthropology: sociocultural, archaeology, biological, and linguistic anthropology. These areas can be subdivided into many smaller specialties. Social anthropology has a historical emphasis, studying customs, taboos, traditions (especially religious traditions), and gender roles. Sociocultural anthropologists generally study small, contemporary, and non-industrialized societies. Their goal is to discover the connections between individual and group behavior. This allows anthropologists to develop a deeper understanding of human nature. Archaeologists study the cultural development of past societies by studying their material remains. Archaeologists seek evidence of prehistoric cultures, such as settlement patterns, funerary practices, and other material remains. Archaeologists specialize in particular geographic regions and/or historical periods. This allows them to develop a more focused understanding of the history of human civilization. Biological anthropologists study human physical and genetic variation. They focus on the interactions...\nHow Is Diversity a Cultural and Social Experience? Essay\n...How is diversity a cultural and social experience? The term diversity has several meanings according to various groups and organizations. According to wikipedia.org, diversity is the state of being diverse or varied. It is a term used to focus on or highlight the distinct differences amongst a group of people or individuals in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion and much more. One common example used to describe the diversity of the United States is the melting pot in which people of different races, cultures, languages and religions come together to create a new society in a new country. This is a common metaphor that describes the assimilation process of people of different cultures into a new society. The differences that people have within the United States are one of the things that makes it unique and diverse. On the other hand, diversity includes the differences of all types, including abilities, gender, race, ethnicity or religion. According to the United Nation's World Summit on Social Development, ‚Äú"

A student who is 68 years old is trying to decide whether to work another year or retire and spend the next year traveling. If he works another year, he will earn approximately what amount per hour ($/hr)? 2.50 4.33 5.00 6.66 9.00 Which of the following is an example of a rate? a. 12 students take 80 minutes to finish a puzzle. b. 20 loaves of bread sell for $18. c. An average computer can type 150 words per minute. d. 94% of Americans vote in elections.\nYou can use this format to provide your response. Each part of your answer should be in a separate section. It will be easier to understand your answer and grade this paper if each part is clearly defined. Be sure to explain your reasoning, so the grader can learn from what you have done. Name: _______________________________________________________\nProblem 1: What are the differences between volume and mass? Volume is the amount of space that an object takes up. Mass is the amount of stuff (material, weight, etc.) inside of an object. Problem 2: What are the differences between acceleration and velocity? Both acceleration and velocity are ways of measuring how fast an object is moving or changing directions. The difference between them is that acceleration has to do with how fast the speed of an object is increasing over time. Velocity only measures how fast the object is moving in a certain time and direction, but velocity does not show how much the speed is changing. Problem 3: What are the differences between displacement and distance? Displacement is a measure of how far an object has moved. Distance is a measure of how far something is from everything (usually in miles or kilometers). Problem 4: What are the differences between distance and rate of change? Distance is the amount of space that something has traveled across from one point to another. Rate of change has to do with how fast an object is changing from one condition to another (a rate of change of temperature changes every few seconds). The difference between them is that distance is a measure of final positions, while rate of change is a measure of final speed. Problem 5: What are the differences between mass and weight? Mass is the amount of matter (solid, liquid or gas) inside an object. Weight is the force of gravity that pulls on an object. Problem 6: What are the differences between average and mean? The average (AVG) is a number calculated by adding all of the numbers in a set and then dividing that number by how many numbers are being added. In other words, it is an average of the total (the sum of the numbers). Means are numbers that have been calculated based on a specific data set. For example, 1+2+2+2+2=8, divided by 5 gives the mean 1,6. Problem 7: How many times you blink in an average lifetime? It depends on the lifespan of the person. For example, a 100-year-old might blink roughly 30,000 times in their lifetime. A smaller blink rate would indicate a shorter life expectancy and vice versa. Problem 8: Why is the number of people who vote an important factor? The number of people who vote reflects the overall political interest of Americans. It can also demonstrate social cohesion and civic participation."

Ionization energy, nuclear stability and ionic charge all contribute to the energy and polarity of radiation which can be exploited in nuclear reactors such as in the PBR-II fast breeder reactor (1979) to split atoms in a nuclear fusion reaction. Here are the salient points you should know about this video: Radiation has both kinetic (electrons) and static (photons, neutrons, alpha particles) properties. The \"electrons\" make it ionizing (radiation that causes ionization/changes to atoms) and the \"photon\" make it electromagnetic radiation. The \"photon\" has a discrete energy and wavelength. The \"electron\" makes it have a directionality and can even change momentum (particle or wave property depending on situation/frame of reference). The \"photon\" in the electromagnetic spectrum comes in units called ergs and have a range of frequencies known as the spectrum. The \"electron\" in the spectrum comes in units called eV (electron volts) and have a range of energies (known as the ionization energy). The range of eV is measured in Joules and the range of frequencies is measured in a unit called the hertz (Hz), which is a common measure of radio frequency or audio signal. Both eV and Joules units of energy have the same unit origin (SI system of units) and are just different units of measurement. The \"kinetic electron\" has mass and a momentum/momentum change, and the \"photon\" does not have mass or momentum. The \"electron\" is a particle, the \"photon\" is a wave type of particle. The \"kinetic electron\" has a wave property in addition to the particle/particle-like property (depending on its phase) and the \"photon\" does not have a wave property. The \"electron\" has an angular momentum/momentum change (spin or angular moment/velocity of charge change) whereas the \"photon\" does not. Both \"electron\" and \"photon\" have a quantized property as does all other particles. The \"electron\" has 2 (or more depending on sub-shell) sub-shell/sub-orbitals, \"s-orbital\", \"p-orbital\" and the \"photon\" has no such sub-shell/sub-orbital property but may have a quantized (discrete energy) property. The \"electron\" is a particle that can only be \"bound\" (have energy greater than zero) when other particles bind to it in an atom/molecule. The \"photon\" is an absorption/emission particle that can be transmitted even when bound (which is how a laser works). The electromagnetic energy (kinetic electron and photon energies) from a radioactive"

To help you with this, there are some questions to guide you: - How many lightning strikes occur on Earth every day? - Is this figure higher or lower than some previous estimates? - How would you estimate the number of lightning strikes? - (If you are unable to give a number of lightning strikes per day, try to explain why you find this hard or your estimates are off.) - What are the potential risks and benefits associated with your research topic? Take into consideration the views of different stakeholders (eg: policy makers, experts, lay people, environmentalists). Your explanation does not need to be an exhaustive (long-winded) overview of scientific opinions on this matter. It can be fairly brief, as long as you can justify your views clearly. However, a good overview will include a summary of the most popular views on the matter, some of the major scientific arguments on this topic and some of the main benefits and risks associated with your research topic. Remember to provide references (links) or other evidence that supports your research topic. Note: Do not give your opinion until the end. Make sure you summarise your opinion in a sentence. There are a number of ways to present your opinion: - Start by agreeing with your audience and then disagree. - Give a summary of your audience‚Äôs position first, then your audience's position and then your own position. - Begin by highlighting the main advantages of your position then the main disadvantages. Or vice versa. Keep in mind that you might need to clarify what exactly your position on the research topic is. So, do not simply assume that your audience knows what your position is (without you saying it). If necessary, mention what your position is on this topic early on (eg: at the beginning of the paragraph)."

It‚Äôs okay to say, for example, that the rate in Germany is higher than the rate in Italy. You can do this because you know that the rate isn‚Äôt going to change over time as your reader moves from one country to the next.\nGermany has 121, so 676121 √∑ 60 = 1090\n676,004 √∑ 60 = 11,324 = 109 √ó 1,021\n11,324 √∑ 1021 = 11.24 in a minute. Now, imagine you got the answer and your reader noticed, as you did, that this doesn‚Äôt divide evenly into 60 seconds. Your reader would probably realize that the rate for a minute hasn‚Äôt been accurate, and would want to know if the rate for hours was accurate too. The same thing happens when you use the approximation of dividing by 60. If the rate for minutes only came out to 10.8 in a minute, readers would probably have the same reaction and ask, how would this rate work for a week, a month, or a year? It might seem obvious to you that the number is going to be larger for the longer intervals, but you should be able to explain your reasoning step-by-step. What‚Äôs happening here is that you‚Äôve made an assumption that the rate doesn‚Äôt change over time without an explanation for why this rate is constant regardless of the duration. If we assume that the rate for a minute is 676121 divided by 60, that would be:\n676,004 √∑ 60 √∑ 60 √ó 60 √ó 60\n1,09 √ó 1021 √∑ 1,000\n1,09 √ó 1,000,000 = 1.09 million messages are sent a day\nYou can use approximations like this to solve a problem if you‚Äôre given enough information, but you shouldn‚Äôt stop there unless you are able to explain your reasoning.\nTry to solve the following problem by using rational approximations and by explaining your reasoning!\nWhat is the approximation for 51739.721 in decimals?\nUse the number line and think of the following steps:\nWhat‚Äôs happening here is that your reader wants to know how to approximate a decimal number without knowing the exact decimal point.\nA rational approximation is an answer that‚Äôs written in one of the two forms you already know: the form of a fraction and the form of a decimal. A rational approximation requires two steps. Here‚Äôs what they look like:\nStep 1: Write the decimal number in the correct form.\nStep 2: Write an approximation with a larger denominator\nHere‚Äôs a hint for this problem. The number already looks like a fraction, so just look at those steps! Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôll do it for 51739.721:\nWrite 51739.721 in the fraction form.\nStep 1: 51739.721\nWrite an approximation of the fraction from step 1. If you‚Äôre not sure how to do this, here‚Äôs a hint: look at how fractions work and apply that step-by-step.\n51739.72 √∑ 1000\nStep 2: Use the denominator from step 2 in step 1, and use this new fraction.\n51739.7 √∑ 1000\nIf you want to use a decimal, you can do that too! You can think about rounding off the whole number in step 1. Then you can use the new number from step 3: 51,739.7 to make a new denominator and write it down. Just use\n51,739.7 in the place of 51739.7 in step 2. This will give you\n739.7 √∑ 100\nJust like a fraction, you have to make a larger denominator by multiplying or dividing by 10.\nThat gives you 74 as your answer.\nYou may be able to think about this problem and get the same answer as us without having to take all of these steps, but it‚Äôs important that you can explain how you got your answer.

        "output": "How many songs have been recorded throughout history? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step. The first few sentences of your explanation are the most crucial. There is usually nothing wrong with including one or two simple statistics at the beginning of your answer to grab your readers attention.\nFor example, it is okay to start your essay with a statement like, Many people believe that more and more music is being recorded and produced in the 21st century. You can also say how many CDs are sold in a year or something like that. But do not stop there. You should then move on to why you think this is the case and use evidence from your research to support your explanation.\nOnce you present your reason, move on to more details. The more evidence you have, the better, but presenting a strong argument with evidence that is reasonable and logical is more important than presenting a whole lot of details. Your explanation should flow naturally from the first paragraph to the last paragraph.\nHere are some examples:. Some evidence to support this claim includes:. You can add more evidence and reasons, but you should also try to bring your explanation to a close. When you are writing, always consider your audience.\nIt is possible that an English-language student will find this very hard, so try to find the right balance between words and grammar. Many students write too much, using complicated words and grammar, and they write too little, so they only have a few sentences.\nIt is okay to add a few details if they are relevant, but make sure that your explanation stays focused and only touches on the key elements of your argument. Always keep in mind the purpose of your essay. Are you trying to argue for or against something?\nAre you trying to persuade your audience to do something? This purpose should determine the way in which you write your essay. Try to choose the correct words that will help you achieve your purpose.\nUse words that will help you convince your reader of your point of view. Your writing should show an enthusiasm and confidence in your topic and purpose as well as show that you know what you are talking about.\nRemember, your point of view and purpose should be clearly presented. A good introduction should provide the details that your reader needs in order to understand what you are talking about.\nThere are a few points that should always be mentioned, and they are shown in the list below:. These are the main elements that should be mentioned in your introduction. Remember that the purpose of the introduction is to introduce all the important details of the following paragraphs. This might mean including extra information that is not particularly relevant to the topic, but is important for your argument. Here are some examples of introductions:. The purpose of the examples shown above is to provide the information needed for the rest of the essay.\nThe details might not be as relevant as in the above examples. Here is how you might write an introduction to an essay in which you are trying to persuade your audience of a point of view:. A good paragraph should include a few sentences that introduce the main point you are trying to make as well as one or two details, some evidence, and a conclusion.\nWhat are the main details you want to talk about? Which details should you present first? Try to list the main ideas. It is usually a good idea to present the key points first if you are trying to persuade your audience, and your evidence should follow. Try to link your paragraphs together. Do they make sense? Can they be read independently from one another?\nYour body paragraphs should be clearly linked, and your evidence and points should flow from one to the next. They should not be completely independent. This is also important when you are writing a longer essay, because each paragraph should help build your argument and help you achieve your purpose. What are the key points that you want to make in this paragraph? You should try to summarize the information in each paragraph, before moving on to the next.\nWhat are the key details that you want to include? Is there any evidence that could support your points? If you include evidence in the conclusion, make sure the information is included in other places as well. This is a good way to summarize and convince your reader of the validity of your points.\nWhat would a reasonable person conclude from your evidence? Does it make sense in conjunction with all your other points? What is the logical conclusion that your evidence leads to? Try to be clear and concise, and think about every sentence you write. Check for spelling and grammar mistakes and make sure the sentences are ordered correctly.\nA good paragraph should be easy to read and understand. If you have doubts about how to structure your paragraphs, try reading some essays, and think about how the writer has divided their content into readable sections.\nHere are some examples:"

        "output": "What if the Aztecs had successfully repelled the Spanish conquistadors? What would Mex-icos look like today, and how would the world be different? An ex-tended cut, now fully accessible to English-language readers, of the original award-winning bestseller Mexico 1421, and featuring a new foreword by the author, this is a brilliant work of imagina-tive history, which poses an intriguing set of what-if? What if the Aztecs were victorious in 1521? How might the world be d-if-ered? The author puts forward a wide-ranging and convincing speculation on the answer, as he imaginatively reconstructs the course of history over what might well have become almost two millen-nia of Aztec Empire domination.\nEver since the publication of Mexico 1421 in 1991 it has become a classic work of historical fiction and has been widely praised for bringing an important episode of history to life, as well as for the historical insights it provides. The book continues to fascinate readers, both general and academic, and has helped to make the Aztecs one of the worlds leading historical and archeological subjects.\nThe author offers an extended, rewritten, and updated version of Mexico 1421, adding a new foreword outlining his ideas on and methods of research and writing.\nThe Aztec Empire at its height stretched from the Pacific Northwest to the Gulf of Mexico and from the highlands of central Mexico to its southernmost frontier. After its defeat and conquest by Spanish expeditions in 1521, it was replaced by the Viceroyalty of New Spain, a territory under the direct control of the Crown of Castile, comprising the modern-day territories of Mexico and Central America. The former Aztecs became a minority in their own land, and the Nahuatl language and cultural practices were later pushed aside by the Spanish language and religion.\nIn Mexico 1421, the reader follows Hernando Cortz and his Spanish expedition to conquer the Aztec Empire. He does so by drawing on the latest research in Aztec history, archaeology, and ethnohistory, and bases his fictional account on historical events and actual speech of the Aztecs and Spaniards. But he goes further-he asks: What if Cortz and the Spanish expedition-followed by thousands of colonists-had been thwarted in this effort and, instead, the Aztecs had conquered the invaders? What if the Aztecs had won, and Mexico remained their colonial kingdom for almost two millenniums? In a series of narratives, the author shows what could well have been possible, and presents an astonishing picture of a world that would have been very different if history had played out differently.\nThe book is an entertaining and exciting account of a what-if scenario that is imagined with realism and integrity. It is a brilliant literary work that uses archaeology, history, and anthropology as its essential raw materials and presents a convincing, and at times compelling, vision of life in such a world.\nIntroduction: Aztecs and Spaniards\n1 In Search of the Aztecs\n2 The First Contact\n4 Building an Empire\n5 A Quest\n7 The Foothold\n8 The Spanish Reprise Their Advantage\n9 The Rage of Huitzilopochtli\n10 The Great Victory of Mexico 1421\n11 The Empire Unfolding\n12 A World of Conquerors\n13 A New Empire\n14 The New Conquerors\nMexico 1421 Revisited\nAppendix A: The Aztec Language Re-created\nAppendix B: Aztec Calendar\nAppendix C: Aztec Religion\nForeword to the 2008 Edition\nThis version of Mexico 1421 differs in format from the original 1991 version and has the following additional features:\nA new foreword outlining the authors views on his historical research and writing of the original book and discussing the ideas and the background information he has since added to the text.\nA substantial historical afterword outlining the changes and developments in Aztec and related archaeological studies since the writi\nMaps of Mexico 1421 and the Mexican Countryside today.\nAn expanded section on Aztec religion, including new information on the Aztecs relationship with the divine, worship, sacrifice, and the importance of death in Aztec cosmology.\nA larger section on the Aztecs calendar, including new information"

The disease was a bubonic plague, a disease spread by rat fleas. Its symptoms included rashes, sores and ulcers, fever, and gangrene. The Black Death was primarily a disease of young adults, who died as much from the stress and shock of sickness as from the physical effects of the disease itself, which were often lethal. There was also a high mortality rate among children. An estimated 75 million people died in Europe within a few years after the onset of this terrible disease that began in Asia with a rush of ships from a devastated southern China. It was a fearsome time, as the disease was spread through contaminated drinking water, soil, clothing, and even simple casual contact with infected persons. The Black Death had catastrophic effects on the social fabric of Europe. Families that had lived and worked together were broken up by deaths, resulting in poorer families being split up and forced to work in urban areas. The population of Europe and cities shifted, as some regions became depopulated from death and migration, and other places experienced population growth as people migrated or fled from infected areas. In the aftermath of this terrible calamity, public health took a...\nThe Black Death Research Paper\n... The Black Death was rampant throughout Europe in the 14th Century. The Black Death‚Äôs origins could have possibly happened around the Mongolian plains. This was the place where the black plague may have started as well as possibly the place where it ended. It is important to understand the Black Death because of the large effects on history. It was the deadliest pandemic to ever occur and was a turning point in history that changed the course of life forever. The Black Death is believed to have started in the Mongolian Plains around 1330. The epidemic was not recognized right away because it was thought to be a common illness that people could cure and come back from. This wasn‚Äôt the case, it was so horrific that the people who survived the plague were changed forever. The Black Death was very contagious, and when a person started showing symptoms their skin would turn a dark gray and the glands of the neck would puff up. Sores would also appear on the arms and legs. This was just before the symptoms became so bad that the patient would die from septic shock. Once the sores would start to appear people would look for help which led to them asking for money from nearby cities or villages. They would use this money to travel to the next closest town so that they could receive help. The money collected while traveling was used as a funding for charity and help the people...\n...ÔªøEssay #4: The Black Death in Europe The Black Death, which swept over Europe in the mid to late 1300‚Äôs is perhaps one of the most devastating pandemics in history. While most disease epidemics are considered local or regional affairs, the Black Death was a pandemic that crossed multiple national borders. It brought death to hundreds of millions of people, which caused the death toll to be so great that some historians believe it severely impacted the demographic landscape. This was most notable in the 14th century, an era when Europe was struggling economically, socially, and politically. It is likely that the Black Death accelerated the decline of the continent and played a major role in its transformation from a feudal society to a more mercantile and urban society. One might even argue that it was the factor that changed Europe from a medieval civilization to a modern civilization. The Black Death was most notable in 1348, but many epidemics swept Europe after this time. The pandemic would continue to affect Europe for many years before subsiding. But the first wave of the epidemic in 1348 resulted in the deaths of between 30 and 50 percent of Europe‚Äôs population. The Black Death impacted the population numbers and the demographic landscape of Europe, allowing the middle class to rise and more people to have access...\nBlack Death Research"

What if none of their classic songs ever became popular among fans or other musicians, or even among themselves, and they never became a phenomenon in terms of what they did and how they did it? What if none of this happened? To answer this question, let us first imagine all of it did. Imagine what it would be like for fans, for music lovers, to a world without the music of the Beatles. It would mean a world completely devoid of: A Hard Days Night; She Loves You; I Want to Hold Your Hand; Drive My Car; Nowhere Man; Please, Please Me; Twist and Shout; Yesterday; Strawberry Fields; Penny Lane; The Long and Winding Road; Get Back; I Saw Her Standing There; Blackbird; Come Together; Across the Universe; Let It Be; and so many more. Lets also imagine a world without the following: The Beatles Anthology; A Hard Days Night and Help!; Abbey Road; Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band; Live at the BBC; The Beatles; Greatest Hits; Past Masters; 1; 2; 3; and Let It Be. Imagine a world devoid of: Beatlemania, or any other kind of musicmania, for that matter. Imagine all the albums that would never been made. Imagine all the great musicians, song writers, singers, and producers, who would never been inspired by the music or the band. Imagine all the fans who would never have been influenced or inspired by this music, many of who would never have started playing music because of the Beatles. Imagine all those who would never have studied music history because of them, or who would never have started following their own bands or artists because of them. Imagine all the fans who would never have devoted their lives to these guys, or who would never have started to see them live or watching their music videos on YouTube. Imagine the countless websites that would never have been founded, either by the fan base or by fans in general, or by the Beatles themselves, who made many of them. Imagine the many books that would never have been written, or the music documentaries which never would have been made. Imagine all the websites like www.beatlesbible.com, www.beatlesblogger.com, www.beatlesnews.com, www.beatleroyster.co.uk, etc, or the many magazines, that would never have existed because of it. Imagine all the concerts and festivals which would never have been held, or music videos and films which would never have been produced, or special releases, like the box sets which would never have been made or sold. You would also have never had the following: all those great artists, writers, musicians, or actors whose careers would have never kicked off because of the band. Many great artists, writers or musicians, or even entire bands, may have never existed at all if the Beatles had never got into music, which would also mean there would never be anybody who would be inspired by them. Imagine what Paul McCartney of the Beatles would have never written if they had never existed: For example, Lennon wrote the lyrics for Imagine, Strawberry Fields and Hey Jude, but also wrote the score for a string orchestra and choir for Sgt. Peppers track Within You Without You, not to mention the classic songs from A Hard Days Night, Help!, and Magical Mystery Tour. Imagine all the great songs from which Paul could have never written or recorded, including the solo or Wings albums, which obviously would have also never existed had they never. Its also important to acknowledge that not only did they write, but also played on, many great songs from bands and artists which never would have made it or would have never been heard, if they had never existed, to say nothing about the inspiration they gave others. John Lennon, for example, would have never written the classic songs from which he gained popularity, such as the songs from Double Fantasy, or the solo efforts from which he also gained success, such as Imagine or Instant Karma. Imagine the following: Imagine a world without the following famous artists, either musicians or actors, whose entire careers would have never kicked off had the Beatles not existed: Imagine Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, or George Harrison could have never written so many great songs had never exist. Imagine they would never have got together to form a band. Imagine they would never have become so great"

In 1939 Germany invaded Poland and the Allies declared war on Germany. In 1940 Germany invaded France, Belgium and the Netherlands. By 1941 when Germany invaded the Soviet Union Germany had successfully created an enormous 43 mile long steel fence surrounding Auschwitz. In 1942 the Auschwitz death camp was created for the purpose of exterminating European Jews who were living inside Germany. By 1944 German forces had begun to retreat and were forced to withdraw in many places around Europe. American forces landed on the beaches in France in September of 1944. On March 25 th, 1945 Russian forces invaded Germany and started to liberate the camps and free the prisoners. Germany surrendered to the Allies on May 8, 1945. In the days after the war thousands of soldiers and civilians committed suicide or were murdered by fellow Nazi Soldiers. By 1948 World War II was over and there were many trials to be conducted for war criminals. Nazi war criminals were imprisoned or exempted if they surrendered and agreed to help in creating a just society in Germany and Europe. What if the Second World War had never occurred?

        "output": "What if the Maya civilization had never mysteriously collapsed? What if the world was able to capitalize on the Maya's scientific achievements and keep developing in the same way that brought us to the brink of 21st century technology? What would the Maya civilization have looked like...had it survived? HOW IT HAPPENED The collapse of the Maya civilization was a mystery that preoccupied scientists for several decades. Although they were able to narrow down the cause of the collapse to environmental over-stress, a lack of knowledge regarding environmental conditions and agriculture of the time made it impossible for them to identify the specific reasons for the collapse. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN Incredibly, the current archeological, biological and geological records show that the collapse of Maya civilization was preventable. Had the Maya developed scientifically and ecologically, they could have avoided the collapse of their society. Unfortunately, they never had the chance to see how science and technology could help preserve the environment. By studying history, we might be able to prevent catastrophes in the future. In Maya Astronomers, author and historian David H. Kelley provides a detailed account of history and gives us a glimpse of what our present-day society could look like had the surviving Maya scientists been able to continue developing their knowledge and wisdom. David H. Kelley is an archaeologist, historian, and science writer. He serves as Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Ancient Civilizations at California State University, Chico. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Berkeley, Kelley has led and participated in numerous archeological and historical excavations in the southeastern United States, Central America, and the Caribbean. He has authored over 150 articles concerning historical and anthropological subjects of the southeastern United States and Central America. Kelley is a Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science and a Fellow of the Society for American Archaeology. He served as Chairman of the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing from 2010 through 2012.

Kelley is a Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science and a Fellow of the Society for American Archaeology. He served as Chairman of the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing from 2010 through 2012. HOW IT HAPPENED Kelley tells us how a civilization that seemed to have an understanding of the environment could collapse with the environment. He explains that with this understanding, he was able to identify when the environmental collapse had begun and what could have been done to prevent it. He also explains how the ancient societies could have adapted. As it turned out, they could have adapted in many ways, including making use of new forms of agriculture and the cultivation of new plants that would have allowed them to survive the decline in the environment. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN Kelley explains the scientific breakthroughs that would have allowed the Maya to be more efficient in agriculture and to be capable of surviving environmental collapse. He also gives us some idea of how the Maya society could have adapted and developed, had humanity been able to learn from the mistakes of the past. He also tells us that humanity could have used the lessons of Maya civilization and other past civilizations to prevent the collapse of modern society. If humanity had the chance, we could use our newfound knowledge to better adapt to environmental change and continue to develop as a species. Kelley tells us how humanity can learn from mistakes of the past and stop collapsing civilizations.\nhttps://magrudy.com/book/what-if-the-maya-civilization-had-never-collapsed-what-if-history-had-played-out-slightly-differently-9781523200243/\nHow can we build our future on Earth?

Many people think that Italy would not have become what it is today and would still be a backward country without the influence of the Western world. Others think that the influence of the Western world is what has brought about many of Italy‚Äôs problems. But they can also point to many improvements that have come about as a result of the new Western influence. The following essay deals with the impact of Western civilization on Italy and the influence that America has had in Italy. It discusses the positive and negative effects it has had, and the future it holds for Italy. There is no doubt that, as with many other nations, modern Italy would have been impossible without Western influence. With the fall of the Roman Empire, Italy was cut off from its civilizing influence and for hundreds of years was left to its own devices. The country‚Äôs people, who once had such pride in their civilization, became dejected, and their towns and cities fell into ruin. As time passed, the people of Italy became more and more provincial and backward. With the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the country was conquered by a series of powerful nations that each tried to change Italy to suit their culture and civilization. The barbaric hordes of conquerors introduced their vices and seldom the good things they had brought with them.

A: Dynamic Programming works by solving more difficult problem with solutions to simpler one's. The main purpose of dynamic programming is to store and reuse information in the best way possible. We can generalize the above function by applying Dynamic Programming(DP). If the string 'AB' is in the alphabet, then we can use dynamic programming to solve the problem: Given, two strings, find the longest common subsequence. The subsequence that's. A dynamic programming solution can be implemented in either linear or quadratic time, depending on the number of sequences that can be derived from the original sequence of characters. The longest Common Subsequence problem is an. Recognize which algorithms fit into this category. You can use the following dynamic programming algorithm to solve this problem if dynamic programming is applicable to your problem. In what order should the numbers be chosen, such that the sum of the smallest two values is maximized? Write out a recurrence relation, then use. When you need to solve some really hard problem you want to be able use your head and thinking to do that. This article discusses the Dynamic Programming algorithm used in an efficient way. Dynamic programming is one of the most powerful algorithm design techniques, but it can be one of the most confusing. One such problem is the longest common subsequence problem, which asks given a string of letters and a string of letters of the same length, how do we find the longest common subsequence?. In other words, the best solution to the subproblem is also the best solution to the overall problem. It is also the first topic to be discussed in this Dynamic Programming section of NPTEL Course. ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Programming ‚Ä¢ Greedy Algorithm. A dynamic programming approach to algorithm creation is called the DP-algorithm. Problem #2 : You have a dictionary of data, consisting of a range of items. This algorithm will solve. However, if the problem data is dynamic, such that the subset may be the same every time while the solution is the same every time. There is a way to avoid it. It can be a challenge to solve problems by yourself; however, learning to solve linear programming problems will provide you with a skill to tackle countless other math and business challenges. It was introduced by Donald. 1,2,3,4,5,6. , the longest common subsequence of A and B is (1. This is the simplest form of dynamic programming where the solution of the subproblem is simply reused for the final solution. How to Solve a Dynamic Programming (DP) Problem with C++ in 1 minute - Duration: 1:21. The dynamic programming implementation of the longest common subsequence algorithm finds all the possible subsequences or all the possible combinations of the first and the second string. This includes. If you are new to the concept of Dynamic Programming and have no idea how it works, you might first like to read through our tutorial on this concept, so that you are more familiar with what we are going to be talking about. The dynamic programming algorithm is applied to the longest common substring problem, where a string consists of non-overlapping bytes. Dynamic programming, also known as recurrence relations, is a technique often used to solve problems more efficiently. Given two strings, how do you find the longest common subsequence (LCS)? The problem is typically solved using the brute force approach. This program helps the system understand the concept of dynamic programming using a recursive approach. A simple solution for the dynamic programming problem is to store information about each position in the table. However, if the problem data is dynamic, such that the subset may be the same every time while the solution is the same every time. This can lead to an NP solution (non deterministic), if the subproblems are solved using dynamic programming. Dynamic Programming is one of those techniques in which one needs to put a lot of effort to create the initial algorithm for the problem and then there is little to do. The longest common subsequence (also called the longest common string, or LCS) of two strings is the longest subsequence of the strings that both strings have in common. The first method is known as dynamic programming. The simplest solution would be to find the solution of some subproblems by iterating for each combination (within the given set). The problem is defined as. Given two strings , we try to find the longest common subsequence(length). Example #1: Longest Common Subsequence. How to Solve a Dynamic Programming (DP) Problem with C++ in 1 minute - Duration: 1:21. You may work in teams of two.

Apologize sincerely and without excuses, without blame or finger pointing. Your actions and apology represent your company, its employees and its values.\n3) Honesty and openness: If there is a true reason, like a major shipment delay or weather-related shutdown, then be straightforward and open with your customer.\nDon‚Äôt try to get out of the situation. It‚Äôs OK to be upfront and explain the situation, as long as you provide a reasonable resolution and answer questions.\n4) Sincere remorse: Apologies are meaningless if they are not sincere. People can spot insincere remorse from a mile away.\nIf you really mean it, then the heartfelt emotion in your voice and your words will come through.\n5) A solution: The last thing you want your apology to do is leave your customer feeling worse than before. By making it right and offering some form of compensation, you show you care.\n6) Timeliness: A timely apology is crucial to success. If the situation is genuine, then take ownership and solve it quickly.\nPeople are more likely to believe your apology and forgive you than if you leave them hanging and wondering if you care.\n7) Respectful tone: In many cultures, the word ‚Äúsorry‚Äù carries negative connotations.

If you need more guidance, here is a list of common examples of what to do ‚Äì and not do ‚Äì when apologizing:\nWhat to do: If possible, resolve the conflict immediately. Be sincere and avoid offering empty suggestions or excuses.\nWhat not to do: Blame someone else or make excuses (for example, ‚Äúit was the weather that caused our problem‚Äù).\nWhat to do: Provide specific facts, explain your actions and apologize sincerely.\nWhat not to do: Make accusations or criticize your customer. Maintain a professional tone.\nWhat to do: Be specific about the situation and your actions, and offer solutions (for example, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about that, but here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing to prevent it from happening again‚Äù).\nWhat not to do: Don‚Äôt make apologies for mistakes that can‚Äôt be corrected.

It should be kept in mind that all questions are provided to students and they will choose the correct answer according to their understanding. All students should be encouraged to practice answering a variety of questions. Test-takers who are new to an assessment will find it beneficial to answer only one or two questions for each section. Once they become more familiar with a section, they can practice answering more questions. 2. While taking the test, students should only be answering what is in front of them at the time. The answer key may list alternative answers, but those answers should be left alone and the student should not attempt to guess at what his or her answers may have been since it could affect his or her score.

        "output": "Structure a podcast script for an episode discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry.\nUse our Podcast template to help you to write the script. Podcast scripts can take on many different forms. This article takes the form of an episode script, which will help you tell a story by using an interview format and a guest speaker. The script is written from the perspective of a reporter who is interviewing a guest speaker about the topic of your podcast.\nIn the format described in this article, the journalist plays an important role. He asks the questions, organises the flow of the episode, and presents the story through their voice and tone. The guest speaker plays a different role. While the interview provides interesting information and some entertainment, the guest speaker provides the expert knowledge that the podcast is intended to present to the audience. While there is a range of opinions and viewpoints about the influence of streaming platforms on the industry, this episode discusses one approach. This article focuses on the ways streaming platforms have benefited the industry, rather than the ways streaming platforms have impacted musicians, music executives, and others in the industry.\nAvoid using the present perfect tense throughout your podcast script. For example, you might say: He should instead say: Be careful when using pronouns. This is an error in English grammar that we often make when we write. You can refer to the noun after the pronoun, or you can use a different pronoun entirely. The pronoun I might be appropriate if you are the speaker and you make up the content of the podcast or if the podcast is made up of your own words. The pronoun can be used alone and does not need to have an accompanying noun. In general, however, it is better to use the pronoun I rather than the pronoun my to refer to yourself. If you use the pronoun you, then the podcast is more likely to be seen as written by a journalist rather than as a presentation and discussion by a guest speaker. Therefore, you should use he or she instead of you when referring to guest speaker.\nRemember that you should always start sentences with capital letters. Remember, however that you should not start sentences with prepositions such as in, on, at or with. This can make your language sound formal, or it can make your language sound stilted and unnatural. Instead of starting sentences with prepositions try to start your sentences with an action verb (a verb that describes what someone is doing). This can help to avoid long and complicated sentences or sentences with multiple prepositions, which can make your language sound unnatural and formal. In this episode, you could change this sentence to:\nThe benefits of streaming platforms for artists have been obvious. While there are many benefits, one thing is clear: Artists can reach an international and global audience with streaming platforms. For the music industry, which operates on a global scale, streaming platforms have had a major impact. For individual artists, small businesses, and the industry as a whole, streaming platforms have opened up new possibilities to reach new audiences online.\nThe first guests are often the people with the most experience on the topic being discussed. It is usual, therefore, for guests to be well-known musicians, managers, artists, or other people working in the industry. These well-established professionals can share their first-hand knowledge and experiences of working in the industry with your audience who can benefit from their expertise. This episode, for example, might feature a guest speaker who has been a music manager and international recording and touring artist for many years. This person could provide historical knowledge about the music industry, which has helped to shape the business as we know it today, and provide insight around how streaming platforms have changed the industry for musicians.\nYou might make a guest list before you start writing your podcast script. This allows you to plan the interview and think about your questions before you begin. For this episode, you might decide to speak to four guest speakers to represent four different positions. These positions might be:\nA musician who has a large international following and a large online audience\nThe owner of a small music business in a small country\nA streaming platform executive from a large company\nAn artist and songwriter who has gained success after working independently\nThis list of guest speakers might represent different viewpoints and interests. You might decide, for example, to speak to someone who represents large companies in order to get a different perspective and point of view on the industry and the impact of streaming platforms than you would get from two independent artists. Or, you might decide to speak to two artists because you are interested in how different voices and opinions can create challenging artistic explorations. Whatever your podcast topic, however, you should aim to include diverse views in your podcast interviews. Diverse viewpoints"
