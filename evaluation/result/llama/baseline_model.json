We have more thoughts about the book we are reading, Leap Like a Frog, by Patricia Dunn, and the author has a lot of thoughts about something else entirely.\nAs you can imagine, we have a lot to share with you about this book.\nSeveral of you have shared thoughts with us via email and comments so far this week, and we'll continue to post them here. But, if you haven't left a comment yet and you have a thought, we hope you'll give it a try.\nThe quote we offer comes from the book's introduction (page xiii):\nFor this book I drew on my experiences as a woman of color in the business world, which is where much of my personal development took place. As I worked hard to succeed in my chosen profession, I was faced with racism, sexism and stereotypes of all kinds, a reality that I see far too often in our society overall, particularly here in the United States.\nThe author goes on to write about facing these challenges, and why they are relevant to all of us:\nI can see now that it was all necessary. Through facing and overcoming preconceived notions and misconceptions I have become stronger as a person, and more clear about what I wanted to do in life. I see now that my purpose was not forged in the crucible of those experiences, but by the strength and determination I found within myself to battle misconceptions and to stand up for what I believe in.\nYou know what they say about facing your fears - that they will dissipate soon after you overcome them, and that you will achieve power by doing so. We'll share more of the author's opinions in an upcoming post, but for now we'd like to get a start on the conversation you want to share.\nLabels: fear, Leap Like A Frog, Patricia Dunn, racism, stereotypes\nOn the eve of our nation's 232nd birthday, we thought we should share a few patriotic links (and links, too).\nYou'll find tons of great, patriotic songs from iTunes.\nYou can purchase a collection of great (and patriotic) quotations from Amazon.com.\nWe hope you are heading out to a wonderful celebration, too.

Place your fingers at the middle of the parcel, and then pull the gift wrap to tie or fold. The gift wrap should be taut, and smooth, without any wrinkles. Some people use ribbons to wrap the present. A ribbon is a strip of fabric. A bow is a piece of fabric that looks like a circle with two ends, called the tails. You can also use a rope or cord. Ribbons and bows are also decorations for Christmas trees. The decorative bows or ribbons come in different colors, and are also suitable to wrap presents. How do I decorate a Christmas tree? Here are some tips: 1. Cut the tree and the electric wire into the right sizes, and bend the ends so that the wires are not too short or too long. 2. Stick the electric wire into the right hole of the base. 3. Push the tree into the base tightly. 4. Cut the wire to the tree and the base. 5. Make a bow. 6. Cut the light wire to the right lenght. 7. Take off the plastic foil of the light. 8. Connect the light with the light sock, then hang the light on the tree. After you finish the decoration you can begin the Christmas celebration. A Christmas tree is one of the symbols of Christmas. Christmas is a holiday to celebrate the birth of Jesus. It is a festive celebration held on December 25th. Some people do not know that Christmas was made in the 3 rd century by a man named Charles of the Netherlands, who lived in France. Charles of the Netherlands made Christmas a religious festival. At first, Christians only decorated their churches. But then people started decorating their houses, too. Nowadays Christmas is a very important holiday in almost every country in the world. Christmas in America and Europe on December 25th but Christmas in England, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand on December 25th and Christmas in Canada and South Africa on December 25th. In the old history, the Christmas celebration was very simple. First of all, every family should hang up the Christmas tree, which has a very long history, and every family should have fireworks, decorations and other activities. In every family, the parents should give the children presents and send them to school. In Britain, many families hang mistletoe on the door knocker, windows or on the wall. In the past, people made Christmas trees from fir trees. They hanged them on the walls or hung them on the door knocker, and decorated them with various things. Then the parents in every families gave the children presents and sent them to school. In Germany, people made Christmas trees from the pine trees because they liked the pine trees. Then the parents decorated the trees with balls, candles, ornaments and other things. They also liked to give presents to the children and sent them to school. In Britain, people made Christmas trees out of fir trees. In Germany, people made Christmas trees out of the pine trees because they liked it. Christmas is a winter holiday. So we usually have a white Christmas. So the first snowfall is very beautiful at Christmas. At Christmas, people celebrate the birth of Jesus. So the most important activities are Christmas caroling, the Christmas feast, exchanging gifts between relatives and visitors, and visiting friends and relatives. Christmas is not only a feast to enjoy oneself but also a festival to decorate ones home and welcome friends. Christmas is a special fest to us, because we like the decorations, the foods, the presents and the parties with our families. We also like to receive presents from others without doing for them. So we do not have a feast in the kitchen, but an extraordinary feast in the living room with our families. It is also a family outing on Christmas Eve when we can visit our neighbors. Besides, we also have a party with visiting and our friends. Christmas is not only a feast to enjoy ourselfs but also a festival to decorate our homes and welcome friends and relatives. Christmas is a special fest for us because we enjoy the decorations, the foods, the presents and family parties. We also like to celebrate Christmas, to get presents from people around us, and to have fun with our families. To start with, in every family, the parents should give the children presents and send them to school. Secondly, in every family, each person gets their own presents, also the parents. Then Christmas caroling would come at the same time as Christmas Eve, and then we will"

I just wrote up an answer and clicked on send, and your message said \"The message you just wrote was delivered to the following recipients: Krista\"! OMG! That can't be! There's no way! I wrote my response before she replied!\nDidn't you say that I might want to work with someone to help us learn how to write more clearly? Well, I want to do!\nIf you're just getting started teaching yourself to write more legibly, then it's important to remember a few basic facts:\nFirst of all, good handwriting is the result of good technique and consistent practice. Although much writing is done with computers today, it is very important to keep up your handwriting skills so that you become proficient in the process. In fact, there are a number of benefits to keeping up your handwriting skills, which include:\nIt is a good way for me to relax my mind and body while I concentrate on my writing.\nIt gives me a sense of accomplishment.\nThere are certain times that handwriting is necessary, or better yet, more efficient than typing. As I will detail later, good handwriting may be even more important to those with a particular learning disability.\nPeople tend to read or edit handwriting much better than type.\nGood handwriting can be attractively formatted and decorated.\nIt provides you with a history of your ideas.\nSecond of all, good handwriting should be legible so that it is easy to read. As with anything else, it is helpful to use what some people call a “positive technique” in regard to your handwriting. What is a positive technique? Simply the practice of following these handwriting rules:\nBe consistent. Don't switch between different fonts, sizes and writing styles.\nAlways use a pen. Although pencil is okay too, don't try to add to your handwriting by using other drawing tools (like crayons and permanent markers) as this can only lead to trouble. Your best bet is to use a nice pen, preferably a ball point.\nAlways leave room to write more. When you are finished with one sentence, start another, but don’t let your pen run off the page. If a sentence needs more room, don’t try to fit it on by writing smaller; instead, use enough space at the beginning of another line of writing.\nUse your whole pen. The goal is to leave a complete “web” of ink. Remember your pen does have an ink reserve and is not running out.\nUse good letters and numbers. To be specific in this case, the letters “I”, “L”, “O”, “W”, and “T” are the problem letters. Be sure that they do not appear in your notes.\nPractice often. Don’t forget that this is a skill that you need to use often. So don’t forget that you must:\nPractice writing in your notebooks or journals.\nUse what you have learned on test papers when taking quizzes or tests in class.\nFinally, remember that you are your own best resource to improve your handwriting skills. Above all, find a way of doing it that is fun, interesting and motivational!\nI hope that my ideas have been helpful in some way. In the end, it’s always best to find something that you love, or at least something that you’re interested in learning, and then to do it! With all of the information on the Internet, you can teach yourself virtually anything! Best of luck to you!\nIn case it wasn't helpful enough, here's a better source of info. I found her book at an indie bookstore in DC, but she also has a great site and some other books to go with. Check her out!\nDear Dr. Wanda,\nI have recently found out that I have scoliosis in my right knee. I have already had my first surgery on that knee, and I am about to have my second one.

        "output": "I want to get better at networking at work and with other people. Maybe also spend less time on the computer. I want to continue my blog because it helps me stay in touch with friends and family and it’s helping me build my website. I want to go out more with friends. I don’t know where my life is going, but I feel like I’m on the right track and I may get where I want to be.\nWhat have you accomplished in your journey toward the ultimate goal?\nI’ve always got to start at the beginning. Since the beginning of the year, I’ve started reading 10 books. I’m also continuing my regular workouts and maintaining my diet, so I’m on track for 50 books and 365 workouts/120 hours of exercise. Maybe I’ll do some hiking this year, too. I also did some networking after 2 years of avoiding it, and I met a lot of people at my last company and at the conference I went to. I got some job offers and interviews, but no job offers. But I’m continuing the job search. I also started going out to dinner and movies with friends again. I went out with my parents to dinner.\nI don’t have a set goal, but I think I’ll end up staying here in San Francisco and working here for awhile.\nWhat have you realized so far at the beginning of 2015 that have helped you focus your efforts for the year?\nI don’t know if I’m really focused on anything right now. This year, I’ve been trying to give the most in a short amount of time. It’s my last chance before I’m 30, so I’m trying to get as much out of the rest of my 20s as I can.\nWhat are you really focusing most on for the year?\nI’m still focusing on the long-term things, and still trying to do a lot of new and fun things.\nWhat do you really want for the year?\nTo continue what I’m on.\nWhere do you see yourself in ten years?\nI would like to be in a relationship and married, still living in California. Probably owning and running a business of some sort – either programming or another kind of tech business or maybe starting a company that does something good.\nWhat do you need to do to improve your job skills in order to get there?\nJust keep going to school and reading.\nWhat are your professional and personal goals?\nPersonal: be healthy and strong, keep up with the health routine; exercise 3-4 hours a week. Keeping weight to around 220-225, which is the lowest it’s ever been for me and at 10% bodyfat.\nProfessional: Keep networking, get at least two interviews and get a job offer. Work at a good startup for 2yrs minimum, get some valuable technical experience, and also learn about running startups and startups.\nI also want to go back to school for a Master’s degree in Computer Science (or something similar) in 3-5 years.\nHave you achieved your “personal ideal” lifestyle so far?\nI’m doing well with my body, but I want to be able to build enough muscle without getting sick from the workouts. I used to be stronger when I was younger, but I stopped going to the gym when I got too sick from going so hard. That’s the only thing holding me back right now.\nIf not, what do you need to achieve that goal by this year?\nJust a stronger immune system and the right training for the gym. I’ll probably rejoin the gym next week after my birthday.\nWhat are some things you’re really excited to do in 2015?\nRead books and articles about startups, and keep up with startups. Also read more about computer security, encryption, computer science, and other programming-related things.\nWhat are some things you’re really looking forward to in 2015?\nI’m really looking forward to my last year of living in San Francisco. It’s the best time of my life so far. I definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone.\nWhat are some things you plan to accomplish in 2015?\nRead more books, work out more, exercise 3-4 hours a week, work at a good startup for at least 2yrs.\nI also want to go traveling more and see more of the world. I also want to learn how to play musical instruments and start getting better at drawing.\nWhat are some things"

The weird Christmas traditions that are brought up in this episode are: having a Christmas tree that is so tall it will make the Christmas lights go out; getting rid of the Christmas tree a day before New Year; having a family member make a homemade gift for everyone; and having a birthday party for the baby Jesus. All the weird Christmas traditions that people talk about are quite interesting to listen to, and it only makes me want to start a few new weird traditions for my family!\nA Christmas tradition I love is: having Christmas dinner with my family the night before. I really get into the Christmasy vibe by getting ready and going to our family dinner. This tradition includes: 1) Christmas carols; 2) a Christmas poem; 3) lots of food; and of course 4) presents!\nI also have a Christmas tradition that is a little strange: I always have a Christmas party at my house on the 24th of December with about 6 or 7 friends who don't celebrate Christmas every year, but always come to my house the day before. This tradition includes: 1) lots of food; and of course, 2) playing cardboard box soccer! (Hopefully this tradition won't end if I leave to go to university and don't come home, as many of these friends are in England).\nA Christmas tradition that probably won't last: our family tradition of hanging up a new pair of red underwear for each person every year (for Santa to see, heh!). I guess this tradition came about once my family started doing more Santa (and I hope to keep this tradition up!). Santa and santa gifts in my house!\nSay WHAAAT!? Do you have a cool tradition at your house? A weird tradition? Did you make a Christmas present this year? Did you get one? Tell me about it in a comment!\n-Christmas carols: The Chipmunk song, \"Sleigh Ride\", \"Frosty\" etc etc\n-Christmas poem: \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\" (not one of my favourites!)\n-Lots of food: a potato and bacon salad, lots of chocolates, a Christmas cake, a roast dinner, and other snacks!\n-Presents: Toy story, lots of CD's (including The Offspring, and The Chainsmokers!), a board game of Settlers, a book I've been wanting to read, and more!\nChristmasholidaytraditionweird\n← #124: The Dinner Guest\n#126: What Kind of Christmas Gift? →"

In this book you’ll learn about how cats are so very social, just like us!\nI've read a few of the Cat books which are very similar in content and layout and you can find many more in my reviews of that series. The book is very well presented and looks as good as the rest. It is packed with pictures although there is a decent amount of text too. I still think though that 19 pages of text and pictures is a lot for a beginner reader aged 7-9 years, but maybe not the worst book in the series. Like the others it is presented in a clear and simple way and makes for interesting and enjoyable reading...if only to see what's on the following page! But really the books have a good introduction and they take a simple approach, yet offer something a little more complex than the books of 5 years ago for beginner readers.\nA very enjoyable book with some lovely pictures to accompany the information and facts. There's plenty of pages to read too, which was great at bedtime. I'd rate this as a good book for the age group it's aimed at.\nLabels: Cat book, Cat Book Reviews, Cat books, Cat Review, Cat Reviews, Cat Stuff, Cats, Fun Kitty, Fun Stuff, Kitty, Reviews, Stuff for Cats"

        "output": "What are some artists I might like if I like Billy Joel? This question is actually quite tricky. The reason we’re asking it is because, Billy doesn’t really make many, if any, friends. He’s such an outlier and there’s been such a shift in music since he’s been around that finding someone to recommend is a challenge.\nThe best way to understand what Billy Joel is might be to think of him as a musician from a time when you didn’t really have to be a musician to make it. It was about having a really good voice, being good at playing music, being able to write a good song; and you had to do it all yourself.\nWhen you think about what Billy played on, there is no keyboard or programming involved. Billy and some guys played at each other and had good ideas. This isn’t saying that there weren’t talents that couldn’t really shine – there are, of course – but Billy didn’t seem interested in adding elements that he wouldn’t play a part in. The main thing to appreciate about Billy is his simplicity and humanness.\nSo who might you discover if you like Billy Joel?\nThere are a few artists that are most similar to Billy Joel based on their hit songs: Frank Sinatra, Harry Connick Jr., and Michael Bublé. Frank Sinatra was of the same generation and had a very similar voice to Billy Joel.\nThe biggest similarities are to Frank Sinatra, Harry Connick Jr., and Michael Bublé.\nLet’s discuss Frank Sinatra – he’s a similar artist:\nHe sounds like a much older voice – and he was over three decades older than Billy.\nFrank and Billy wrote love songs and love songs about themselves as women – very similar.\nThe voice for both is very powerful, they are both very talented musicians, they are both quite similar in the way they sing, a little bit of a growl to their voice. It makes for very powerful, beautiful, and melodic music. (Hear “New York State of Mind” for a good example.)\nA lot of Sinatra’s songs were written by Billy, which is cool.\nSimilar to Frank Sinatra, Michael Bublé has a nice, kind of raspy sound to his voice that gives him a unique sound and style. Here’s a cool article you might enjoy on Michael Buble.\nWhat about Harry Connick Jr.?\n“When Harry sang, he sang as a guy playing a piano. You could recognize the piano, but it was also an instrument that was capable of incredible subtleties and the most amazing sound in world – when Harry was doing it….” “….it sounds like he was singing from a grand organ instead of a piano. It would have an extraordinary sound because of the subtlety of the music of the instrument and that is why I thought about when Harry was singing ‘You Don’t Know Me’… it was almost like it had three voices… “ – Ray Charles.\nBilly and Ray are also similar in that they don’t really write songs with too much lyrics – they really just sing you a song.\n“The guy who got away…” When Harry sang, he sang as a guy playing a piano. You could recognize the piano, but it was also an instrument that was capable of incredible subtleties and the most amazing sound in world – when Harry was doing it….” “….it sounds like he was singing from a grand organ instead of a piano. It would have an extraordinary sound because of the subtlety of the music of the instrument and that is why I thought about when Harry was singing ‘You Don’t Know Me’… it was almost like it had three voices… “ – Ray Charles\n“Ray Charles’ ‘You Don’t Know Me,’ for instance—it’s like all of a sudden, there’s three singers in the room, and they’re singing from three different universes, and it’s just… I mean it’s a thrill!”\nHarry Connick Jr. is a jazz artist whose jazz roots in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz, are at the foundation of his music. But we’re not going to discuss his jazz albums because his jazz albums are generally not really liked. If you like Billy, his pop albums are a great place to go. He’s a piano, and more specifically, a jazz, player at heart though. He still plays solo songs on piano every night on tour.\nI hope this article was helpful. I tried to highlight what’s the same and different than Billy Joel to help you find some musicians you might like. If you want to dive in deeper, there is a lot more here."

        "instruction": "How do you become an author?",
        "output": "How do you become an author?\nMostly, you write a story or a bunch of stories that you think might be of interest to a whole lot of people. It is a very interesting industry and I don't mind living with uncertainty but at the same time, if one of my books do well, it is a great boost to me in terms of confidence. But every author dreams of writing a book that becomes a bestseller and really, really becomes a bestseller. A book which is an instant runaway hit. One of the first things I write in a new book is a dedication section, usually, somewhere after the prologue and usually I put it at the front because some of the people in the book will be dead, or in prison or won't appear again and I try to say, at the start of the book, who is in and who is out.\nSometimes I find it quite hilarious, the things people can get up to. I think I have always been quite interested in writing characters that say and do interesting things. I have a kind of natural attraction towards that. I like to write about the dark and the funny, I tend to mix the two. Because I always tend to read for the fun factor and I like to write for that as well. Every time, I finish a book, I am eager for the reader to say what do they think of it?\nI am keen to know how people react to my books. I had one of those moments where I wondered what I would do if the whole publishing scenario turned out to be a bit boring and a bit unsatisfying. It turned out not to be the case, I am still very excited about it. As much as I can, I leave the process of writing entirely to my subconscious mind. Because it is very easy, if I am a very good writer, if I think too much, it would affect the quality of the writing but it is the subconscious that guides the person that is writing.\nIf two guys are sitting and talking about what is going to happen in the book, then it is not likely that you would have an interesting book. There is a whole other level of reality that you have to reach to have these books that are so interesting and compelling. My books are also influenced by a kind of nostalgia, which they have and they are written in an attempt to recapture and enjoy. I like to create characters that I can have a relationship with. My favourite characters are usually the characters with something wrong with them, something disruptive or disconcerting about them but they are also the most interesting.\nWhen someone picks up a book and they see a photograph of the author, they don't relate that to you. They see the character that you have created and they identify with that. You would get a different reaction if they saw somebody that they could recognise in public, as you are in your photograph. My favourite writers are Raymond Chandler, Michael Connelly, Jeffrey Deaver, James Lee Burke. I am also fond of Agatha Christie, I have an interest in Edgar Allen Poe and my early reading was more to do with adventure stories, where the idea was always better than the execution.\nThe other thing is that good writing is a craft. You have to work hard to be a good writer. Some writers work quite well to make that clear separation between the two.\nWhen I am travelling and I am looking around, I have some time to myself, away from work and I always try my hardest to write down notes. There are lots of things that happen around us so you just need to be aware of them. Every morning, if I say, the sun has risen and the wind has died down, all the things around you can be used as plot points.

        "instruction": "What causes the northern lights?",
        "output": "What causes the northern lights? The Northern Lights are a natural phenomenon that can be caused by a varying number of different things. However, scientists have begun to understand the general cause behind this light show. This occurs when electric charged particles, mostly from the sun, are drawn towards the Earth by magnetic fields located at the north and south poles, and the atmosphere, producing lights of numerous different colors. What Is the Sun Made Up Of? The Sun is made up of hydrogen, 70%, which when compressed by heat turns into helium. Helium atoms, like hydrogen, are hydrogen nuclei, which contain less protons than helium, which in turn contains less than what is in normal helium. Heavier atoms result as pressure continues to build; most of this is turned into oxygen and silicon. Other heavier atoms become iron and nickel, but the pressure has to be higher. This is not always a perfect process, and heavy elements can end up all over the sun in varying levels, causing its color and shape. Scientists have a large amount of understanding of how the sun is made up (although not entirely), and have much more research to do on how our sun interacts with other solar systems. Why Is the Northern Lights Green? The northern lights are usually visible during the 10 to 15 minute periods, when the gases in the upper atmosphere collide and form the lights. The lights are made up of Oxygen and Nitrogen, which results in different colored lights, depending on where they go. When these gases collide, it produces a mixture of red, green, and yellow, which is the common make-up of the northern lights. In addition to oxygen and nitrogen, other molecules and atoms can also create various colors as well. What Causes the Aurora? Aurora are the flashes of moving light that occur in the sky when oxygen and nitrogen atoms collide. Since these two gases make up much of the atmosphere, it is the most common cause of aurora. In addition, there have been occasional reports of aurora from gases in space. The northern lights are most common in Norway, however this is not the cause of this aurora. As discussed previously, the aurora mainly appear in and around the magnetic poles, but can also move away from them for short periods of time. This is especially true for the northern lights, because they are most visible in the northern hemisphere. The Aurora: Facts, Discussion, and More Facts. The aurora is a color illumination which appears over both the northern and southern poles. It was first seen during a total solar eclipse by Galileo and was later used as a tool in order to determine our closest star, the sun. While many scientists still hold the notion that the aurora is created by the interaction of solar wind and atmospheric gases, others believe in more elaborate theories, such as planetary gravitational forces between Jupiter and Saturn, as well as the interaction of cosmic dust and plasma. A few years back NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) launched a mission which was designed with the purpose of figuring out the exact cause of the aurora. They planned to study three different parts of the aurora: -The aurora on the sun-polar-cap region -The aurora on the sun-limb region -The aurora near planetary magnetic-field region If you look at a photo of lightning (either from the top or side), you would notice that the light is actually an arrangement of waves, which move in a specific manner. Each wave is produced by the transfer of energy, from place to place. In the case of thunder waves, the source of energy is heat from the lightning. Most lightning occurs during the afternoon and evening hours, and is more a localized phenomenon than a widespread one. However during the winter months, the thunder waves are less likely to be seen because of the frozen cloud deposits, and the localized thunder waves are more active in colder regions than in the south (which is less likely to have lightning at all).\nIt is recommended that the average student, which has been exposed throughout their life with the basic concepts of mathematics, continues his/her studies with this discipline.

A vast variety of scenarios awaits you, from the Holy Land, to dark dungeons, from medieval marketplaces to fierce battles with the enemies of the Cross! The game is packed with dozens of characters to choose from, as well as more than 60 quests and 30 unique enemies! Implement the rules of the Knights, use powerful spells and take advantage of the tactical combat! Enrich your campaign with dozens of characters! 3rd Crusade The Archmage is based on the historical Third Crusade (1189-1204), a major religious event in medieval Europe. It has all the hallmarks of a successful turn-based strategy game: The Third Crusade is a unique blend of strategy and role playing that lets you fight the battles yourself, rather than just watching your characters kill each other. In 3rd Crusade your decisions determine the outcome of a campaign that brings together dozens of scenarios, such as the siege of Acre, the naval battle for Jaffa, the capture of Jerusalem and the storming of Damascus fortress, and the defense of Homs. With the help of modern technology such as the Crystal of Wisdom, players will be able to upgrade heroes and assign spells, as well as give orders and plan the battlefield themselves. These features combine to create a variety of different tactical solutions and an experience far richer and deeper than most computer games. 7th Son: Dagger Falls is a sequel to the award winning thriller, 7th Son by best-selling author, J.C. Hutchins. In the game, you are John Bradley, an FBI agent and the son of U.S. President Thomas Laughlin. As the game begins, President Laughlin has just been shot and you must make your way to Washington and stop the assassin who is working for a group known only as the Shadow Consortium. You will need to explore the Laughlin residence, learn your father's state through flashback, gather clues leading up to the assassination attempt, and try to capture the assassin. When you finally reach DC, you must decide whether to bring the assassin to justice or to turn him. It is all up to you! 7th Son: Dagger Falls takes the interactive fiction/point-and-click genre to the next level. The game uses photographic artwork, amazing voice acting from some very talented up-and-coming actors, and an interesting, non-linear storyline that mixes real-world events and technology. Even the inventory screen has been redesigned to keep you immersed in the experience.\nI would love to buy this but at $24 it's way too much for what I believe is an Indie game. Also, the graphics are not that great and it does not offer HD resolution options so I just would rather not spend more than $15 on a game that is not going to offer amazing graphics. I really would love to take the plunge but at this price point I definitely won't. If this was anywhere close to $10-15 I would definitely buy it. As it stands the price point is too high. I hope this makes it into Steam sales in the future though so I can pick it up then.\n15/08/11 20:53 , edited 15/08/11 20:53 by sgtx"

        "output": "How do I make escargot?\nMother Nature provides the earth with two types of plants: annual and perennial. Annual plants usually only last from one growing season. They will die if there are no frosts or freezes. Annuals range include garden favorites like impatien; cosmo red; black calendula - bachelor buttons; pink cosmo; lime cosmo; and many others. Cosmo red and calendula are especially popular due to the bright primary colorings that come back every year. The flowers often have double petals adding to the richness of the plant color. They come back every season due to the fact that they are perennials.\nCroco is one of two different types of crocuses. This particular variety has a much more compact and narrow appearance. Croco is a perfect choice for a garden where space is limited or for a smaller garden. It grows 5 to 6 inches tall with up to three flowers being held at the end of each stem. The flower has a trumpet shaped style that comes in a variety of colors including blue, white and pink. One large yellow crocus plant should produce up to 100 flowers.\nWinterberry Holly has deep red berries that stay on the plant from fall into winter. We carry a range of Winterberry Holly cultivars for a variety of garden designs. The berries can be left on the plant for attracting birds. Others choose to snip the berries off and then mix them with sugar for delicious recipes. Winterberry Holly is deciduous, so it will lose its leaves in the fall. The trees have beautiful purple leaves that change to a more golden color in the fall that will brighten up your yard.\nThis variety of snowdrop is part of the species known as 'pumila' which grows at about 6 inches. It was introduced to the United States in 1816 from England by Dr. Henry Philip Webb. They are considered to be one of the earliest blooming spring flowering bulbs. The greenish-white flowers are about 0.75 inches wide and are bell-shaped. They have three petals, the central being slightly larger than the outer one. They are produced in groups of two to six. The flowers can be found in the upper leaf axils or on leafless twigs. The outer petals of the flowers turn brown with age. S. pumila is a hardy bulbous plant. It is also called small snowdrop, or spring snowdrop."

        "output": "What exactly causes volcanoes to form?\nVOLCANOES ARE REGULARLY FORMING EVERYDAY!\nT-VOLCANO (24:38)\nA volcanic eruption is a volcanic event, occurring when a central part of the planet's crust (a volcano) ruptures and magma, ash, and gases are ejected. It creates hazards, such as a pyroclastic flow, which is a billowing cloud of ash and rocks that can engulf towns (or even spread across an entire country). Volcanic activity is a global phenomenon. Volcanoes, being typically associated with tectonics, are common only on Earth, and are less common on the Moon (only the Marius Hills have been confirmed to be volcanic in origin).\nT-VOLCANO (24:39) The most devastating current volcanic event on Earth is the continuing eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Vesuvius began forming in the late Pliocene 30,000 to 20,000 years ago, and is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian Volcanic Zone near Naples, Italy. During the late Pliocene, Vesuvius began a prolonged eruption that produced pyroclastic flows and the associated fall of volcanic ash. It eventually formed a summit caldera about 1.3 kilometres (0.81 miles) wide, which was about 700 metres (2,300 feet) deep. The caldera was filled by about 50 metres (164 feet) of pyroclastic material, which created an enormous natural shield-like structure with a diameter of 12 kilometres (7.5 miles). This pyroclastic ejecta later formed a tuff deposit over 100 metres (330 feet) thick, which underlies the modern city of Naples (then known as the Greek settlement of Neapolis).\nT-VOLCANO (24:43) The initial eruptions in a pyroclastic flow occur as fast as 100 kilometres per hour (62 miles per hour), much faster than any vehicle currently traveling on Earth's surface. These eruptions create large waves of hot air and gas (the pyroclastic flow itself) that can travel several kilometres per minute and can reach temperatures as high as 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 degrees Fahrenheit). This causes the ground beneath the flow to liquefy and spread outward, in the same manner by which oil spreads outward in the water if you spill it from a bottle.\nT-VOLCANO (25:22) The pyroclastic flow, once it hits the ground at the bottom of the volcano, is contained somewhat by the volcano. Usually, the flow will spread out horizontally as far as 8 kilometres (5 miles). However, at Mount Vesuvius, the pyroclastic flows spread up to 16 kilometres (10 miles) horizontally before they fall back through the air and hit the ground below. Mount Vesuvius is currently erupting again, as of 10.15.2012.\nT-VOLCANO (27:37) An example is Mount Pinatubo in Philippines in 1991. On June 15th 1991, a pyroclastic flow that was 5 kilometres (3 miles) wide and which travelled at a speed of about 600 kilometres per hour (370 miles per hour) ripped southwards into the town of Alangalang and reached Olongapo City by early June the following day. It killed people and animals, destroyed buildings, and carried about 2.2 million cubic metres of ash to within 30 kilometres (19 miles) of Manila, Philippines' capital city of over 2 million inhabitants. The city's international airport closed because ash was falling on nearby airplanes. Many residents of Manila left the capital because the volcanic haze from Pinatubo was so damaging to asthmatic and other lung patients.\nT-VOLCANO (27:50) The following year, in 1992, hundreds of millions of dollars were spent rebuilding Alangalang, Olongapo, and other towns and cities that had been directly affected by the pyroclastic"

Thank you hi. tony Hi, I am very new to cooking and I am making your tahini for the first time. I would like to know the difference between tahini and baharat and how much of the seasoning sauce do you add to the tahini when I make it. Thank you for your help Lori The first time you make tahini, you add tahini, bahaarat, and the seasonings. The second time, and in future times, you mix the tahini, bahaarat, and the seasoming sauce together into a salad dressing base. As far as the recipe for this sauce, you can add chiles or dried spices if you like…whatever piques your interest. Let us know if you have further questions. Thank you!!! Hi, I have tried 2 times (with about 1 month seperated) to make this Tahini. Now everytime I try, the Tahini “curdle”. After doing a little reading on your blog, I see you used the Cannon S. I am using the Breville and have not found a way to make this work. Is there anything more specific that I can try to keep the Tahini from curdling?? I have everything else perfect! Thanks! – Hi, tony I’m not sure – maybe try putting it in the mixer bowl at first, then turning the chute a bit to get the liquid mixed properly before putting it in the jar? I have only used my Breville (cannon S, the regular one not the immersion one), maybe the cannon S is too powerful? let me know if this works or not – tony. Thanks! The Tahini is “curdling” because you are either over-processing the tahini (a bit like whipping egg whites – the longer you beat it, the more it comes back, the less air will be in the finished Tahini) of your mixing time is too short. Both can lead to curdled Tahini. Just process it for a bit in the cannnon S. Let us know! Thanks!!!!! Hi, I love the Tahini recipe – I use it all the time. I wanted to let you know the the Breville S-Series has come out with a new 2 Jars Tahini. It is awesome – it really has a nice smooth creamy Tahini. I love it. Anyway it has Tahini and the Tahini Sauce and they actually work really well. Just wanted to share. Thanks again for all the great recipes. – Hi, tony That sounds really neat – I haven’t heard of that 2-jar tahini yet. Thanks for sharing, I’ll update my recipe, this time I’m going to use mine! Hi, Tanya, thanks for the recipe, it came out great! I made the mistake of letting it stand over night and it was solid as a rock. I just took it out of the fridge and put in the blender, it turned out just fine. Maybe I can leave it on the counter and blend it later… If I can, I’ll try this recipe tomorrow. Thanks! – Hi, tony Glad you liked it, that happens to me sometimes too. Let us know how it turns out! Thanks!!!!! Hi , Tahini is a great addition to cooking and healthy eating. You should try it! What type of cannellini beans do you recommend? I will get some soon! – Hi, tony I would buy the biggest container and beans they would sell you. Some cannellini would be a good bean to start with. I hope you try more. Thanks for liking this recipe! (Hiya, tony!) I just made the tahini sauce today with the B12 I bought from you last week, but I didn’t have the ingredients I needed to make the tahini, so I had to make do with some I bought at the ethnic store. Not as good. I will make the tahini soon. I have a cookbook from a long time ago called Food of Arabinia, the cookbook of the Arabic, Bahrian, and Persian people, very thick, with very few pictures and a lot of directions and recipes for a number of desserts and savoury dishes.

        "output": "Should I get my children a nanny? I'm so exhausted.\nI am so, so, so tired and I have so many thoughts and little time. I will start with the most urgent.\nSomebody asked me not too long ago, \"Do you think if I had a career I would be happier?\". I did not at the time answer her question, for various reasons, but I have been thinking about it ever since. I will get back to career questions, later in the post, as my own thinking evolves (as it has). But I want to start here, because to me this question has come to represent a great deal of what so many of us think about in trying to understand ourselves, our desires, and the world around us.\nAnd just as I thought it would, I have had to take a moment to figure out exactly where to go with that thought. I think one has to be incredibly humble to accept, let alone understand where a great many of our ideas come from. We certainly learn a great deal, and we should, but the unfortunate reality is that we pick things up from our culture and society as much by accident as otherwise. Of course this is not always the case, and we often conscientiously pick up a great deal of what we learn in our society's social and material cultures, but a certain amount of learning is inevitable. And we also learn as we interact with that culture. People who grow up in India are shaped by different beliefs about child-raising and women's place than people who grow up in the United States. And these may be informed by class, ethnicity, region, or a myriad of other factors that will color the way they will understand themselves and the world around them.\nThat said, we also learn what we want to learn. Most of us, no matter what our background, consciously or unconsciously have a vision and aspirations about who we want to be and who we want to help us get there. This includes, by the way, our aspirations about the people around us, and the world we find ourselves in. It was not particularly easy for me growing up, in various ways, and so I made certain decisions quite early that helped me to understand how my life would, from an early age, be guided. There are many things I have had to let out to achieve my aspirations, but having a vision has allowed me to get quite close on occasion. And one of my aspirations has long been for a life that involved a great deal of meaningful work and helping others, but also in my having the time and energy to invest in myself, my family, and the people I care about-even if it means saying no sometimes, in particular to work. I have a lot of other aspirations besides these, but these would be the two guiding principles for a life I want-and these are the things that in part define the choice to have a career outside my home.\nI have made other choices, to be sure. I could have chosen to be a care-giver to my own children from birth, or I could have chosen never to be a mother at all, or any of a myriad of other possible options. But these are decisions I made, consciously or unconsciously, even if I was only aware of the latter. They, and the vision they support, are central to who I understand myself to be and what I aspire to be and do.\nSo, back to the question. For me, there is a great deal embedded in that question. As is usual, as the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein would have noted, what we see as obvious and not questionable is not in fact that obvious or not questionable at all. There is, as an illustration of this point, the choice to be a mother, or to be the one primarily nurturing the children you have, on the one hand, or not to have children, or be the one primarily nurturing the children you have, on the other. These two choices are not mutually exclusive, although some find a great deal of meaning in the second one, as do I, but they are also not the only choices one makes. I am only one of a great many women who have made the latter decision-and all of us have made the former decision as well.\nI have made many choices involving how I spend my time. Some of those involve the work I do, and what it means to me. The last question I asked above about having a career or not, is in fact one we ask ourselves again and again, I think, as we try to find the right choices for ourselves, and others. But that choice is part of a set of choices about how we choose to live and what the world means for"

        "output": "When was Canada colonized? How do these factors affect the nature of the contemporary First Nations? When was Canada colonized? How do these factors affect the nature of the contemporary First Nations? This is question that has been posed and reposed numerous times throughout Canadian schools. The way in which people see the answer to this question greatly influences the position that they take regarding future relations with the First Nation. The way that history is taught within public schools (and within universities and colleges for that matter) is largely driven by the way that political elites desire to be positioned within an international context. Within Canada the education system has come under much fire from First Nation groups who feel that their history and culture is given the short shrift in the classroom. As such, one should be careful to distinguish between the nature of educational content and the underlying political and economic causes behind this education system. Within the Canadian colonial framework, First Nations were seen as backward. As such, they were positioned in a social context with which they were less able to cope. As the majority group that was dominant in the social power structure, it was up to the colonisers to define culture and knowledge. It was up to them to teach First Nation children to value European knowledge as a higher form of being. To the colonial elites, what it meant to survive in the physical world had little to do with the spiritual and cultural world as it was defined by First Nations people. As such, it became acceptable to take their land, to exploit their natural resources and to eradicate their spiritual and cultural world in order to achieve the success that they saw as desirable. The success that they aspired to was one in which they felt would allow them to be competitive in a global economic context. To the colonial mind, this would be achieved by the adoption of the education and industrial structure that was already in place within Canada. The educational system that was developed based upon this model was structured to produce the type of person that the European elites thought was desirable within the labour market. In other words, if the education system did not produce students who were more willing to engage in labour than other cultures and First Nations were not more willing to work more jobs then other cultures then that society was not worthy of being colonised. This was an ideological position (often hidden from view) that, by and large, has survived up until the present day. The nature of education in Canada has not significantly changed from this model. The difference between the way in which the social system is viewed through the lens of a postmodern paradigm of societal relations is that these groups do not necessarily regard the social (cultural) structure that is in place as being in need of change. To the postmodern group, change is not the problem. The problem lies in the fact that the First Nation social (cultural) group that was historically targeted is simply not able to participate within the economic structure of Canada. This is largely a result of factors such of economic (social - cultural) background, geography and the educational structure that was given to them within the colonial context. In the postmodern framework, this does not mean that First Nations peoples should be subject to a different set of educational and industrial standards or that their culture would be devalued within the context of Canadian society. It might mean that the economic forces within the society would be forced to take greater responsibility to allow those in the First Nations cultural group to participate in the economy or that the economic forces within the society would be forced to adapt to that fact. The postmodern group sees change in terms of how society functions. If the social groups that were targeted by the colonial elites were able to participate in the economy, then there would be no need for First Nations to be forced to end up in the same social (economic) groups as Europeans. If there were a need to force First Nations into different social and cultural positions then there would always be a need for First Nations children to be placed in a different social (cultural) groups from Europeans and Canadians. If the postmodern group was the driving force behind educational policies it would be seen that educational changes were necessary for the First Nation social groups to participate within the economy (e. The First Nations social group would not be forced to move away from their cultural practices as it is thought that a cultural group that does not adapt will eventually be unable to provide for itself. As such, culture may not be seen as valuable within itself but it would viewed as necessary for the survival of the social group as a whole. This is in stark contrast to the colonial mind that does not wish to see changes in the Canadian economic framework. As such, First Nation groups would not be able to participate with in the Canadian economy unless they gave up their cultural practices. As such, the postmodern educational view"

        "output": "How can I  use my phone less? I have done more than I have ever done to eliminate distraction. I have installed the NoFap app on my android phone. I have turned off all notifications. I have an old-school flip cellphone and when I use that to place a call, my distraction is gone. (This, for some strange reason, is very distracting. I have to keep opening my hand, and I get distracted thinking that I might open a flap, hit a wrong button, or perhaps open a completely different handset.) When I am using my laptop, I have a screen-sized distraction-free window to write. But I must use my phone to place orders, order pizzas, and to arrange for various activities. It's uncomfortable. Sometimes I just have to accept that I cannot avoid using my phone. I have to try.\nMy goal today is to create a phone distraction-free zone: _a phone time._ Time is a great distortion tool. What I mean is that if I am going to get some work done, then I need some time to spend working on the work. A phone time is created when I turn my phone off, or simply leave it in another room. If I go to do work in my office and decide, \"Today I'll clean the garage,\" then I can return to my phone distraction-free zone. (In my phone distraction-free zone, I can still be distracted by the doorbell.) If I go to do work in my phone distraction-free zone, and I decide, \"Today I need to make some calls and orders,\" then I can return to my office to pick up a pen. A phone time gives me a better grip on my distracting phone, and puts my time on my own terms.\nThere are four phone times I will initiate today:\nMorning – Phone time: One hour\nNoon – Phone time: Two hours\nEvening – Phone time: Two hours\nNight – Phone time: One hour\nThese phone times include the times I spend placing orders, contacting relatives, and checking in on my kids. The phone times don't have to be at predictable times of the day, although I find that helpful. These phone times are meant for me to decide when I am going to spend time in my phone distraction-free zone, and where I will initiate phone time (in or out of my phone distraction-free zone).\nMorning: I need phone time before I start work on the work.\nThe morning hours begin at 0600, when the phone rings. I answer, \"Hello, good morning.\" Then I ask, \"Can I help you with something?\"\nI often ask this question. I sometimes get a surprise, the caller asks for information, such as directions to somewhere, a lost item, etc. I love getting these phone calls. I love helping callers.\nOften, though, the call is the caller informing me that the milk will be ready at _X_ time today, and if I would like some, maybe I could come and pick it up there, at _Y_ location.\nThe morning phone time is spent placing orders, taking phone calls, and dealing with the unexpected. I make my calls and place my orders before I get to work. I am not able to do this all with the same phone number. The number I use for orders is the same as the number that parents give out to their children when they are on their way home from school, just in case they are in a phone distraction-free zone and need to call home.\nNoon: I need phone time when I am working on the work.\nNo phone. I try to make sure that work time is work time, and phone time is phone time. I like to work in my office, so that makes noon phone time easy. Of course, I may be dealing with other distractions, or perhaps have to do an errand, which means I have to be in another part of the house.\nEvening: I need phone time when I am tired and need a little break from the work.\nThis is my time to call relatives and friends who I seldom speak to, to check in with them. If I have a few moments of free time, I do some mindless online shopping, or I do some other mind-numbing task, such as check the mail, do a load of laundry, or simply take a walk (if I had already walked).\nNight: I need phone time when my children are awake and need my attention.\nThis is when my kid distractions take place. I don't like to spend phone time with the kids _after"

        "output": "Why do a lot of Scientists not believe in God or Satan?\nDuring this period the Church had made a concerted and ongoing effort to eliminate the last traces of pagan practice. The Inquisition had done it’s bidding and it was believed that the danger had finally abated.\nBut in 1891, a Jesuit scholar, E. Caspari, was commissioned by the Vatican to write a new catechism as well as the official ‘Ritual of Exorcism’, under which category, you can expect a rather terrifying set of rituals involving the recital of psalms, Latin bilingual phrases, various incantations and formulas of words, all of which are aimed at driving out ‘demons’ believed to be inhabiting a person being possessed.\nOf course, all this went out of the window when one simple test had to be made. It wasn’t hard.\nA scientist was brought in to participate in several exorcisms, in conjunction with priests in possession of the ‘Officium Exorcismorum’. They had all they required to drive out the evil spirits. They had the rituals and incantations – and above all, they had a man in complete possession of his senses. It was a simple test, to see if the Catholic Church would be able to remove something from a man, that, if he truly had nothing hidden inside his body, they would have had no problems removing it.\nThe result of this experiment was that, not only was nothing removed from the human being involved, but in fact, they actually drove demons into him! And worse, he was found in a state of complete mental disarray after exorcism.\nThe only question that arose from this incident, was whether the Catholic Church might have been wrong over the centuries to label everyone who they thought to be ‘possessed’ by evil spirits as mad?\nWhatever you make of exorcism, it certainly appears from these sources that the Catholic Church still have little or no concern in the matter. But what is happening? Why is the Church so obsessed with an obsolete ritual?\nIn the words of the ‘Manual of Demonology’:\n“The most frequent practice of demonic possession by far is thought to be what is known as “spirit possession”, a practice wherein some people believe that they are possessed by spirits which take over their bodies, allowing them to speak in languages of which they are unaware, uttering prophesies, and acting in wild and violent ways. This phenomenon is more common in certain cultures and nations than others.”\nIf the Vatican had taken the time to examine what was going on in the world, they might have realized what the Church was trying to fight against – with an obsolete ritual, which was not designed to combat the problems of today.\nDemon Possession is the process whereby the spirit of Satan, or it’s henchmen, take physical possession of a person, and cause them to act in an irrational, or ‘mad’ fashion (such as the poor man who was brought in for exorcism!). The most common type of demonic possession, thought to be what is known as “spirit possession”, is more prevalent in certain cultures than other – such as within tribal areas in Africa, or India and South East Asia. It’s also more common in other countries such as Brazil or Peru, as are similar phenomena within certain religions such as Santeria which originated in Cuba, or Vodun which originated within African cultures.\nBecause there has been so much information in the media, about demonic possession, the Vatican realized that there had to be something about this practice which had led us to this situation, so they investigated and discovered that this ritual is most commonly employed by two types of people. The first is the local people, who believe that they are doing the right thing (and no doubt get a lot of reward for their service to God or Satan).\nAs an example we will examine one of the more obvious examples of local belief in spirit possess, and the case of a boy, called ‘Peter’. He was brought to a priest by both his parents and nurses, on the suspicion that he was ‘possessed’ by evil spirits, or demons, which had caused him to become inattentive, incoherent and apparently disorientated.\nThe parents complained that their child was making odd noises, talking wildly and banging his head against the walls. His mother also told the priest that their son had been sleeping outdoors, without any clothing, at the back of their house.\nAt the exorc"

It was the best ship in the Japanese Navy. A battleship is hard to handle. It has big guns that must be aimed and fired. The guns are in a turret, like the guns on a tank. The turrets on Yamato were two stories high. A turret on a battleship could be anywhere from thirty-five to ninety feet tall.

These airplanes were built by Dr. Hugo Junkers in the summer of C These airplanes have three parts: the motor, wings, and the body. When a Zeppelin has crashed, it is a total loss because they were so expensive and they are hard to sell. The first airplane built was not designed to fly. It was also not designed for military use. Airplanes were designed for a military use. After World War One, the first airplanes were military airplanes, the first military airplanes.

        "output": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Danish dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Flæskesteg? And Smørrebrød.  Thanks.\nWow! Where do I start? Flæskesteg [a whole roast pork leg with stuffing] is only possible in a small family. My family was too large for that. [But] it is always delicious. This year, we decided it was time to do an open house again, and we wanted to cook a flæskesteg. It's really easy. It's simply a leg of pork, filled with a very special stuffing that you must follow. If you make it like we did, it's very good, because it's a pork leg. We boil it on Christmas Eve and we serve it the day after Christmas with crackling—but not the crackling from the legs itself, because the skin isn't very good—and there is the stuffing. You eat this all day long, and the crackling is delicious. [You can prepare a similar meal] by simply baking a slice of ham or a loin of pork, but then, you wouldn't have the crackling.\nBut to serve this meal, you have to serve a couple of other things. First of all, you absolutely need one of the best kinds of red wine for it. There is a red wine that comes from Nørreådal in southwest Jutland, named Riesling Nørreådal. It is a very particular wine. I find it's impossible to make a good flæskesteg that has only wine or only beer, but if you mix that with red wine, you will find that it gives it a special taste that you can't achieve just with beer. Because I have a friend who is a big wine drinker, he says, \"Nørreådal is a wine, because there is no beer in existence that can give that taste.\"\nAnd of course, you'll need some Danish cheese. I would recommend Danish Gammel Dansk, because it has that good smell and flavor that you can't get anywhere else. Of course, you can serve it with French or Danish Camembert. You can also serve some cheese called Oks (it's the Danish word for mushrooms), because it is an open, a bit dry cheese that has little specks of white [on it]. It's quite similar to the little white pieces of mushrooms, or a chanterelle, which you find in the Danish woods. The white specks on it are actually pieces of chanterelle—a little delicatessen on the cheese plate.\nAlso, the salad will be essential to go along with the Flæskesteg. In this case, the salad is very important. You have to have a Danish open sandwich—very simply, with a piece of butter and some Danish cheese on a good piece of Danish rye bread. That is essential—that's the smørrebrød [open [sandwiches]] we serve with the stuffed pork leg.\nYou can't eat pork leg if you don't eat salads. Even if you only eat salads and have nothing else, if the salads are good, you'll have a good meal. Of course, that will be a problem because you will just eat salad with crackling. So, you have to start by drinking a lot. Then, the whole pork is not that bad. [Laughs]\nYou might think that a whole pork leg is too much, but when you are with friends and family, I think [it is] better to eat two than to eat just one. You can only eat one whole pork leg, and that would ruin it for the following year. But you have to eat two and you'll be fine. The only problem is that sometimes, you can't eat two, because you are so full after the first. It's not that good; it's better to have some cheese and some wine.\nSometimes, it is better to cook things that don't take care of you too much. But I think a meal like what I described takes care of you for a very long time afterwards. And it is very special. It is like a family meal—a nice moment you can give your children. When you have all that in the house and you are going to serve a special meal, you usually serve a whole"

        "instruction": "Please tell me about the romantic relationship between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.",
        "output": "Please tell me about the romantic relationship between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. What was it like, and tell me a story about it.\nAncient Egypt was a society dominated by men. Women’s contributions were generally excluded from the official historical record. In the last hundred years or so, however, historians have begun to uncover details of Egyptian women’s daily lives. By examining their daily lives—at least as much as we can do so—we gain an understanding of both men’s and women’s roles in ancient Egyptian society.\nOne of the best ways to learn about the daily lives of women is through their works of art and their burial goods. The tomb of Senneferi, for example, reveals that Egyptian women played a major role in the creation of tombs for themselves and their families. This is one piece from Senneferi’s tomb, which shows her making offerings to the gods and showing the importance of the heart in Egyptian thought.\nOf course, the image of women in ancient Egyptian art is limited by the ancient Egyptians’ understanding of women’s physical features. By studying ancient Egyptian burial goods, we can learn more about the role gender played in the ancient society.\nSkeletons from ancient Egypt tend to be smaller than those of people living today (see this example). This suggests that many Egyptians lived under the threat of famine. The skeletal remains of Egyptian women and children at the time of Egypt’s collapse around 1075 to 1070 B.C.E. show that they had the physical appearance of “little old men, very undernourished, and bent double.” This suggests to some scholars that Egypt’s collapse was caused by a prolonged drought, which limited the availability of food and forced small physical frames onto all members of society.\nAnother way to learn about Egyptian women is through their work. Egyptian women did many things, even doing the same jobs as men. For example, in addition to many different jobs, men and women did different pieces of work. Work related to farming typically was done by men, whereas cleaning and cooking was a job women did. Although ancient Egyptian women worked outside of the home, they still focused primarily upon household work. This is one tomb painting showing a pharaoh’s daughter working outside the house in the royal gardens.\nAnother way Egyptian women worked was through the production of goods in their homes. One example of this is the production of linen and clothing. These people are spinning linen in their Egyptian home. This is a painting from a tomb in the Valley of the Kings showing work in the textile industry.\nThere were many different women’s professions in ancient Egypt. The women shown here are workers in an Egyptian silk factory in the third century B.C.E.\nIn many women’s families there was at least one boy to do the work. It was not surprising since most people did not live long and girls rarely survived beyond puberty. It is most likely that the “little old men” referred to earlier were the boys who came after her. By her age the boys would be doing the work since they were bigger than their sisters.\nAll women were expected to give birth. The most common form was that she would give birth to a son, but women also played an important role in bringing forth daughters, which were highly valuable in Egyptian society.\nIn addition to raising their children, the housework and production of goods, there were a variety of public jobs that Egyptian women could hold. Here is one tomb painting showing women who had been educated and who had jobs as scribes. They sit behind desks and write on papyrus sheets in the presence of a pharaoh.\nThese women could also study and become priests, priestesses, or temple servants. The men in charge of Egyptian temples typically taught their wives and daughters the religious knowledge that was vital to their work as priests. This is a drawing showing the goddess Mut from the Temple of Mut at the site of modern-day Karnak. In the New Kingdom, Egyptians held festivals in which they would carry the image of this goddess from the temple on the east bank of the Nile to that of her husband on the west bank.\nThere were also a limited number of political roles available to Egyptian women. They could be the queen’s chief overseer of women, called the “Great Wife,” or the head of the state’s female administrative officials, called the “Supervisor of Women.” This is a relief showing the “Supervisor of Women” (left), and the “Great Wife” (right).\nThere were many special women in Ancient Egypt."

        "output": "what are some good ways to spread ashes?\nSoil. Cremains plus soil of the loved one in a plot in the ground - or indoors in a pot in a small private garden, memorial or shrine. A family member can keep the ashes, or have it scattered in a spot of special meaning.\nDo all cemeteries require you to use a certain type of vault in their cemetery?\nSome municipalities require vaults. Vaults have nothing to do with protecting the caskets. They're for the purposes of aesthetics and water run off. It's really about the lawns and trees and keeping everything neat and tidy.\nHow do you clean a cemetery if it has a lot of debris?\nI have not cleaned a cemetery. I don't know how you clean a cemetery. Maybe you don't clean it - you clean around it - and then people can visit the graves.\nWhat do you do if there is a cemetery with nothing in it and no one is allowed to visit?\nIn such case, the cemetery could be an urban park or some other kind of public space. The community could dedicate a part of the park land for the benefit of any family member or interested person. The land could be used for visiting space. Some could use it for picnics - a family member plant a rose garden - the community could place a bench in the space dedicated - a memorial placed in the space. The community could hold a ceremony dedicating the space. If there are no family members or interested persons the community could put up a fence around the area and plant flowers. After, a community service activity - the community might then decide to change the area to an office complex - a community center - a homeless house - a park - etc.\nDoes the family hold on to the remains of the person or are they laid to rest in a casket?\nWhich state requires a grave marker over grave for everyone?\nYes. The Florida statute 497.16(1) requires that \"Except as provided in paragraph (5)(f) or (g), a body or partial remains thereof shall be interred within a cemetery under a durable memorial which is to remain at the interment site for perpetuity. In lieu of a durable memorial, the remains or a portion of the remains may be interred in a grave space designated by a monument.\" There is a specific section for cremated remains and cremated human remains.\nAre burials with full body cremations legal in all 50 US states?\nWhy do most people in the US place their ashes in a container at the burial site?\nWhen a loved one dies do you put flowers on the hearse in the funeral home at the service or do you put flowers on the casket once it is closed?\nIt is not uncommon for a relative or friend to place flowers on the casket before closing. I would do it if I knew I'd feel better just seeing them there.\nIs cremation a legal option in most states?\nWhat does it mean if you see a vault or marker that says 'buried at sea'?\nDoes the cemetery provide a vault for the burial?\nCemeteries provide vaults, coffins, caskets, and urns, but do not have them on display or in stock. Customers must purchase caskets, etc. to be in their inventory.\nDo you take the ashes home?\nIf they are burial ashes yes you take them home (it can be in a vase and you display it on a desk or bookcase, or just tuck it away). If they are cremation ashes, no - that is what the service is for - to have those released into the air (or the elements) or to be placed into an urn, and buried or kept in the family.\nWhat if you don't have a burial or cremation service?\nThen you bury or cremate them yourself. Burial is easier without the service, with or without the vault.\nHow long can you wait to bury the ashes?\nYou can keep them as long as you want. Some people wait 5 days, some wait 5 months, some wait 5 years, and some never bury or scatter the ashes.\nWhat happens if you don't want an urn?\nWhat does a burial space mean?\nA burial space is the land in which the human or animal's body has been inserted (either interred or cremated).\nWhat does a \"burial vault\" do?\nAs many other post"

        "output": "How did serial killers get away with murder for so long in the 70s and 80s? Didn't people know that a serial killer could not be all that hard to catch? When people today think that a serial killer could be one's neighbor, they're assuming that everyone in the 1970s and 80s and before was dumb enough to think a serial killer could be lurking anywhere in the world for anyone, a serial killer could be anyone, and that only 1 person could possibly be responsible for a whole string of murders. In reality, people just didn't know that much about serial killers and their methods of dispatching bodies. Back then, when a homicide happened or a murderer was on the loose, an investigator would have to actually go to the scene of the crime to see for himself or herself what sort of a mess had been made there. They would have to examine the area where the body or bodies had been found. They would have to take pictures and then they would have to send the pictures and any other pertinent information to homicide detectives in the city of the victim or victims they're trying to help. Since it was more cost effective for homicide detectives and for the police force in general to have all of their homicide detectives gather in their offices every morning to discuss their cases, cases that were already open, that was more cost effective for the police. By the time a crime scene got inspected, the crime scene would pretty much be wiped clean by the time the investigators got there. Someone who killed someone else 2 or 3 times in different parts of the world were never seen. As a matter of fact, they weren't seen by the police either, so nobody knew anything about them. So serial killers did have a free pass to kill and dispose of bodies as they liked because of the lack of modern technology. So in an era where technology was not what people have available today, people were able to perpetrate serial murders without getting caught. Today, people are caught a lot quicker. So if your wondering why you weren't informed about a serial killer by your parents or by your church when you were 10 or 12 years old, it's probably because nobody knew anything about them. The problem that's most people really faced in the 70s and 80s and before was the lack of the right technology to really help police catch and prosecute people suspected of serial killing. So the murders that happened then, people were not really informed about because they didn't have all the technology they have today. So if you're wondering why people were not informed about serial killers in the 70s and 80s and before, it's because they didn't have all of the technology available today.\nIn the early 1970s, Ted was living in Seattle, Washington. In the mid 1970s, Ted moved to Washington, which, since he already lived in Seattle, was Washington State. He was always living in Washington, Seattle, however, so it's not very uncommon. But Ted's real name was Theodore. While Ted only had one brother and one sister, I have only one brother and one sister. But Ted's real name was Theodore because his dad wanted to have a Theodore and so the Theodore was given to him as a middle name. And Ted grew up to hate his middle name so much he would not let anyone ever call him Theodore. He knew it wasn't a very common name but he didn't want to be called anything that even vaguely reminded him of that horrible sounding name of his. So he never revealed to anybody his middle name and he always put himself as being named Donald or James, neither of which he is. It's a nice middle name, however, and whoever gave it to him was probably a pretty well-meaning guy. Theodore is just one of those names that's a name you'd either hate or love.\nBut for a while, after moving to Pensacola, Florida, I actually lived next door to a guy who I was the only one in the whole town to have.

        "instruction": "How do I make apple juice?",
        "output": "How do I make apple juice?\nAnswer: One pound of green apples will produce one quart of very palatable apple juice and will freeze to take on the character of a good apple jelly. All that is necessary is to have the good apples for that purpose, cut into small pieces, and place them in a glass jar. Put an inverted, round, flat, tin cover on it and let it stand some months. Take it out and put on a rubber plate. With a rubber funnel pour the juice directly into a bottle and cork it; then it is fit for use. Two pounds of green apples will make three quarts of applesauce. An old, rotten apple will spoil if placed in a cold cellar with the good apples, unless it is changed frequently. I keep a row of apples on a bench. The first row is for the pigs; the second is the cider, and the third row is the new apples. If old apples are put away with the cider, the apples will be spoiled in a short time. When a green apple is to be cured, just cut off from the sunny side all decayed leaves with the decayed spots from the outside of the apple. Place the apples in a cold place with plenty of ventilation or hang them in a warm and damp room. As the decayed parts ripen, cut them loose. When the apple is entirely sound in the center, with the decayed parts cured, it will be ready to put in cold storage with no more cure or cleaning.\nMUSSEL MUSSELS are very good, especially with vinegar and butter. I use them as an oyster-substitute. In the spring and fall I find very large and fine mussels on the rocks. Sell them for 5 cents a dozen if picked out by the dozens. I find large scallop shells on the rocks, and often pick a number of small and very tasty oysters. I am told that this is the time for the best black perch. To catch them put out a very large hook with a light lead-line with two long, strong hooks and cast into the shallop; let them sink, take out a cast, and wind in again. I have had much success catching small speckled trout with a cast that had three-inch nails on the hooks and about 5 or 6 feet of the strongest, largest, and thickest silk line that I could find. On a sunny morning I am surprised at the number of small fish that are taken.\nMIXED FRUITS I mix all the fruit in the same cellar without any difference. They ripen at the same time, and if each kind is properly kept and looked after, they will make an honest living for the owner of the cellar. It will cost about $40 to build and furnish a cold cellar to hold 150 dozen of the best fruit, one-half of which can be used for maturing sweet crab-apples without spoiling. It is quite easy to make money in fruit-growing by attention to the cellar and in keeping the fruit separate from the bad.\nMULLEIN is very common in many parts, growing near the rocky hills and in the woods by the side of the roads. It has beautiful flowers, very easy to cultivate, and is soon covered with large, sweet, thick seed-heads. This is a very important and profitable weed, and a large quantity could soon be got. To cultivate, sow any good soil and cultivate for a week or ten days. Put it out, and cultivate and fertilize once a week or ten days. After a few days, sprinkle salt and lime over the soil. Let it grow a few days, and then spade it up, fertilize again, and sow seed. The seed is very free-flowing and comes easily. It takes about a year to get the first seed and to have a good head. In ten years, one can grow rich, with a little attention and good fertilizer and watering. Many a farmer washes with his mullein. I have seen him wash with it and put his pantaloons in his straw bed to keep them warm and fresh in the morning; and he was as rich as a king. Everyone knows that the stalk of the mullein, burned, makes an excellent hair-dye. I have seen an old man with a full head of white hair, and he was perfectly black with the mullein.

        "output": "How can I make bubble solution? (you can't buy or make it because it's a secret ingredient) It's a common mistake to think that you can just add your bubble solution straight to the water. But that's not the case, not at all. Instead, you need to make a bubble solution, and it's the liquid that you add that makes it work. It's a chemical mixture that you can buy, if you are smart about where you buy your ingredients. It's called citric acid. This is the chemical that makes the solution work! Citric Acid Is The Secret Here's What Happens. When you add this chemical to your water, it bubbles up a little bit. And when it does that, it's bubbling because it heats the water up. When the water gets heated to around 134 degrees, the water can hold more gas within it. So it gets kind of fizzy because more gas is dissolved in the water, right? So to summarize, the water must be heated. More specifically, it must be heated up to around ° C, at which point more gas can dissolve in it, and it will work. So we know where the hot water comes from, but where does the chemical citric acid come from? The Secret Ingredient For bubble solution: Citric Acid Bubble Solution Recipe (For 1 Liter Bubble Solution) 10 grams citric acid 8 oz water Combine 10 grams citric acid in a separate beverage bottle or drink container. Add the citric acid to a spray bottle or sprinkler full of about 8 oz of water. In a different beverage bottle or water container, combine 1 cup water and 3 oz borax. Spray or sprinkle this solution all over the lawn. Or Use An Electric Mixer If You Don't Want To Add The Citric Acid With Your Hands! If You Prefer To Use Something Else Then An Electric Mixer. Add 30 grams of Borax powder to the lawn or grass. Turn on the mixer on the mixer (mix) for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Turn off the mixer. Spray or sprinkle the lawn with your home made bubble lawn solution. And that's it! Bubble Solution Done! You Are Now Ready For The Killer Bubble Science Experiments! Bubbles Science Experiments 1 Bubbles, Chemistry And Sounds ! Science Fact: Noise is made by turbulence, meaning the movement of a gas produces sound waves. Science Fact: When a lot of gas is produced in a small space, the movement becomes very energetic and fast, causing very loud noise. Sound travels through air in little waves called \"sound waves.\" A \"sound wave\" is really just a fancy way to say 'vibration'. When you vibrate an electric guitar in your hand, you make a sound ! A bubble is nothing more than a big balloon ! When the bubble starts to fizzle, it's really just an ice-cube. When it sizzles, it's actually burning up! What About That Noise?! When a lot of gas is produced in a small space, the movement becomes very energetic and fast, causing very loud noises! You can easily hear this by just putting a glass over a sink and dropping some soap into it. (DON'T!) Bubbles are actually really loud because there's so much air pressure on them. To make the really loud \"piercing\" squeal you hear, just grip the bubble very tightly! 6. When you put a bubble on your hand then try to peel it off, you actually can't! That's like trying to peel a banana with your hands. 8. When a bubble is about to break, the air inside it gets really, really hot. It's as if it burned itself to death! 7. When a bubble breaks because the air is too hot, it fizzles up just like a small ice-cube. 4. A bubble is actually nothing more than a big balloon! The air inside helps keep the shape of the bubble. When a bubble blows outside this air cushion, all the air goes to the surface and the bubble becomes flat. 5. When it sizzles, it's actually burning up! The air inside the bubble starts to burn because it's so hot. We call this \"burning off\". 3. Bubbles Science Experiments Bub"

Is it just a matter of pulling it off? thanks.\nSorry for the delayed response–it went into spam folder?\nCleaning a broken showerhead–well, it’s not exactly a simple fix. It is possible to remove most broken showerheads, and if you replace it with a new showerhead, I’ll be happy to teach you how to install a new shower in the next week or so.\nIf you want to leave the broken showerhead in place, all I can do is point you to the directions found at the end of my post. In a word, you need a “de-silverization kit” which you can easily buy online if you do a very quick search before you ask me any question about a broken showerhead.\nI know these instructions have worked for others, but it would be more fun if they had to tell you what they did after the fact and not the day before.\nI have a Moen A7010601. This valve does not have a shutoff handle (it looks like on of yours,) but there is a button with a circle for on and off. The problem is if I turn the handle to off while hot water on pressurize the water comes out full force. If I let off the handle the knob that turn the handle back on stays and turns on full force. If I turn the handle to on it stays on but the pressure then drops down. Any suggestions on how to fix this ( I’m not mechanically inclined).\nIf the shutoff valve were plastic, then you need to call the manufacturer of the Moen or the plumber who installs this valve (often the same) and see if he is willing to send you the parts needed to repair it, or buy it for you if you are not comfortable to repair your own plumbing system. At $43, that’s a great value if fixing it yourself.\nI don’t know a Moen valve–I’ve never heard of it, in fact. I did look at moen.com for an A7010601, but couldn’t find anything. I’m sure the company knows you are there, though.\nAnd if the shutoff can turn on by itself, then you have a really crappy, cheaply made valve that really needs to be replaced, which would be cheaper than fixing it, unless you are the master at plumbing and your labor rate (or the plumber’s) is really low. In which case, you should call Moen or the plumbing company who installed your valve and see if they’ll sell you the whole valve for like $25.\nI recommend the valve to others, but only when I find out what it is first, and find a better one.\nSo where would this valve be located?\nWell I have a moen, valve, that is not shutting off like it should. When turning on, if you turn it fully off, it turns full on again. And in the middle of filling one of the baths it will turn on fully full on, it’s quite a shock. I was hoping to do something like a 3 way on the shower head to fix this but I’ll need some advice! Thanks so much!\nHi there, could you please tell me how do i switch the water supply on and off with my moen valve. Also it is leaking really badly now.\nCan someone tell me why when I put the hot water on in the bath my showerhead just stays on for like ten minutes, then it turns off but then it turns on again? And I was wondering why there is no way to turn the water off and on without having to switch all the way around or turn all of them on or off at the same time?\nHi, I don’t know why–it’s not normal. You may want to call the manufacturer (Moen) and ask them what kind of part numbers you might see on the valve, or if the product ID is 10600 or 10601. If in the UK and it’s this part, I would write them for a replacement part.\nHow do I dethaw out an anti-scald valve? Or a way to test it? Does not dethaw when heat is off. I have also cleaned it many many times.\nSorry about that typo. I mean the hot water is not heating the water.\nI have a moen a701062127 it is so"

        "output": "How do I know if my house has a water leak?\nWhat size is the water main?\nB. What size is the water main coming into the house?\nC. Is the water supply from public supply or private well?\nIf you answer B, C, and D to the above two questions (See Water Utility Page #2) you most likely have a leak somewhere in the house, even though your water meter indicates a negative balance. You will still have to shut off the water to verify the presence of a leak. The reason is due to the time it will take to drain water from the house to the water meter.\nFor the purposes of the discussion on the next section on leak detection, we will assume that your water supply comes from a private well or a city or public water supply.\nThe most important tool to obtaining complete leak detection is a leak test kit. These kits are available from various vendors such as Lee Industrial, Water Technology, and T.A.C. Plumbing Supply.\nLeaf Boots: The pipe leak detector, or “boots” are placed over the suspected leaks or valves, to be verified.\nHydro Tester: If you use this tool you must be careful and make sure you know where and/or what type of pipe you are working on.\nWater meter: Use this tool every time you stop to read your water meter. If something does not look right, or an abnormal condition is observed with a visual inspection of the area, it is probably a leak!\nWater service lateral: This tool is used to check for leaks in the lateral line.\nThere are some important tips when leak testing.\nStart the meter and note the meter reading. If you need to stop and read it several times to confirm your read, it can throw the test off the first time you stop to test the suspect leak.\nIf you think you have a leak, start the meter. When it does not change or when you are unsure of the reading, turn off the valve on the suspected leak and read the meter. Then, turn the valve back on, start the meter, and note the meter reading. The meter read should be less than it was when the valve was off, and hopefully, the meter should again not have changed or not change much more. If it does change, then you definitely have a leak! Note the date and time that the suspected leak was discovered. You will want to go back during normal usage to again shut the valve off, and confirm your read.\nIf you have a water utility, check your usage and determine if the water you are using matches what you think you are using. Also, check the temperature of your water. If your water feels colder than normally expected, but not a real low temperature, you might have a leak! If your water supply is from a private well, check the pressure meter. Is it higher than usual? If the answer is yes, you might have a leak!\nWhat are the symptoms of a possible leak?\nA. If your water comes from a private well, you might notice an abnormally high reading on the well pump (see Water Booster Pumps), or unusually cold water. This may occur if there has been unusually high demand for water (heating or cooling systems). Usually, your house will go on a well-water system backup. This is the main benefit of using a back up.\nAs water flows through the water heater and passes into the storage tank, it will expand as it warms up, but will then contract back down as heat and the water temperature drops. This is especially true for the cold water lines to the water heater itself. The same holds true for the tank and all of the water it holds. If the cold water entering the tank or water heater drops below 40-45 degrees (F) (sometimes below zero (F) in North Dakota, where we have very cold winters), the tank and pipes, that have not been heat isolated from this frost, will contract as they get cold. This will open up any gaps between tight fittings.\nClosing the valve or opening the cold water faucet can help. Turning off the hot water supply will not make any difference. Running the hot water usually lowers the temperature enough in the tank and pipes that ice does not accumulate. If it does ice up, the freeze will usually crack the tank and shut of all of your hot water pressure. If it appears to be cold on the top of the tank, there could be frost, water leaking, or other issues. Check the water temperature and watch the water level over time. When it rises, your storage tank is leaking.\nIf your house is located near a"

        "output": "What do the different octane values of gasoline mean? Some people think that if you top off your tank with premium or super premium gas, the engine will get 2 mpg more per gallon. But is that really the case? Octane is a measure of gasoline ignition quality. The octane rating, or pump octane rating, in the United States is based on the amount of gas required to ignite spark plugs on a motor driven engine. A gasoline’s inherent ability to ignite is called its antiknock (AK) rating. The higher the antiknock rating, the higher the fuel’s octane rating. This means the higher the antiknock rating, the more resistance there is to preignition (spark knock) that might result from premium or super premium gasoline being used in a vehicle equipped with standard-octane gasoline. Antiknock Ratings Antiknock (AK) ratings in America are based on cylinder pressure. The higher the pressure, the greater the antiknock rating. The test is carried out on a specially built engine under carefully controlled conditions. An accelerometer on the flywheel measures the pressure in the cylinders during the compression stroke. Because the compression takes place more or less instantly, preignition would most likely be a major problem. The test determines the highest pressure that can be safely sustained. The antiknock number, or AK number, is based on the average of two consecutive readings. The AK number is based on pounds per square inch, at which a motor delivers its rated horsepower per one cubic inch displacement and uses three octane numbers, expressed in decimals, after the number for rating. E.g., a gasoline rated for 100 hp per cubic inch at 4000 rpm and 4.0 AK numbers would appear as 1004.3. The rating indicates that this gasoline can be used in a motor requiring a gasoline with 100 hp per inch, at 4000 rpm, and an antiknock number of 4.3. The 3 on the right signifies that the rating is for a 4.0 gasoline; if the rating had been for a 4.5 gasoline, this number would have been 0.3. The rating does not indicate that this motor is a straight-six, or any other particular type. The rating may apply to any of the following engines, in any number of combinations: 4-, 6-, or 8-cylinder, V-8, straight-6, or other engine configurations. In addition, if the rating were 1003.0, it indicates 3.0, AK number. The AK numbers do not signify different octane ratings; they are a means of determining the gasoline’s antiknock properties. Octane and Engines The two-stroke engine in motorcycles and the four-stroke engine in cars require two different, specific-octane gasoline. However, the four-stroke engine requires relatively low-octane gasoline. (Nearly all current low-octane gasolines can actually be used in low-grade engines, such as those found on most cars.) The average gasoline-burning car engine can operate on two-or three-octane gasoline as long as one of two rules is observed: 1. The higher two AK numbers must be less than 12.0. The AK number is based on the average of two consecutive compressions. 2. If an engine uses three different octane numbers and more than one of those numbers is greater than 7.5, then the highest number must be less than 7.5. Note: if, however, you run up to the limit, then preignition (knocking) may result. And there’s a good chance the engine will “blow” (detonate) unless it is equipped with a “hot” (high-compression) piston. This can happen even with low-grade (grade) unleaded gasoline because of the compression and temperature. (There is no octane rating on kerosene, and there is not even any standard way—so far—to measure its AK number.) If you have a high-performance engine, for example, an engine with a maximum compression ratio of 7.6 and an AK number requirement of 9.9, then you must use a gasoline with a minimum AK number requirement of 9.9.

        "output": "How can I fix a leaking roof? The first step is to figure out how much it will cost to hire someone to fix your roof. Once you get an estimate on the damages and repairs you need to get a quote on how they will be fixed. If you feel that you can safely make the repairs yourself and are confident that you can do a good enough job to support the cost of repairs yourself, then you should consider doing the work yourself.\nAsphalt is the cheapest material available. It has a certain tenaciousness, and can be applied by machine in large quantities. This is the \"cold applied\" method. Cold applied asphalt is generally used to make large roof repairs. Cold applied is the method of choice for large commercial or institutional buildings.\nOne advantage of asphalt is that the material can be made \"self healing\". It is possible to place a plastic membrane under the asphalt and this would allow a small amount of liquid to leak under the membrane. The liquid would be absorbed by the heated asphalt.\nThere are specialized roofing contractors who have cold applied systems - they offer asphalt repair kits in kit form - and they can also offer to make repairs to leaking and cracked asphalt roofs.\nAsphalt is generally the least expensive repair material, and can be used to stop leaks from small repairs as well as large leaks."

        "instruction": "How do you get water in the desert?",
        "output": "How do you get water in the desert? Build a 35-mile aqueduct bringing water from 240 miles away! This aqueduct transports water from the Colorado River to cities like Phoenix and Tucson, but it isn’t easy to bring water halfway across the country. How do you get enough water to go nearly 35 miles? Answer: How to send water a half mile away! Water has weight – 62.5 pounds per gallon, which means the water in the pipeline is 108 million pounds of water. That will weight down any pipe – and it can break! There are special fittings and connectors to protect and keep the water moving smoothly. The pipeline was built in 1931 and still carries water for the Southwest today!\n7. How do you keep an aqueduct from freezing? Answer: How to make an aqueduct resistant to freezing? Temperature can affect the flow rate of water in pipes, and this can cause water to freeze and break pipes. To prevent this, the top meter of the aqueduct is at a shallow sixty degrees, to minimize water loss. An anti-freeze known as glycol is also used. Glycol has a lower freezing point than water, so as water freezes, glycol helps take up the space and keeps the pipe from breaking. The bottom twenty-five meters underground are kept naturally colder – around 32 degrees – to protect the aqueduct for the harsh environment.\n1. How do you get water from the river? Answer: How to move water from the river to Phoenix? The Colorado River is used to carry water to cities all across the desert Southwest – through aqueducts and pipelines. Arizona diverts water from the river through the Central Arizona Project. First, the Colorado River is diverted through a dam. The reservoir is so big that its weight can keep the water high, without a pumping system constantly working to send water through the aqueduct. The water from the reservoir is sent by gravity through a sixty-mile canal. Then, the water goes through a canal that travels over one hundred miles, but there isn’t enough water in the channel for the canal to carry water. To keep the water moving on this long route, sixty inches of concrete is put under the canal for a mile, so the canal can “float” on top of this hard concrete and move water without being weighed down. Then, the water travels to the Phoenix area on another canal. Once in Phoenix, one third of the water is released as a backup, so if a break occurs to part of the canal, there is still enough water to use at the cities.\nHow do you build a city in a desert? Answer: How to build the perfect suburban city in the desert? When you want to build a suburban city far away from the city centers, there are challenges to overcome, including costs and supplies. To create a Phoenix “from the desert”, the land had to be bought and transported over 800 miles from the Mojave Desert to the new city site. This is similar to the aqueduct: water was transported across 400 miles from the Central Valley. Transporting the land caused problems: when moving the earth, if you dig too deep, you dig into sandstone; if you dig too shallow, the land moves as the water evaporates from the ground. A lot of time and money went into moving the land. The land was transported in 7,300 railroad cars, each holding 60,000 cubic feet of material! With all the land being moved, there were also challenges of getting water and power to the site. Finally, with the land in place, there were many challenges to building a civilization in the desert. One of the first challenges was growing vegetation, since Phoenix is at a higher elevation than any of the cities around it, it gets colder at night and planting vegetation in the winter can be frozen by snow. To combat this, plastic tunnels of greenhouse-like construction were built across the entire city to give the plants a warmer night and allow them to continue growing. The tunnels made it possible for all sorts of plants to thrive and grow without being frozen or unable to get enough water in this desert environment.\n1. What are the biggest challenges to building a city in the desert? How do you prevent plants from freezing? Why is it advantageous for a city to have no winter? Answer: How to move cities to deserts? Once you’ve transported your large amount of land to your city site, you’ve begun"

Looking forward to hearing from you.\nBest regards, and a hug to your daughter.\nCongratulations! You will be a great Mom. Your daughter is really gorgeous.\nI would like to try making empanadas, but I have a specific request. I would like to learn how to make the empanadas that are wrapped in a cresent shape--they have more of a fried potato/egg shape, and are very delicious. I've found this recipe [http://eatathomeblog.com/recipes/empanadas-with-potato-cheese-and-onions/], but it doesn't look like it's the ones I'm describing, and I'd prefer to learn to make them myself rather than buy them. Thank you, and congratulations again.\nThere are many varieties of Empanadas in Argentina.\n1. Fill each empanada with about 1/3 potato, 1/3eggs and 1/3 onion. Use a pastry bag to pipe in the potato and onion to make sure it is spreads evenly throughout the empanada.\n2. Leave a small strip on the end to form a triangle.\n3. Fold 1/2 triangle over and press the triangle into the 1/2 triangle that was turned over to create the crescent shape.\nThat is the way I usually make them. Usually I make them with a blend of potato, onion and egg, they are very tasty.\nSorry, that was not the way I usually make them.\nWhat I usually do is leave the open end un-folded and then after forming the triangular shape, I fold the triangle over. Hope this helps.\nFollow step 3 on the recipe above.\nI'm making a sliced meat pie (huevos al cocinado) and the recipe calls for a combination of salsa criolla (creole sauce) and vinager. The vinager is not as important to the dish as the creole sauce. Could I sub balsamic vinager for the creole sauce?\nJust made these and they turned out delicious!! I made two changes: used chile colorado instead of the dried chile and omitted the vinegar to be dairy free. Very well received at the office and I love putting those leftovers all together for lunch tomorrow! Exactly the kind of quick dish that would work well in our lunches!\nI have to say that this is a really easy and delicious meal. I made the whole thing in half a hour, and that includes the meat cooking time (I used leftover chuck roast and simmered it in beef stock, so it took a while). The flavors and combination of textures are so good, too. It went over well with my dinner guests, and the next day I managed to heat up most of the leftovers for lunch. Excellent and easy - I'll definitely make it again.\nI would like to try this recipe with boneless short ribs. How do I alter the preparation?\nMade the huevos al cocinado tonight, and it was delicious! My family loved it, and I really appreciated the ease and quickness of putting this together. It was also cheap to make, and very tasty - a win across the board! Thank you so much!\nThis is an amazing recipe. I can’t believe I haven’t come across it before. If I would to make the recipe for one person, how much meat should I use and how much sauce. If I would use 3/4 lb of meat, will I have enough sauce to cover it for one person. How many servings does the recipe make?\nI make it for lunch the other day and it was very good.\nThe recipe makes roughly 6 individual servings. I would suggest cutting the recipe in half and adjusting the sauce as needed (you will have leftover sauce).\nI used the sauce in the recipe but I didn't have vinegar so I substituted in some lime juice and it"

        "output": "I have my grandfather's antique fountain pen and a bottle of ink, but have never done this before. Can you tell me how to refill the fountain pen? It' s been over forty years since I've used one. Thanks in advance for……\nYou might have to read some old books on fountain pens to do it but I have found a couple of ways to make it easier to reside a pen. I am not sure if what I’m recommending is what you are doing or what, but I’ll try. Firs…t of all let us beware that this is the original and unmodified design. Read the instructions, if not in your hand already. Don’t make modifications. Be sure to read the instructions as there are a lot of pitfalls. You’ve got some old ink that’s a color you like. You don’t want to waste a drop but you don’t have a bottle of that color. I will tell you what to do but it is a little complicated. I will assume that it is a dip-proof nib or that a convertor ring will do the trick. You have two different bottles and you want to try to get one colored ink that matches closely to the others. You will need an eye dropper or three. A catheter that you don’t need any more for a different procedure. You will need a paper bag. Make sure it is big and strong. I will also assume that you will be using an ink that doesn’t need to be filtered with a filter. It will be in the instructions but read it anyway. Place the pen point down on a sheet of paper where it cannot spread and put a dot of ink and draw straight, not curved, a line with the tip of the pen. Use a marker to place a straight line at a certain distance. It would be from the center of the nib. With the bottle of colored ink, fill a clean bottle with a spout. Then fill the eye dropper with enough of the color that it is brimming. If you don’t have enough, you need to decide if you are going to use a third bottle. This is a fountain pen and I don’t think they were all made at the same time so I don’t know if the first filling you will get any old writing fluid from your ink bottle or not. If not, stop filling now. Now pour in enough of a different color to make it different, but close enough to match the third bottle. There is a good deal of experimentation necessary here to make up for the lack of modern ink. You only need a little to be safe that you will have enough for the next step. Now fill the second bottle with the color you can’t get. It will be a close match with some darkening. It is a little darker than the third bottle. The third bottle will be a good match to the original bottle. Add enough of the second bottle to fill the eye dropper in your left hand. In your right hand, use the paper bag and tie it with a knot to close it. It needs to be close to your left hand so I would recommend you don’t cross your arms. The opening of your arm should be close to your hand. Now take the pen and let it drip so the nib will dip and drip. The eye dropper is filled with the correct ink and so is the bottle on the pen. Be ready for the first drop to come and fill it. It will be full. Take the catheter and place it in the second bottle of ink until it is full. Now you are ready to do the experimentation. I would recommend making three or four lines using all the ink you have on hand. It will be three colors. When you are satisfied with the color, you are ready to refill. Put a drop in the tip and use it to drip onto a paper until it is empty. Wait a few seconds and then put another drop. You don’t want to wait long or you will be diluting the color by not having enough ink but you don’t want to put three drops for one line. It takes the correct mix to get the color you want and so you have to experiment. Put the dropper in the bottle and fill it until about a half inch is left. Add enough of the second color to mix with the original color, more of it than you did for the third color. It should turn out darker because the three colors are more diluted. Take the pen and let the nib drip. Don’t take the catheter away until it is almost empty. You will know when it is the right time to take it out."

        "output": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Hong Kong  dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Tong Sui? Thank you.\nAnswer: Tong Sui is the Cantonese name for egg tarts. While it sounds like a Chinese dessert it is not. It actually came to Hong Kong from Macau by way of Portugal.\nSo how did an egg tart become an important symbol of the SAR? It is said that the government was so hard up that they decided to use Hong Kong tarts to raise funds.\nThe name of the dessert derives from its main ingredient, egg yolks. Egg yolks are not permitted to be imported into mainland China because of its high protein content. This has a special meaning for Hongkongers who are very proud of their unique cultural identities, and egg tarts are one of them. Many Hongkongers would probably feel the same about the Chinese mainland.\nIn the Hong Kong tarts, the crust and filling are made from the same ingredients, both made from flour. One would not say the crust is better than the filling. In fact it is very important for a perfect egg tart to have a crust that is slightly burnt. The secret is in the oven. The egg tarts also need to be well chilled.\nSo how do you make this Chinese dessert? Take a clean plastic bag and put your egg yolks in, then tie up the bag and shake it vigorously. The result, you hold in your hands a ball of egg yolks, that just begs to be turned into an egg tart.\nTo make the egg crust, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together, then stir in the flour, salt and butter. Shape into an 8 inch round and line with baking paper.\nLine a baking tin (for a 17cm tart) with shortcrust (or puff) pastry, blind bake for 30 minutes then bake for another 30 minutes.

I usually take them around Hong Kong and Kowloon to the places they want to go and in the process, I hope to also learn more about these parts of Hong Kong.\nI used to live in a public housing apartment in Aberdeen where my parents would sometimes visit. This apartment was built by the British in the early 20th Century. I was once told that originally, Aberdeen was where the European powers were to meet up.\nMy mother told me, though, that my grandfather, a British soldier, used to frequent Aberdeen. I found this hard to believe; my grandfather died before I was born. But it could be true. My grandfather's father, who was born in the early 1900s, apparently married a Chinese woman from Hong Kong.\nMy grandfather, a British soldier, and his Chinese wife lived in Canada, then eventually the U.K. He is buried in the U.K., not China or Canada. His wife's family did emigrate from Hong Kong to Canada before the Second World War. I don't know if my grandfather's wife is still living in Canada or not.\nI have never been to Canada to visit my grandfather's grave or the house where he lived with his wife. I was never very close to my grandfather. I did however spend time with the Chinese side of my family in Vancouver Canada, my grandfather's native land.\nSome things I learned from my grandfather's Chinese wife's family were how to knit (it's been years now though), play cards and even a bit of cooking (I still use the knitting patterns and recipes today); so these are all things my mother did not teach me (I'm guessing, though, my mother learned these things from her mother).\nI'm also reminded that my mother is not a Hong Kong native.

They also offer a soil testing service through NY State if you’d like to find out exactly what kind of soil you have.\nhttps://www.nifa.usda.gov/\nThe other things for Ethiopia are:\n1. You can have fruit trees planted in the fall to have fruit in two years\n2. You can have crops that are a good source of protein, which might be a little higher in cost, and so this is a good source for the next few years, like legumes. It would be a good idea to have a diversifying type of food, and not just food for your family.\nNancy October 17, 2018 - 7:44 PM\nI just received a lot of vegetable seeds from my garden and have all my paperwork for the new seeds from my other gardening friends who also have small gardens. I want to have a big veg patch but just can’t figure out how to get rid of the weeds, please help.\nHow to Get Rid of Weeds: A few weedkillers do a fantastic job, including Preen.\nHow to Get Rid of Weeds: You can also get weed cloth which blocks light and keeps weeds from growing.\nHow to Get Rid of Weeds: I like to use a weed fabric called Weed Blank. You don’t have to pull it back or cut it up to get rid of it. You just dig up to the soil line and plant. When you harvest, dig up below the soil line again to get rid of weeds, but you can cut the weed material off with a pair of shears. This can be laid out on the soil to block light when you have weeds.\nMost weed cloth can also be sown, in other words with a thin weed fabric you can grow crops so that it just covers the soil.\nHow to Get Rid of Weeds: If you are doing large commercial gardening, there are a lot of weed killers like Roundup that are effective.\nHow to Get Rid of Weeds: I would never use Roundup without a mask, unless by a stream. It is a bad idea to get that on your skin, and you also don’t want to use it around your children, unless of course they are playing in the stream.\nHow to Get Rid of Weeds: The best thing to do is do it by hand. The soil can start to get weedy as time goes on, and it becomes a cycle of you have to pull the weeds and then replant. The other thing to use is to just lay down a fabric to cover it or put mulch.\nMatthew M. October 17, 2018 - 11:06 PM\nI’m in Canada with our short growing season, what time of year is best to plant a garden? It can be very cold here and have only a few weeks of warmer weather in the summer. Thanks\nThe best time of year to plant in many places is around March. You can have a great season, but if you don’t have enough light it could be an issue. In the summer, light becomes a problem. You need to plan for 12 hours of light. In the first week of April, you can use lights, and if you can get light before that, you can. Someone said you put lights in a room in the basement, but light travels through the ceiling and roof. So, if you have the option to put light on the ceiling or roof, that’s another opportunity for light. If you do grow something in the basement or under the stairs, you have to provide air flow, so you can take your plants"

It is the dried material that should be stored in airtight containers that are protected from moisture and light. Rehydrating the herb is very simple, with the herb being placed in boiling water; usually a larger amount of boiling water is used than is needed, so extra water is used to ensure complete rehydration and that the herb maintains its flavor for the following days in the boiling pot.\nOther methods of drying plants involve the use of heat and pressure, which may be desirable for certain herbs. Dried material from these methods may be moister and stale; if this occurs, it may be rehydrated by soaking in water and straining. If the material is stale, it will not be suitable for use in food. For most herbs, however, freeze-drying is used.\nThis entry was posted in Home and Gardening and tagged Drying, Gardening, Herbs. Bookmark the permalink."

Indonesia fought an invasion war between 1975 and 1979, but after a 10-year resistance, East Timor declared its independence in 1999. Independence is the freedom to rule and run one place without foreign intervention. Independence is a very rare concept in East Timor. Indonesia became a nation in 1945. They decided to take over other parts of the country such as, Irian Barat (West New Guinea) and East Timor, and became colonisers. The invasion was a difficult one both in East Timor and in West New Guinea. A man named José Abrantes Pereira, was a Timorese hero, he was killed by the Indonesian army in the 1975 war. In this war the Indonesians, were the invaders, the Timorese were the defenders. In this war the Timorese soldiers fought with their machetes and wooden spears. The Portuguese, who used to administer East Timor, did not like the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government has been the leader of East Timor since Portugal left East Timor in 1999.\nEast Timor independence day celebration\nEAST TIMOR: A LONG ROAD TO GOVERNOMENT Independence Day Celebra\nThe independence of Timor-Leste (East Timor) took place on 16 May, 2002.

Find the area of a 20 sided die.”\nCan you help me do that? (It doesn’t say if it’s the area under a curve or something. I think it’s the area of a square with 20 sides.)\nYou add a dimension, so you'll need Pi, 20 in diameter. Do the algebra:\nYou will first need to use the definition of Area to get the equation a + 20 = 20 * s. This will allow you to solve for a. You will need a variable so I will call it 'b'. A equation would look something like this:\na = 20b or a = 20(s/20)\nWe can then solve for Area (a) by substituting the unknown letter with the equation that was determined and solving for Area which would look something like:\nArea = 20 * b\nThe Area would look something like this: Area = 400 b\nYou would need to solve for all of the unknown letters in order to solve. The answer would look something like this: Area = 400b.\nIf you still don't understand, or if this is wrong, please comment and explain the answer.\nFind the area of an isosceles triangle with base 4 and height 8.\nWhat is the equation for the volume of a cube of unit sides?\nwhat is the area of a square with unit sides?\nHow do you do math when you don't know the symbols?"

What are u going to do with them when all is said and done?\"\nMy \"blinds\" are still in their wrappers, waiting to be cut. If I ever go through them, I plan to cut out one design, use it as a test piece, then make copies of it as needed for more blinds.\nI'll post back here the experience and results I have, from making blinds.\nI have made the blinds, and I will be starting with an instructable this week, on how to make them.\n\"In response to the new post: ... What are u going to do with them when all is said and done?\"\nI really appreciate seeing the post on making the blinds. I have some that I would like to make after a quick refresher course on how they are put together. I will make it a goal to make more.\nI have made them too . they are in my window.\nI really didn't think I was going to be one to post on \"how to\" make window blind from a print, but here it the my take on it, and there will be follow ups. The first thing you have to do is take the printed window blind and cut out the windows. Now you can see where the trouble starts. First off it will have to be cut out in a computer. I have not tried that yet. I also have not tried cutting those windows just above the window size, I have however cut the window size out first and then trimmed everything in between the window size, with a razor blade and scissors. This way it keeps everything clean and easy to follow. The blinds come with string holes in almost every corner. Now I just run the string through those holes, this will make it easier to install. You will find a way to make the blinds hinged from the top, but beware, it is not difficult, in some areas you have to cut the fabric out before you can attach the hinges. This takes some patience on the part of the user. Now for this instructable I will have to explain the other way. The blinds I made are like a canvas blind, it is made out of 1 square of fabric with a couple of holes in it for string. It is fastened together in the middle, which makes it not hinged at the top , but I have done this in the past and have found it works great. I just fold the blind in the middle where it is fastened and hang it in the window. This will be the instructable I mention above so you can see how it works and look forward to part 2. That way I don't post everything now then you have to wonder how I got the print in the first place, so that is why I didn't make an instructable on that, you will have to look for the other instructable to know the print way, just follow the link I give for it. Now on to the pictures showing the process. I have a picture coming up of how to cut it out on a computer.\nThanks for the comments about your Instructables on this topic. It has been an issue for quite some time. The problem is not so much that the instructions are hard to follow, it's that most of them are out of date. I have decided to make a series of Instructables on this same topic and I am redoing all the ones that I can find outdated. I have discovered that there are two versions of these available. One is only one piece of fabric that wraps around the outside of the wooden dowel. The second version is one piece of fabric that is wrapped then is connected to the other side by means of a hinged mechanism.\nIt's the second version I'm looking for and I can tell you that the one with the dowel is easier to make, but harder to hang because they are thinner and more fragile and more likely to be damaged by a rope or chain and less likely to be hung in the spring or fall during severe weather. The version with the dowel is almost exclusively used in Europe. I'm looking for the version with the hinged mechanism that is often used here in the Unites States.\nI'll probably be creating two Instructables. The first will be on the \"simpler version\" and the other will be on the more desirable hinged version. It won't be hard. Just have to do a little thinking to figure out how a person does this thing that has been forgotten about.\nThe more complex version (the one with the dowel) is called Sun Shade Maker in many"

        "output": "I want to talk about \"Smooth\",  a song by Rob Thomas.\nMy favourite song is \"Smooth\",  that song by Rob Thomas.\nIn the song the singer sings about a lady with a \"smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth/smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth\" face.\nBut the singer also admits that the woman is not his type:\nShe's wearing tight sweaters at the bar\nAnd I am wearing sweatpants\nI'm on the cover of GQ\nI'm never going outside again\nHe admits that the lady is \"not all that he wants\", that she is \"wearing tight sweaters at the bar\", but still says that he loves her face, which \"smooths, smooths, smooths\".\nIn fact, that is my favourite song - it talks about something I am experiencing every day.\nThe thing is that the singer wants a woman with a \"smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth\" face. But that lady doesn't have it at all. She loves jeans and sweatpants, and is not going outside anymore - she never walks or hikes, or does any physical things. She also drinks, does some drugs and is not interested in doing something about it.\nAnd this woman is not smooth: if you ask me, she is fat and smells like smoke and alcohol. That's why the singer doesn't want her. But he does love something from this woman - her face.\nShe probably has a pretty, lovely face with a sweet smile, but she wears no makeup, she has no pretty, sexy clothing. She doesn't look like the kind of woman a man would desire in the morning - with lashes and long, light-brown hair, pretty, sexy clothing and perfume. No, that's not a woman who can be desired.\nIt's a lot of lucky circumstances that she looks good: she has a pretty face, which she loves to wear makeup but she doesn't because she doesn't really care. And her hair is healthy, long and the colour is nice, too - she also doesn't care so much about it.\nBut the lucky circumstances are also that her facial beauty doesn't look like a cheap, fake one. It's natural, without some kind of makeup that make you look younger, that you want to attract men - you look feminine, girlish and not like a hardened, sexist woman. That's her good luck. She looks feminine, but it's not cheap, fake femininity, it's true femininity.\nThe only thing left to talk what this woman doesn't like to do is exercise. It's not a feminine thing to take care of your body and mind. A female can take care of her body and mind at home - without any effort. But it would also mean that she has no other interests in life than that. She does have other interests in life. It's just that she is not interested in taking care of her body or mind at all.\nShe is the way she is, just because she doesn't need to take care of herself. Because that's not really necessary.\nShe takes care of her children, she loves her man. If she gets ill or fat later in life, it's probably because she has no man anymore and has no time for him, either.\nSo that's a woman, probably. That's the best way I can describe it. But that woman is not a woman who really cares about taking care of herself - she looks good in the morning, but after that she usually wears something simple that does not attract much attention, because she doesn't care about looking good.\nShe is a mother, too. She cares about her children, and that makes her a good woman.\nIt's pretty common. Many ladies look that way. It's very hard to find a woman who is interested in dressing up, wearing makeup and doing something with herself. This can be a woman who is good-looking and is interested in looking good, and a woman who is plain and doesn't care about the way she looks.\nAnd it's probably why the singer of the song \"Smooth\",  does not like the way his lady looks. After all, she does not care enough to take good care of herself, and she is not good-looking. And that's not what we men really look at in a women. It's the femininity - looking elegant, classy and beautiful.\nIt's true:\nA smooth woman is not a woman who looks like it took some efforts,"

        "output": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Bolivian dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Chola Sandwich? Thank you, it is sure to go along with a few nice wines at my house with guests. A Chola Sandwich is just a baguette toasted and crusted, with your favorite meat on the top of the bread, just like the sandwiches they serve in France. A good quality baguette like a French baguette is preferred; and with a squeeze of lime, it is just perfect. To make the Chola Sandwich: a perfect sliced bread sandwich is the one where the bread is not too thick  or crust is burnt; it should be just right. I like to toast and crunch the French baguette. After toasting it completely, spread some butter or mayonnaise just a little; and with  the sliced bread that is not too thick, this sandwich is perfect. And this Chola Sandwich can be served as an open sandwich, as well with the butter or mayonnaise.  105  I like to make this sandwich as an open sandwich with some quality cold cuts like Italian cold cuts. So, spread the Italian cold cuts just across the bread, and if you prefer, you can make it as a closed sandwich by placing the meat in the middle of the slice of bread.  I make this Chola Sandwich with my favorite beef, like an Italian beef with onions & beef; it is just perfect with the French bread of the baguette, and I just cannot say no to this sandwich. The recipe is simple and  a little time consuming, but it is good. To make this sandwich: this recipe needs a little time to get the perfect balance of flavors. Put some beef, onions, salt, pepper,  and rosemary together; and get it to the boiling point. Turn off the heat and let it sit a little, so the beef gets fully flavored. Remove the onions and put the beef in the pot to boil for a little bit longer. After some time remove the  beef from the heat and drain the water from the beef; and then place the beef in a cold water for about five minutes. Soak the beef for this amount of time, and then fry the beef with some oil in the pan, the same oil in which you boiled the beef. And then after your beef is fried with  some oil, drain the oil from it. 112  It is better to make this recipe with some leftover cold cuts, like the cold cuts are really good and  you can take any good quality cold cuts and make the Chola Sandwich. I like to make this in a pan and then make this into an open sandwich, because the way I make it, the onion in the beef adds special  flavor. So while the onion is in with the beef, you just fry the bread until browns are done. With my French baguettes, this bread browsns a perfect bit in about two minutes. The French baguette  is what I usually use for the sandwich; but you can use other kinds of bread like Italian, and a good quality bread. And then you can sprinkle some salt, pepper and rosemary and the other herbs if your like. And then make an open sandwich and eat it like that, because eating it with bread and meat is just perfect and is just what I like.  113  I am making the Chola Sandwich again, it is really good and very simple. So I am making some nice beef with onions, salt, pepper and  rosemary. Put some beef, onions, salt and pepper together in the pot and get it to the boiling point. Turn off the heat and let it sit a little bit,  so the beef gets fully flavored, and then remove the onions so that the beef gets flavored and drained. Put the beef in the colling water and soak for about five minute after you drain the water. And then place the beef with  some oil in the pan and fry the beef and drain the oil completely. You can eat this like an open sandwich or close it as a sandwich altogether.  And then for this recipe you can take any good quality cold cuts that are available for the sandwich in the refrigerator. You can take any"

There was a terrible thing going on in Hitler’s Germany and there were terrible things happening to the Jewish people; there was a terrible thing happening to the native Australian people. What is going on here? The Jews were not the only people who were exterminated, there were different people. In this way, it is the same story of extermination and the elimination of people; there are people who live or are in the concentration camps, people who live in the outside world and they are unaware of what is going on inside the concentration camp; the person on the surface is completely unaware that one million people are being murdered by the concentration camps, one million people are being exterminated, just like one German or American person did not know about the Jewish people inside the concentration camps, that one million Jewish people were slaughtered in concentration camps just like these.\nEVERYONE: One million people?\nJOY: The Nazis killed one million German women, children and little girls.

Fast foods are not good to our body, that fact is very obvious. But our fast food cravings will make us feel like fast food is the only food to satisfy a munchy or a craving. The fact is that, fast foods are harmful to our body. Fast food are not very cheap and they may offer delicious food at very affordable prices, this is an obvious lie. Fast foods are harmful to our body. A lot of people get sick not because of a disease, but because of the unhealthy food they eat, so in my point of view, if we eat the food in the fast foods, we will get sick. This is a very bad habit for us because we will eat so much because it is cheap and yummy. Sometimes I want to throw up after eating a meal from a fast food for a while now. We can eat fast without compromising our health. There are a lot of food that is healthier then fast foods like bread and eggs. Now I know that to be healthy we need to take of our body as best as we could."

        "output": "Can you give any tips on how to cook a juicy, medium-rare steak? If youre grilling the meat, take the temperature of the meat and make your adjustments to cook it to your desired temperature. If your steak is still frozen from the fridge, it will take approximately 30 minutes per pound to thaw it. Once thawed, you can either pat it dry or make a marinade to help tenderize the meat. I would suggest you marinate your meat for at least 30 mikes, you could marinate it any longer than this, it wont hurt it. If youre grilling the meat, take the temperature of the meat and make your adjustments to cook it to your desired temperature.\nSimply season your meat, and let it sit on the kitchen counter or in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, or even overnight. Dont wash it before cooking either! You can cut some fat off now, though, if you wish. While your steak is sitting you can make the marinade if you want. Wrap the meat in aluminum foil, and place it in a roasting pan. Dont bother with a sear or a crust, that will be done on the grill. The meat should rest for about ten minutes before serving. If you make a steak house sandwich, your meat should be thick and rare. However, the steak should be at least an inch thick or it probably will dry out when broiled. If you eat your steak hot in the store or at a restaurant, then it will cook on the inside quicker because it has already been cooked. Most of the steak stores today will cook the meat in a broiler and then serve it off a hot griddle. If you do not cook your steak at home, make sure you get a piece that is at least 5/8 to 3/4 of an inch thick. Certainly, if you order it that way in a steak house, they can do that, too. However, since it is a big chunk off a cow, it takes a long time to cook, so it is better to order it medium rather than a very, very rare steak."

It was made from 1949 until 1976 (though it was discontinued in 1965 and reintroduced in 1972), but the only years in which it was made in large quantities was 1950 through 1955. It was made of stainless steel, hardened stainless steel (a variant made by International Sporting Arms), or matte blued steel. The barrel is made of steel, unlike the Model 66 and Model 12.\nIt is a very stout revolver, similar in many ways to the Colt Python (.357 Magnum revolver) and Smith & Wesson Model 12 (.44 Magnum) Model 12 (.44 Magnum). However, it differs in that it is slightly shorter, about .5 in (12.7 mm) shorter than the Model 12, and it has a 7 1⁄2 in barrel (for comparison, the Model 12 barrel length is 7 3⁄4 in or 196 mm). However, it also does not handle as well as the Model 12 since the longer barrel of the Model 12 allows the six-inch barrel to be balanced perfectly, whereas the balancing is off on the 6-inch 10-6. The 10-6 has a wooden grip that differs slightly from that of the Model 12 and Model 66.\nThe revolver is intended for large- frame .38 special +P cartridges. While some .38 S&W cartridges were also used in the 1949-1965 variants, only modern large- frame .38 +P cartridges are used. Modern large-frame cartridges used in this revolver include:\n.357 Magnum (.357 Mag +P)\n.41 Magnum (.41 Mag +P and .41 Mag +P+ cartridges)\n.44 Magnum (.44 Mag +P+ cartridges)\nThe Smith & Wesson Model 10-6 .38 Special revolver was produced from 1949 until 1976, with the first 4 years production during the era of World War II (1941-1945). In those first 4 years production, Smith & Wesson produced approximately 100,000 Model 10-6 revolvers. When the Korean War began in 1950, and as a result of World War II, it was common for Americans to buy firearms for personal defense. During this time, S&W and Colt manufactured a number of \"Wartime Models\". These revolvers are identical except that they have \"WARTIME MODEL\" stamped on the left side of the frame over the trigger. Production of the Model 10-6 ceased in August 1955 and was reintroduced in April 1972. It was then discontinued again in 1976. 25,800 total Model 10-6 revolvers were manufactured (including the reintroduced variant).\nSmith & Wesson Model 10-6 revolver: A large, sturdy revolver that has a steel frame, large- size frame, 1 ounce (28 g) trigger pull, six-shot cylinder, barrel length of 7 1⁄2 in (191 mm), and overall length of 10 in (254 mm)\nBarrel: 7 1⁄2 in (191 mm) (for revolver in picture)\nSafety is a half-cock notch on the hammer\nSmith & Wesson Model 10-6 revolver: Stainless steel, hardened steel, and matte blued steel:\nHardened steel\nSmith & Wesson Model 10-6 vs. Model 66 vs. Model 12: The Smith and Wesson Model 10-6 is a large-frame, double- action revolver that was manufactured with a steel frame, larger cyl"

        "output": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses? If a bank lost its ability to earn profits, maybe it's worth less than zero? I am not saying it is, or that even if a bank loses a lot of money, it can't make it the next day. What I am asking is, how could the cash be used by the bank as a temporary buffer (capital) without its being considered as equity? Why capital should always be equity instead of cash, when it is still the same bank? I think the FDA could also benefit from it.\nWe are always told that the USD is the world's reserve or base currency. What does this mean? That the banks can hold on to it? I was asked to hold on to my USD so that's what they do. The government has never borrowed and held on to any of that USD. There has been no capital and there is no capital. So what does such a reserve currency signify? I don't get it.\nThis reminds me of the 1997 crisis: What makes the USD (and other government bonds which are USD-denominated) special and different from the bank's own asset (which is also a USD-denominated bond but not so good)? I would say the answer is nothing, but I was told not to be cynical.\nI would really like to understand this.\nIt's the US as a nation.\nIf the US is no longer a nation, I really don't know.\nI don't feel like I have made any progress on that answer.\nIf so, then it's the US as a nation.\nI would really like to understand this. It's the US as a nation. If the US is no longer a nation, I really don't know. I don't feel like I have made any progress on that answer.\nYou got it. The US as a nation.\nI am not American but I get it. The same goes for all countries, and maybe even groups of people. What I'm getting at is, what does it mean to be part of a nation? How can a nation keep on being one after what happened to Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan? I feel like I should know what I am talking about instead of just making some random comments.\nIn my case, what I feel is that a nation is a group of people that feel like they belong to each other. So by losing the statehood that made them belong to each other, they have also lost their nation.\nI'm glad I got your point. How did you think we were going to end this?"

The “Inform and Protect Yourself” workshop was a free two-hour interactive educational discussion concerning information sharing between Vietnamese immigrants and the FBI.\nThe goals of these workshops are to increase public knowledge of informants’ actions, to develop safe tactics when informing about family members or acquaintances. The workshop also highlighted the importance of making educated decisions about our communities by engaging our government in discussions.\nThe Vietnamese-American Online informant, Huong Lam, spoke first at the workshop and explained what a Vietnamese informant with an intelligence background would do in order to extract information from a Vietnamese-American, such as using “cultural shocks” by suggesting a trip. The cultural shocks are to make Americans feel that they are being a good and generous citizen by sending money to the informant for charity, and that they are being a great friend by staying at their house.\nThis strategy is very effective, because most Vietnamese Americans are proud and generous. According to Lam, the Vietnamese Americans usually help when they are asked by anyone for any kind of assistance. For this reason, an intelligent informant could easily manipulate a Vietnamese American into doing things that they would not otherwise do.\nAfter the cultural shocks come the language pressure and the threats. In most situations, the pressure on the informant’s family is just as important as the direct pressure on him or her. Most of the time, the informant fears the consequences that his/her family will have to face in their community, the deportation of themselves, or of their family members. It is very typical of Vietnamese to try to protect their children from harm.\nHuong Lam pointed out the importance of having knowledge about the information the US Government wants us to share with them. The US government wants to know where in the United States all Vietnamese are, whether they are employed, are student, are unemployed, have kids, don’t have kids etc. Once an individual starts sharing their family information, there is not going to stop collecting information.\nWithin the discussion, participants were asked to share their personal experiences, if any. I was the first of the participants to speak and share my thoughts. When the US government asked me to help with “terrorism investigations,” and to send them names of “other Vietnamese” in the U.S., I felt very upset. I was in the middle of dealing with a death in my family.\nI don’t think my grandpa would have sent anyone else in our family into an investigation, even if we did not have the capacity to pay the informant. Moreover, it was very upsetting to learn that my grandpa had to go to court to tell the judge to not make my grandpa send someone else in the family to a court.\nLuckily, my grandfather knows the law better than me. This made me realize that I should probably talk to my parents about the whole situation. It was also very surprising for me to hear that my grandpa had to talk to the judge in order to tell the judge that I was the only one in the family who had the responsibility and resources to send someone to the government.\nI also found it interesting to learn that people are very vulnerable when they have to deal with losing someone. The Vietnamese American Online informant then talked about how it was very important to be able to know the language the FBI speaks when dealing with Vietnamese Americans, so that the government can not only trick Vietnamese Americans and get their information but also to protect oneself from others in the community.\nHuong Lam talked and made joking remarks that the Vietnamese Americans who cooperated with the FBI, and gave the government information, especially ones living in the suburbs of Massachusetts, would be considered by people in Massachusetts to be “traitors.” When they go out to eat in Vietnamese restaurants, they would not be welcomed and would be looked down and disrespected by Vietnamese American people living in Massachusetts.\nIt is even more surprising that people in Vietnam, for example, do not think that the US government does not collect information on the political activities of Vietnamese immigrants here in the US. They believe that there is freedom of speech and the US government does not collect this type of information on the people"

Post by: E-tard 35-8-1 23:56\n2. RE: Need help.\ni think bioengineering is a good idea. it is a good foundation with a lot of biochemistry and other subjects that are related like computer science, statistics, etc. it shows you that you can think out side of the box and have a broad view on various things. it will make you a more competitive candidate when you apply.\nyour biochemistry will be important as bioengineers usually have experience in the field\nchemistry can never hurt either. i would say that bioengineering will prepare you the best for life in grad school though. i just think bioengineering is a good idea. it is important to understand things from the basic science point of view. it is important to become very aware of what is going on in the world and not just what is going on in your own field. it is also good to understand that the basic science is not as basic as people tend to think and it is not as simple as most people make it out to be. a lot of good bioengineering work is done by people in the life science fields who do not consider themselves to be bioengineers but that would be a good thing for you to learn.\nI see. Thanks a lot. Could you suggest me other things to study?\nsure bw. i'm a big believer in learning things. if things interest you, you can always learn something new. my rule of thumb, however, since time is money, is that if I think something will be useful enough in the future, i get it done. with that in mind the things that i would do is:\n1. Learn the basic statistics. you can find basic statistics online or just google it. i would say 50% of graduate school is learning to calculate stuff. this includes things like correlation, covariance, normalization of data (mean, standard deviation, etc), standardizing data, doing a student analysis (t test, ANOVA, etc), and plotting data.\n2. Learn computer programming or if you already know it work more advanced stuff. if this is what your research focus is, then you must understand the programming part behind the research that you will do otherwise it will be hard for you (and your lab) to advance. computer programming is the language of science and it's very important\n3. you can take any type of course that interests you. i have a friend that took an entire course and learned how to fly stunt kite (you would be surprised how much of his graduate school work has been directly related to this course). i think it is a good idea to take courses that are only useful to you and not your program. i think a good idea is to take a writing, music, math, sociology or other very random courses and learn them.\ni would say if at all possible learn computer programming. if you already know it go beyond the basics. the basics of programming are learned in the first year. learning computer programming is something that takes a lifetime. my graduate school had a programming class for people who wanted to learn more computer programming and those are things you will never learn in biochem or the hard sciences.\na good idea is to take a writing, music, math, sociology or other very random courses and learn them\nthese courses aren't that random. the point is that many things are interdisciplinary. i agree that you should take classes but they have to be useful.\ni agree that you should take classes but they have to be useful.\nit is not what is useful but what is interesting to you. if you think it would be interesting to learn how to sew, it probably is not useful but it is something that you can go do. if you can do this and enjoy it, then go to school to do this. a lot of what you do in research is interesting to you.\nI get this. So, let's suppose I decide to learn programming or data analysis. Do you suggest I start by reading a tutorial? Or is it best to take a course? Also, I'm thinking of learning guitar. Do you think it's useful to do? What do you recommend?\nguitar is good if it would interest you. but there is no point in going to guitar class when"

We are not experts and we do not go to the same places in Europe and as far as I am aware, we are not the experts!\nWhat ever the travel TV presenters may tell us we should or should not do, our experience may be totally different.\nThis is not fair on them.\nThis is not fair on us.\nOn top of this, we are paying money, to go on holidays and we know we are not the most intelligent, clever people on the planet, or as the travels say, we know we are not travelling experts.\nWhat ever happened to the honesty that we are looking for? All these travel TV presenters are experts at saying yes, but where is the honesty.\nYes maybe they do get invited, free or they may get an all expenses paid holiday and they may be told to go to one hotel this year, another hotel the next time they go and so on.\nWe know from the TV that they have a lot of people running around, organising things, they have someone making them look smart, they have someone who is looking after them while they are on holiday and some of the travel TV presenters get more money from the newspapers (who are paid by the holiday companies of course), than some people get from a full time job.\nWe watch this, we enjoy it, we are fascinated with it. We go and organise our holidays, not that we need to do it.\nI don't think the travel TV presenters realise that, when they go on holiday, they are in a position where many of the normal people can do the same!\nIs telling us what we should do, a good or a bad thing? Maybe a couple of them who started when the travel show were just starting, back in the day when holidays were cheaper, perhaps told us how to get the best value and I can remember that I learnt a lot from that.\nI then had a job and at night, when the kids were at school and they then had computers in schools, I still had time for an afternoon out and a week or so in the summer holidays.\nWhen I left home I still had time for short breaks.\nI think I got that from the TV.\nWhen money got tight, I still managed to go on holiday.\nHowever, I think they have a position of responsibility.\nWe take on board what they say and this is not a good thing.\nMost of us are looking for the right advice. Some will listen and some will not.\nAll I am saying, is tell us an honest opinion, what do you really think? If people still book and go to the places you think they should go or not go to, then I don't mind if the travel TV presenters get paid.\nHow can they say a couple or a family should go on a package holiday, when most of them, have not stayed in the same type of hotel for years. Some of them are in the very same hotels the same people who they are giving advice to are staying in?\nWhy is that ok? If someone on the travel TV presenter's team go and stay at a hotel, do they tell us and say they are staying there and what a bad hotel it is, because it is not one of the hotels they favour? or perhaps the hotel staff or management do not do the things which the travel TV presenter thinks is good hotel service?\nIf I see a travel TV presenter on my TV and they are telling us what places to go to, I would like to know if they are getting paid for it?\nDo we ask them about where they buy our clothes/shoes/mobile phone/gadgets etc and on what terms?

I felt that I was a fly in an ointment jar.\nI do think that Ivan Ilych made a transition from life to death, without a definite transition into an afterlife, and then transitioned back to “normal life,” although it might have been a continuation of his spiritual journey.

So can you see how this is a bit inconsistent/unfair?<br>Also, consider the 10-95 percent rule (http://www.dietitian.com/t-calorie-content-of-food&amp;category_name=81#81)....10% proteins x 400kcal = 40kcal, 95% carbohydrates x 400kcal = 360kcal. In this case, why isn't there 360kcal of 'carbohydrates'? It's pretty much just math, i.e...to find out how much all of the individual ingredients in the foods are contributing to the food's calorie value. I suppose that the 'calorie' value and weight percentage of individual ingredients in food is used to calculate how much of a calorie/gm of a food is available i.e. what percentage of the weight of the food is carbs, fats, protein etc. Also, from what I remember reading somewhere....the idea comes from the fact that the human body can only use about 80kcal per 1gm.<br><!-- Add comment -->\nI don't have an issue with the Calorie/g being given - it's simply used as a metric to see how much food is going to impact your calorie/fat intake if you eat X number of grammes. However, when the 'Calorie/kCal' is also given...then this can throw people off a bit, as we don't really eat grams and if you look at 100g of protein / carb / fat as a weight for the body then that'll give an accurate measurement I guess....it's just not one in my opinion that most people are going to want to try to measure/follow. When the weight for food is given, you need a more accurate measure with a 'gr' for grams in my opinion......then the Calorie/KCal will appear to be a more logical thing and will work. One last thing to think about is that the body will respond in a very different way to eating proteins, fats or carbohydrates i.e. you can store more fat in your body, your metabolism will work/be slower with the fats and carbs...and you can gain more muscle mass/strength than you would if you had protein for the meal (and the gym training).....this is where the Calorie/KCal starts to come in.....once we start thinking about eating for weight training or general muscle development e.g. gaining muscle or losing fat or maintaining muscle and fat, etc then the Calorie/kCal does start to make sense too.<br><!-- Add comment -->\nThe main reasoning for there to be a KCal unit is that it has been used for a long time and thus people are already used to it. It's a standard that works...and it's still easier to use. In terms of units, it's far more easier to convert 'Calories' to 'kcal' and far more people know what 1000kcal looks like than it is to try and convert 'Calories' into 'grams'. Of course, if we start going into KCal units then it's the other way...I might end up saying 'give me 2400Kcal and I'll give you 1000g of Protein (or whatever)'! And just in case you were wondering - in terms of storage/consumption, in the UK at least, I'm pretty sure that there IS an official standard for Calory/grammes of foods and one for 'kCal/gramme'. This is mainly an issue with foods that you'd buy in a supermarket and there is also an official standard of units for restaurants/c"

        "output": "Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister and can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes. What do they each have to spend? And do either of these teens have a chance to pay off their credit card and car loans in 10 years?\n“I definitely agree with the 10% rule,” Navina said, adding that a student can begin investing at 18 with just $500 a month, or $8,000 a year.\nThat’s great, but Navina had a bigger challenge than investing. She wanted to take out a mortgage on a house, but her credit was shot and she couldn’t get approved. So she enrolled in a credit course for high school students at her local bank, where she learned to fix her credit. She also learned to apply for college by filling out the FAFSA form for federal financial aid.\nNavina also found that with no income or student loans, a 20-year mortgage was out of her price range because it required that half her take-home pay go to pay off her loan. Even with two incomes, her sister was taking on a loan that would take up 70% of her family’s combined income.\n“I’m not sure I’ll be able to take out a mortgage at half my income because I’m not going to have student loans to help me,” Navina said. “I need to save up at least $10,000 for a mortgage. I want an eight-minute commute to school.”\nSo now this bright young woman had to take on a job because she really wanted to afford a car on her own. But she didn’t have a driver’s license or a car to insure. (Her family only has one car.) And the cost of her driver’s ed course, car loan payments and the $35 monthly insurance fee is equivalent to what she puts into her budget each month for food and entertainment.\nShe’s in a quandary. Saving up for a house is too time consuming because she needs more than four hours of free time each week. But taking on the expense of a car and insurance to go to work is impossible and eats up the hours she does have to work toward a college degree.\nHow did Navina get in this situation where she had to get a job when she’s trying to build her own career? The answer is fairly simple, I believe.\nNavina is a consumer who is still learning how to be smart about her spending and how to control her budget.\nNavina is a worker who is learning how to earn her way in the workforce, and she is being held back by her parents’ income because they are both unemployed and she is earning at least $50 per week more than they are. The family income is less than it really should be because Navina’s mom has been unable to find a job for a long time.\nMy suggestion to Navina is to learn about managing her spending and income better. Then she’ll be able to make the decisions about when to get a driver’s license, a job or a credit card.\nAnd most importantly, I suggest she spend some time on a career to become the professional who will guide other girls through the consumerism that will mark the next generation.\nMy advice is to follow these tips:\nSet a goal for saving, not spending.\nStart now. Even if you make $3 or $5 a week, use that to develop the habit of sticking to a budget that you set for yourself. Start by saving in an account your parents won’t be able to access. Put your allowance and other cash or change into a special “deposit” account. Then do the same with any income you earn so you can follow your own personal spending plan. This will require good money judgment about spending and saving more than $10 a week. But that will help you build the skills you’ll need to manage your own finances.\nBe the smart banker.\nAs the smart banker, learn to open and use a checking account to keep track of all your spending money. And use an online site like Mint.com to develop good habits of staying on budget by balancing your outflow and income. It’s easy to learn and free for this year, so sign up and go ahead and use the site.\nBe sure to read my previous post about how to get a mortgage to make a down payment on a home in your future.\nIf you don’t already have a job, get one now. One of the first things you must do"

        "output": "define a new language that contains words that are with numbers and letters such as 'IL9op' and the system will still work. For an additional safety feature, the user must still enter the password that was set before the system was enabled, and after entering the password another button will appear and when the click it everything will function as usual, such as 'enter date' will appear and when clicked 'IL9op' will appear. Another advantage of using the 'IL' (IL: English) language is that when a user does not enter the same password because he forgot it, he can still continue typing without worrying about pressing the 'enter' button 3 times or he can always go to the 'back' button in the browser and select it. The application will always work in any language and user does not need to set any language, because before using this application it will already be familiar with the 'IL9op' language and will work correctly. The disadvantage of this language is that, from a technical point of view, the application will need to be downloaded to the computer 3 times in order to install it. After this the user will only have to download the 2-3 applications that he will want to use. After the user will have the application downloaded to his hard drive 3 times he will be ready to use the language. It will be good if the applications which will use this language can detect the language automatically. It will be a better option if the user will define his language before downloading the application (from the browser), so that when the application which was not developed using this language will be downloaded the system will automatically detect the language and open an additional window on another screen telling him to choose his language, but this problem is not a big one and can still be improved.\nAs you can see the idea is brilliant, but implementation is a big job and this job would need a lot of programmers for a long time and this job is expensive also.\nIn this language application the user may have difficulties of reading in the new language, therefore, it is important to create additional buttons as illustrated in FIG. 4 for easier reading or the user can turn on translating all text to English, which is illustrated in FIG. 5. These buttons are very important, because a lot of users will use this language.\nIf this language is used on the applications where an operator is required to input data such as on the applications of a vehicle, a car, etc. with a lot of buttons, it is recommended to use a touch screen for easier use or use a program to simulate the touch screen which the user can download from our site or from any other sites that we can trust. The program can be downloaded from our site or any other site and will be written in the 'IL9op′ language and will need to be downloaded to each computer 3 times.\nThe new language is written in 'English' script and does not need to be translated, so it will be very useful in the future when new applications which support this language shall be developed.\nThere are a lot of advantages and disadvantages in this idea, but I think that this idea can be used successfully in the market, because it can be very useful in the future and will be very successful.\nThe new language can be used in the future in the new and existing applications. With this language, the user will type in smaller characters, but the size of the text in the applications will be bigger.\nIn order to implement this idea, I am looking for some programmers to create this language and to create the additional buttons and to find a place which offer free web space, because this application will be used on the Internet or on the PC.\nThis idea can be used on the applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Google Chrome, Outlook, Thunderbird, Opera etc.\nThis idea can be used in all applications that support inputting text in the Internet and software companies shall make it default for their users.\nThis idea can be used in the applications that require a login for its use such as email, software, etc.\nThe new language can be used as a password for some applications that require login for its use, so the user will type faster using it in the applications that require a password and the password will be \"entered\" using this language. The user will no more need to type or copy-paste the password into the password field in password-based applications.\nAfter the user will download the new application which will have this feature and will test it, after that he will find a lot of new applications, applications which will need an online connection to work, will be created.\nAfter more users will find out about this new language and use it, these applications will become much more interesting because the user can work a lot faster and easier.\nThe user will receive better results after using this new language in applications that include data which are"

In addition, $h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}})$ is calculated by Eq.~\\ref{eq:H} in Section.~\\ref{sec:Hv}.\nThe overall likelihood function $L=\\prod_{i=1}^{N}L(h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}}))$ is then a summation of single mask $h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}})$ and can be formulated as\n\\begin{equation}\nL(h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}}))=\\left\\{\\begin{aligned}\np\\big(h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}})\\big) \\cdot h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}})\n\\quad\\big\\lvert\\big.\\,h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}}) = 1\\big\\rvert,\\\\\np\\big(h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}})\\big) \\cdot (1-h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}}) )\n\\qquad\\big\\lvert\\big.\\,h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}}) = 0\\big\\rvert.\n\\end{aligned}\\right.\n\\label{eq:Lhv}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAs mentioned previously, the human opinion dataset $H$ is a binary mask with 1 (green) and 0 (blue) denoting \\textit{correct} instances and \\textit{incorrect} instances. Therefore, a likelihood function $L$ can be viewed as a mask for instance segmentation prediction. The mask can be calculated from $H$ using the Eq.~\\ref{eq:Lhv}. As shown in $H$, the value of instance segmentation accuracy $A$ can be estimated more precisely in the range [0.0,1.0].\nWhen $h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}})$ takes a value of 1, then $L$ will be a mask with high density value, which means the corresponding instance segmentation classification is confident (Figs.~\\ref{fig:hv} and~\\ref{fig:dL}). When $h_{v}(x^{\\text{i}})$ takes a value of 0, then $L$ will be a mask with low density value, which indicates the corresponding instance segmentation classification is uncertain.\nTherefore, according to the human opinion $H$, the current predictive model can be updated by optimizing the network parameters $\\theta$ using a new mask $L$. The mask $L$ can be further normalized to a scalar value between -1 to 1.\n\n\\textbf{Improved Instance Segmentation Model}: The improved predictive model is then obtained by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{A}=&\\max_{\\theta} \\ L \\bigg(\\big\\langle(\\bm{\\varphi}^{(i)},h^{(i)})\\big\\rangle\\bigg)\n\\\\=&\\max_{\\theta} \\{\\underbrace{L(\\langle\\bm{\\varphi}^{(i)}, h^{(i)}\\rangle)}_{\\text{normalized}} \\},\n\\end{aligned}\n\\label{eq:norma}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figures/instance_image_cropped.pdf}\n\\caption{An instance segmentation confidence mask predicted from an annotated instance segmentation dataset: (a) is incorrect, (b) is correct.\n}\n\\label{fig:hv}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[style=TNR]{figures/d_L1_cropped.pdf}\n\\caption{The different instance segmentation confidence masks are predicted from an instance segmentation dataset: (a) is incorrect, (b) is correct; (c) the mask (0.77) obtained by human opinion $H$ (0.38, 0."

If you could help me write it i would be most grateful.\nThe most basic form of a strategic plan is a one-page document outlining objectives, strategies, resources and timelines.\nIn some cases, however, it is more appropriate to create a multi-page strategic plan -- outlining the same things, but in greater depth.\nIf you have more than 3 pages, you're most likely adding information that is best presented in more than one page. Consider breaking larger sections into their own attachments.\nThere are three components to a strategic plan: an overview, the goal the team needs to work toward, and the resources -- people, places, and things -- that must be in place for the goals to be achieved.\nThis document should outline the following: a summary paragraph of the vision/goal of the plan, the overall resources needed, and the team that will be involved. The plan should also clearly define who is responsible for each element of the plan; this may be done by listing each member of the team or by designating a different person as the owner of each element.\nInclude here what your mission and vision are, and state the primary goals the organization has. What do you want to accomplish? What do you want to be when you grow up?\nThis section takes a strategic look at the company's future. It helps the reader understand where the company is heading, what its priorities are, and its focus in the current year and beyond.\nThis should explain who you are, where your resources come from, the kind of work you do, and what you do to excel at what you do.\nTalk about this in the 5-year projection.\nIt's critical that when a strategic plan addresses a specific action item, every team member agrees to be accountable to that commitment. Accountability can be assigned to specific individuals or groups.\nIf a strategic plan fails to take each person's perspective into account, the plan can quickly derail. You can have an excellent plan in place, but if the people and the resources needed to execute that plan aren't aligned, the strategy will fail. To ensure a successful strategic plan, the team has to understand everyone's unique perspective -- including the people who are not in the room with you.\nOne of the basic elements of strategic planning is to be clear on the target: what exactly does it mean to \"succeed\" in the eyes of the team?\nBe as specific as possible, making sure to cover things such as: what specific financial figures do we want to work toward; what do we want to accomplish with new and existing services; and what do we want to say to customers about our value proposition.\nA clear vision is a critical element of an effective plan. A team may set one-year financial goals, but if the organization can't achieve them, there's no point in completing the plan.\nHow much do we want to grow/make/do?\nHow will the world change in order to make this possible?\nIf you have a budget, you'd better stick to it. If you don't have a budget, you should be willing to commit the resources required to execute the plan.\nWhen should the strategic plan be implemented?\nWhen should each element of the plan be completed?\nWhat resources will be spent for each project in the strategic plan? This is a key element of the financial projections that must be aligned with the team's desire for success.\nIt's very common for strateg"

I had to get rid of my car back in 1993. It needed repairs and I wasn’t going to pay for them. I knew that its resale value would be low as it was, in my eyes, of limited utilities. I also wanted to get a deal on the taxes for the vehicle. I decided to sell it to myself. The price was low and the car was of no value to me. I kept it for a while. It was a Volkswagen Rabbit and in a few days after the sale, I received a letter from the VW organization. It informed me about the resale value of the car and inquired what the value of my car was. I gave it the value I had sold it for and sent the letter. I never saw the car again. I received a check in exchange for the car and a year or so later, a friend of mine, the owner of a VW specialty shop, called in Boston to complain to me about a deal he had not done. He had heard from a customer that the stereo installed in my car was the best money could buy. How could that be? He had inquired, to no avail, as to who sold me the Rabbit. My wife and I had bought the car locally and I took it to his specialty shop for the installation of a much better sound system than the original one. He found out in the end that it was the VW specialists who had sold the car to me and that it was a different one. (Yes, I have a very low self-esteem.) The VW store sent me the stereo it had installed before. But it turned out that this stereo was no longer available. It took a lot of calling, but in the end VW installed a much better stereo for me (for a fee). The moral of the story is that if you want to make money at selling a car, you must do it in a few days. The car turns to be of little value to anybody as soon as somebody purchases it.\nThose who sell cars today use what I consider to be a very basic strategy, which I had occasion to use myself.

Also\nnoted is that all the wireless signals transmitted on the ground will be intercepted by the transmitter.\nThis means that other buildings, trees, vehicles, and other large sources of wireless radiation will be\nintercepted by the receiving antenna. As with any communication system, a large amount of signal\nwill be lost due to the large interference.\nThere are two ways to minimize the interference. The first method is to use antennas that are\ndirected to where it is needed most. These antennas can be as wide as the area that interference\ncomes from or only as far as can be extended away from that area. This will minimize the loss\nof signal but will still cause a large amount of interference. The other possible way to minimize the\ninterference is to adjust the direction of the antenna. This method will cause loss of some signal due\nto having the antenna oriented in the wrong direction but at the same time will increase the signal\ngain in the target region. Another disadvantage to this procedure lies in the need of reconfiguring\nthe antenna periodically due too interference. This method is only for systems that require a\nlarge amount of signal and need to be targeted to a small area.\nBoth of these system components are only the two ways to minimize interference but do not\nreduce the amount of interference received. Also noted in Fig. 1.6 is that there is an area where\nthe signal strength will be much lower than it would be with the ideal system which implies an unacceptable\nreduction in communication and a possible reduction in effectiveness of the system as a whole.\nFig. 5. Sysm and the interference of wires.\n1-8-1 WIRELESS SYSTEM ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES\nAdvantages and disadvantages of wireless systems are well summarized in Table\nWireless systems of transmission are advantageous because\nthey may be easily installed and reconfigured and require little room for installation. They allow\nflexibility which a hardwired system cannot.\nThey also allow for many additional features such as the possibility of releasing multiple\nfrequencies and multiple signals in the network. Although this may be beneficial to the network as\na whole, it can be harmful to those within the network and interfere with the wired network. They\nalso allow for a much longer usable life which is crucial when installing multiple wireless systems\nor using wireless networks that are far apart. The longer life of the network will reduce the amount\nof reconfigurations and expenditures for new nodes and links.\nAlthough wireless networks are versatile to install, they also have several disadvantages.\nThey usually do have a higher installation cost, and as mentioned earlier, their operation requires\nconsiderable expense over time. These components can be minimized as some wireless systems\ncan operate with power supplied by the signal to be sent or can operate at a reduced power\nsupply thus saving in expenses. Wireless transmissions are often not as fast as those of a\nhardwired system due mainly to the limited speed of the modulation schemes and signal power\nlevels. The transmission speed for wireless system can be further enhanced by introducing\nfrequencies with higher bandwidth to the network which can then be used for the data transmission.\nWireless systems also have a shorter range of operation when compared to a hardwired\nsystem due to the lower signal radiating power, and as seen earlier, the loss of signal between\nantennas is unavoidable due to the interference of other hardwares and antennas. In addition,\nthe presence of water, metals, conductors, and concrete will also degrade the signal performance\non a hardwired system. Since this is not the case with wireless systems, the range of operation\nwill increase substantially. As mentioned in subsection 1.3.2, the presence of walls or buildings\nalso affects how far the signal will propagate. With a wireless connection, however, this is not a\nproblem since there is no hardwired connection.\n1.9 SYSTEM LOAD\nThe system load of a wireless network is determined by the distance that the signals travel in\nspread spectrum modulation as shown in section 1.7. The distance that is measured is called\nthe Doppler spread of the system. This distance is shown as\nin the Fig. 1.6. As can be seen in the Fig. 1.6"

        "output": "Hi, I have a question about MFCC (mel frequency cepstral coefficients). Are they the same thing as a MEL-spectogram, or is there a difference? Thanks.\nGreg: They are somewhat related, but different. The Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are what you get when you compute a Fourier transform of a mel-spaced spectral cepstral vector.\nHowever, the mel-spaced spectral cepstra are simply a matrix that holds how the spectral energy is distributed across frequency within a mel scale, so there is actually nothing special about the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. They are just the first few entries (frequency domain) in the Fourier transform of this matrix, much like the first few entries represent the first few harmonics of sounds.\nTherefore, since there is nothing special about this representation, you should always try to do all your operations in the spectral domain whenever possible and this is why the Spectrogram would be used to create the mel-spaced spectral cepstra.\nTherefore the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, as a vector, are really a representation in the frequency domain of what the spectral cepstra looks like, much like a mel-spaced spectral cepstra is a representation of what the full spectrum looks like.\nThis is why the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and the mel-spaced spectral cepstras are similar, yet a little different.\nThere are some interesting results that come out because a mel-spaced spectral cepstra matrix isn't really a frequency domain representation. For instance, the frequency content of the mel-spaced spectral cepstras do not represent what the original signal's spectral content looks like. That's why you often get funny representations like the one you get from a mel-spectrogram because that's effectively the same thing as what the full spectrum looks like, but in the frequency domain. That's also why you can do other interesting operations on mel-spaced spectral cepstras for analysis, such as how to find the average magnitude and frequency in a mel-spaced spectral cepstra matrix."

        "output": "who was the black cabinet member who went on to play an important role in the civil rights movement when he was the Assistant Attorney General to Thurgood Marshall.\nHe brought the civil rights litigation to the court. And so with the help of his colleagues and later on with the help of people like his colleague Justice Marshall but also with Howard University, they would host all of these conferences. That’s exactly what was in mind. The goal in mind had to do with the idea to really educate these African American lawyers because the only access to the legal system was through the university law schools. It was up to Howard University to really make a point of saying, “Look, we’re going to send our students out to law school, we’re going to provide them with everything that they need because by 1964 what we need to do is to make sure they have a chance to succeed.” And so that’s what’s that’s where these conferences came from as an idea and an effort.\nLater on, and you’ll hear other stories about these kinds of conferences with the NAACP that’s, you know, for example, that’s where we got the Legal Defense Fund which was created by Thurgood Marshall and other civil rights lawyers coming out of law school. We got the NAACP through these conferences. So the conference that you see in the film is part of this ongoing tradition that really started at Howard University.\nEugene: So we talk about access, we talk about the need for access to education in general and specifically in this case to a legal system and a legal education. Would you talk a little bit about your film focus and its impact?\nJudge: We talk about access but we also talk about people who are willing to do the work that that access opens the door for. You know, if you have a university that doesn’t have a law school, well access is important. The access might be to a university or the access might be to a court. This is what Howard University became about. It went from a university of black people’s dream to an intellectual leader that produced lawyers who actually went on to lead a movement.\nWe have a civil rights act and one of the best examples of that is actually in the conference because President Kerr, right? He’s been president since the mid-40s when he was here. He is a professor of psychology. He’s been a professor of psychology his whole tenure as president. In 1961, it’s the time that he was a professor of psychology. But what he’s also the president of Howard. He also is the president of a university.\nAnd at that point, there is no Civil Rights Act. He’s trying to figure out how to talk to these lawyers about how to change civil rights law. He didn’t necessarily understand the history of civil rights policy. He wanted to bring in people who understood that history. This is the president of the university. He invites these people because they’re the best among us. You know, they were the best law students of their class at various law schools.\nEugene: He’s inviting the best and brightest to come to Howard and that starts a movement to make legislative change.\nJudge: Yeah. I think sometimes we forget but you know, the work the legal professionals have done to change civil rights law is enormous and the work they did in the 1950s as part of the Brown case is that in the 1950s they brought in these lawyers to teach these law professors at Harvard and other law universities how to argue for the NAACP’s position that segregation was wrong. You know, it was something that the lawyers of the day just couldn’t quite see through the legal system. What would happen if we start allowing for, you know, equal access to things that people of color weren’t allowed to do before?\nEugene: So we’ve seen that a number of ways in terms of legislative policy and judicial policy through access to education and access to legal education, access to justice, that’s the next question. In this film, obviously, you’re asking a question about access to justice. For me as a lawyer who really cares about that, access is really the big deal. And we talk about it in terms of diversity, we talk about it in terms of equity, but at its core, it’s about fairness.\nFor example, in the film there’s a couple of examples about how certain lawyers had more latitude in how they handled certain cases than other lawyers. One of those examples is a case about a"

What is the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters? You'll also need to know how to use the decimal multiplication and division symbols to change decimals into a suitable form when doing the problem. Let's get started! To figure out the percentage that is made in each quarter, we take the number of times each ratio appears, which is: R1: 21%, R2: 92%, R3: 81%, R4: 90%. Then, we take the product of these numbers, which is: (90%*21%) + (92%*81%) + (81%*88%) + (88%*90%). (90%*21%) + (92%*81%) + (81%*88%) + (88%*90%) = ((90*21 + 92*81 + 81*88 + 88*90)/100)*100 = (74/100 + 75/100 + 71/100 + 80/100)*100 = 93/100*100 = 930% You'll want to remember that this percentage works out to be: total profit over the course of a quarter: 90/100, total profit over the course of half a year: 90%, total profit over the course of full year: 900% You can see that the total profit percentage is indeed: 100% - 80% = 175/100 = 17.5% You can remember this as: 100 - amount to sell: 20; remaining is profit: 80%."

Okay, I might call myself a control freak.)\nSo I'll give the mouse a tuna sandwich instead. Maybe a handful of crisp lettuce leaves.

We know that sugar and all the things that make cookies have effects on our health. But so many parents and children think that sweets are ok. That is not right. Parents need to wake up. It may be cute and funny to read. But if these stories get repeated over and over again. It will have effects on our children.\nHow did the mouse get the cookie?\nI'm not sure if anyone will answer this question but, how did the mouse get the cookie?\nHow did he find the house?\nAnd how did the cookie find him?\nAnswered by Cora 15 months ago\nWell, the book doesn't specifically say, but it appears that he entered the house from the back door, which had been left open. And, I suspect that a mouse (or small child, for that matter) would be able to snatch a cookie from an open plate. As far as the mouse's finding the house, I think his instincts told him to go there looking for food (or shelter); or, maybe he just took a wrong turn.\nThat doesn't really answer my question but thanks anyways.\nI was about to offer the same answer about that back door being left open but the book never mentions it. I did wonder about it though.\nCrystal, you are correct. I'll make a note to update my answer to help with the confusion. Thanks for bringing that to my attention.\nAnswered by JBonding 15 months ago\nHey Linda--I can see your point: It's certainly not what I'm trying to do is advocate the giving of all cookies to all mice (or adults, or children or anything else.) I just thought this was an amusing story and I'm curious about the origin of the line. I'm guessing it started out as a joke about a really bad idea that no one should consider. But the story just doesn't make sense without it.\nI do agree with your main point: I think we could and should do more to teach our children about healthy eating. And I know that it's a lot easier for parents to buy and sell caffeine soda pops and chips in vending machines and 7-11's than it is for them to sell fresh air and sunshine. It's a problem. But I digress...\nAnswered by Crystal 15 months ago\nThat is true. But when the child get to be older they are thinking why they got to do their. Maybe they need to do it in the morning or in the evening or they need to eat healthy like you said.\nAnd this book is about how the cookie found the mouse.\nThis story is based on the old saying: \"If you give a mouse a cookie, he'll ask for a glass of milk\". It has nothing to do with healthy eating, except that maybe if you give your children tons of cookies and milk, they'll be too drowsy to run around until they're fat instead.\nAnd I agree Crystal, you're also right. Parents do what they can to give their children everything. So I can definitely understand where you're coming from.\nIn my opinion, I'm not sure how the mouse got the cookie. I'm thinking the backdoor was left open and the mice just walked right in. That's my opinion!\nI think his instinct told him to eat. Also, his hunger got the best of him. He needed to eat and that's all it came down to.\nAnswered by LJJohnson 15 months ago\nThat was a really funny book but the line always confused me when I read it. How did the mouse get the cookie?\nI think this might be a question the writer might not have answered himself or herself. It's not a great book but in my opinion it's a cool children story.\nAnswered by Tracy 15 months ago\nSo I'm guessing"

No, it isn't. And if it is the gospel we have to worry about, isn't it our eternal soul at stake, isn't it our salvation that we have to worry about?

Why?\nHas travel influenced the way I take photos? Why?\nIs there a particular time period I like to photography or a particular scene, culture, or subject matter I'm drawn to?\nWhy do I take photos?\nHas a particular book by a famous photographer or writer inspired or influenced my writing? Why?\nWho is my favorite photographer and why?\nAnother place to start is browsing through your photos. Have you been able to accomplish something you were really proud of? Did that accomplishment influence how you felt, helped your confidence, made you proud of what you could achieve?\nHas technology influenced your photography? Why? How?\nI love the above question. Have so many technological breakthroughs made it easier to be creative or do we overuse these new ways of creating and sharing images? What is the future (as in 10 or 15 years) for camera technology?\nIf possible, include a section for a friend or relative to fill out. It's one thing to describe yourself, but it is usually more helpful to hear from others how they see us.\nUse this part as an opportunity to highlight how your photography has changed your life or inspired others, friends, family, co-workers, or acquaintances, etc.\nI had fun recently while writing my statement. It made me look back at photos and my photography history and it made me feel great about what I've done. So I encourage everyone interested in applying to do the same.\nIf you want more inspiration or someone to bounce ideas off of, try taking a photography class or find yourself a trusted friend/colleague who knows you well and is also a photographer.\nYou don't have to do this alone, nor should you feel that you have to, but having someone to bounce ideas with and talk with can really help you figure out what you want to say.\nTake your time with it.\nWhat if your statement doesn't win the award?\nWell, as my friend, fellow photographer, and fellow AAF member (hey Dave!) says, \"It's not a popularity contest, it's not a popularity contest, it's not a popularity contest, so stop worrying about popularity.\"\nBut seriously. If you do win, great. If not, the award panel has already seen the quality of your photography and written statements, and may see your work as a finalist in another award category or simply at the top of the list of your peers. Don't let a loss bring you down.\nAlso, know that many professional photographers don't win first place, so you are in very good company. You can view the 2009 Gold and Silver Award Winners here, but also know that many of the 107 Gold Medalists didn't win the Grand Award. And that many, many more didn't win any of the 37 awards given in their respective categories.\nTake the time with your statement and make sure you have a good argument on why you deserve the award and what you have accomplished in your career.\nMake an argument, don't ask for an award. After all, you won't get it if you don't ask, right?\nWhat's the next step after you have finished?\nI'll discuss this next week, so tune in soon and check out what I have for you Monday and Thursday, as my next two weekly segments will be about writing your statement for an award application.\nUntil next week, happy writing!"

What is certain is that no country’s national laws on this matter can contradict the 2004/37/EC Framework Directive.\nI have looked for the official web page describing the Framework Directive on working time. It says it’s been put out of action by a “temporary” directive.\nI’ve seen it suggested that the 2004/37/EC Framework Directive be “corrected” to allow for changes introduced by the 2006/88 EU Directive.

I seem to remember the Renault Megane was one of them.\nIf the Megane was included, I guess all other low MPG cars with emission control systems (all modern cars) which have emission controls (I do not think this is an exageration) would be included also. However, many of these cars are made outside the EU.\nPosted in Uncategorized | Comments Off on The 30MPG rule as introduced\nBritish drivers are dumber than Swiss drivers\nI have mentioned before the 1998 study by the AA, of car crashes in Europe, for UK, French and German roads.\nThe study showed that French drivers were twice as likely as UK drivers to be involved in a crash, and that Germans were twice as likely as UK drivers to cause an accident.\nI can only conclude that the study was flawed. There may have been a cultural bias against UK drivers to account for their lower accident rate and against German drivers to account for their lower accident causing rate.\nIn the French case the data seems to show a greater prevalence of alcohol, of drug, and smoking in the population than in the UK population, but this can only partially account for the lower French crash rate.\nIn the German case the data seems to show a lower level of unemployment, an older population, but this can only partially account for the lower German crash causing rate.\nThe UK has very few non-fatal accidents on the road but it has a high rate of death and injury (per km driven or per accident) because of the high number of non-fatal accidents.\nThe French have very few non-fatal accidents and a very high rate of death and injury because of the low number of non-fatal accidents.\nThe Germans have very few non-fatal accidents because they are such safe drivers, and a very high rate of death and injury because every single non-fatal accident, even non-injury accidents"

I'm looking for this step by step - I'm sure others are wondering the same thing.\n2) Why did you sell the stock?\n3) How can you now say that your money is gone? Stock prices still trade. What you sold were merely rights to your stock at some point in the future (which is why the stock market sometimes seems like a casino). If you sold at a loss, which may or may not be permanent, you incurred a capital loss. This loss has implications on your tax return depending on whether or not the stock was a capital asset. It also implicates a wash sale loss (more on this later). Since this is likely the main reason for the sale, it's important to understand the tax consequences.\n4) If you need the cash to maintain a specified minimum balance in a financial account (think credit card debts, car payments, college, etc). These are called \"financial needs\" which differ from \"personal goals\" in that your finances should provide enough to pay the bills but your life should provide enough to pay the debts. The two should align, never diverge.\nAgain, this may help get some others interested as well.\nThank you for the help, it has been very helpful!\nYou got both of them, it means it is on, and when you click on it that is the marketplace you will now able to buy and sell stocks now from the homepage.\nSo now it will look like this..\nYou're welcome.

First diagnosed in early 2007 at age 30. Initially put on a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a Calcium Channel Blocker. I stopped the Calcium Channel Blocker due to an allergic reaction, however stayed on the ACE Inhibitor to treat and control Blood Pressure. When the HBP worsened the dosage of the ACE INHIBITOR was increased twice over the course of nearly 13 years. Unfortunately, the doctor I was with over a period of about 10 years no longer was my doctor and so was passed onto another doctor. The medication was continued and when the BP readings were still not coming below 150/90. I was put onto two other medications: an Amlodipine/Valsalvin/Felodipine (SPANULA) 10mg 2.5mg and 5mg which is taken once in the morning. I was also put on Lisinopril (Zestri), a diuretic taken once in the morning. My current GP decided that we should take another BP readings and discovered that the readings were still out the acceptable range. She then put me onto another two medications: An Amlodipine/Valsalvin/Felodipine (SPANULA) 5mg twice daily as well as an Eplerenone 50mcg taken once in the morning as well. My readings at first improved and the doctor was very happy, however when i checked the readings again my BP was still too high. My doctor then decided that to treat HBP I should be put onto a combination of a Diuretic (Furosemide), an Amlodipine/Valsalvin/Felodipine (SPANULA) 5mg twice daily and again Telmisartan 40mg (Acebradium). The Diuretic was initially prescribed as a trial dose which was only supposed to last a few days but when my doctor took a BP reading it came below the acceptable BP range. The Diuretic dose (Furosemide) is now 20mg twice daily to control my HBP. My question however is, what do you think the best way to treat HBP is? Should I increase the dose of the SPANULA? Should I be put onto a different Diuretic? Should I be put onto insulin injections and Metformin? Please i really need help on this. Any advice or pointers would be very much appreciated. Thank you kindly.\nAnswer: It is normal to have difficulty controlling high blood pressure with medicines. In you case, I would recommend that a healthy lifestyle is the best medicine to control high blood pressure. For this, you should follow below recommendations:\nThe recommended amount of aerobic exercises is 150 minutes per week\nWeight loss if you are overweight\n"

        "output": "What if people only valued and took pride in the things that were true about themselves? What if we were to look at those things that are false about ourselves as a reflection of others, and not as a true reflection of ourselves? I think that, in and of itself, that could do wonders for what is deemed worthy, and not worthy. What it does for the self-esteem of those who do well at those things which are deemed as being worthy, and how that might affect them personally.\nHow should society view someone when they're being told something other than the truth? I wonder if the world would view it differently, and that that, in itself, would make a huge difference to who we think we are, as well as giving us some kind of perspective on where we are with what we think we know. In other words, should we trust others, or have we just been giving information that has been passed on from another.\nDo we really know something? Or have we just been taught from someone who's been taught from someone else. And does it really have to be that way? Do we really have to be taught, and re-taught, by other people in society?\nAnd what if, we are, in fact, born with the truth of who we are. That we know what we have, and the only need is to develop it, and let it flourish. We are born with a gift. Should we not, then, trust ourselves, and let go. Should we not, then, be able to do something else, and not be limited by the things that, maybe, we think we can't do?\nDoes it really have to be something that is defined in any way? Does it have to be anything that we know. Or how about something that we don't even know, can't even comprehend? Does that even make sense?\nIn other words, if we find out, after it develops, that we have something that is truly unique, and only comes out in a particular situation. And that, we are then told that we cannot share it in the outside world. That we have to keep quiet about it. Do we believe it? Or are we, then, limited by society, and told that it is not, in fact, okay to be ourselves?\nI personally think that, we should look to ourselves that, we can trust ourselves. We should, therefore, look at who we are, and understand who we are.\nI have often done, things, in life, because I have always had a gut feeling about something particular. At the same time, I have often heard from others that there is no point in trusting my intuition because people never follow me in anyway, and they don't see it. I have been told this because they don't know that it is intuition I am talking about.\nMy intuition sometimes comes up with things like, they tell me that I have a dream. In that dream they can be anything from my sister, or someone from history. Or they can just be a figure that stands in my way and tells me to leave, even though we live in the same house. Or they can just be someone who has some control from the outside world, like my bank manager, and, at most, it's just a few words, or not anything at all, and it could all be my own imagination. Maybe, at the beginning, I was just playing around with my mind. But, in most cases, I have always been correct, and found out later, when I have actually gone to do something about it in the outside world, that it has turned around, and a lot has happened.\nFor my gut feeling to sometimes be not the truth, in which case it was my imagination, it was actually one of those dreams which have been forgotten, even though their purpose has been fulfilled. Other times, it has just been a bad dream where my brother died, and I have woken up, and cried, and he has been fine. Which has turned around, and found out later that he in fact was just fine.\nIs it my intuition that has let me down, or do we judge ourselves if we do not follow what is intuition.\nDoes life have an end?\nI have always asked, life, how much further do you have to go. For me, no end. For example, with my daughter, I have always found it a little hard to put my finger where life has ended and a new phase begins. How does she change? It's very scary. I would love to know where life has ended, and, where, she has gone.\nI think, life is just as natural as going into a dream state. There is a dream state, but it has a very clear start and a very clear end, and that's it. I wonder if, life"

        "instruction": "Why does warmth make you feel tired?",
        "output": "Why does warmth make you feel tired? Does fatigue happen in colder or warmer climates? And most importantly of all, how does it happen?\nThe simple answer is the way your body works. Your body is like a car, and energy is like petrol. When you go for a run, you’ll use up petrol (or energy) to make your muscles move, creating the work you can see when you look at yourself.\nIf you run the same distance over and over again, you get better at running that distance. You can run longer distances and faster, with less effort. Now remember these were all distances, so the petrol was pretty much the same, but you used that petrol faster. You used more of it but less of it in that timeframe, hence the tired feeling. You’re like a diesel-engine car going uphill – your petrol-engine car might be able to get up the hill better with better uphill gears, but ultimately diesel engines will use more fuel, but go faster and further, with less overall energy.\nThis same principle applies when the temperature is colder or warmer. You might be exercising on a ski slope, or a hill that makes it a real struggle to move your legs and up your pole or skate, but you feel fresh, not tired. It’s because there is more oxygen in the air, so there’s more petrol, or energy available, so you use up more petrol to cover the same distance. The same applies to warm weather exercise – the warmer you are, the faster your body will use up energy, so there’s less petrol used and you feel fatigued.\nWhen you’re cold, your muscles are less efficient. When the air is colder, you’re getting less oxygen in each breath you take, and you can’t push down as well because your muscles are colder than you’d expect. A colder body uses more of your energy to get warm and to keep warm.\nWhich is why the people in Antarctica are constantly covered in woolly jumpers. They’ve all got one on, and they live next to a heater that never ever turns off.\nBut when you exercise in warm weather, you use up your energy quicker. And that heat that you produce when you exercise is mostly heat from your muscles, so as they get hotter, they can’t work as efficiently as they can when they’re at a lower temperature, so it takes longer to finish one session of exercise and get better at it.\nSo which is nicer, to exercise in cold, cold weather or hot, hot weather? Well, it depends. Which do you like less? Or is it neither? For me, I find that I hate both types of weather, but I have to choose. I guess I actually quite like cold weather, but I’d rather avoid it if I can.\nBut a lot of people don’t like the cold, or the wet, or the wind. So if they can find a warm climate, or a climate with less variables, where they can exercise, and they can do it comfortably, then that’s better than nothing.\nSo the quick summary is this:\nThere is a lot more oxygen when the air is warmer.\nYou use petrol (energy) quicker when it’s warmer.\nYou’ll feel more tired when the air is warm.\nThis is the first step in understanding how your body responds to temperature and what makes it feel tired. If you want to know exactly why, subscribe to my blog via the pop-up box on the right. I’ll send you my whole book straight to your inbox and you’ll be able to delve deeper.\nI hope this has helped you understand why we feel this way. It will explain that feeling of tiredness after exercise, and why your muscles ache all the time. It will help your body recover faster from exercise, and it will help your body stay fitter over the whole year so you can have a more consistent level of fitness all year around.\nHow to Beat The Winter Blues – The Effects of Temperature on the Body and How to Help Yourself"

It is there, but I haven’t seen it, I know it is there. I just haven’t yet noticed it, I have a problem (unlike most people) with not seeing the obvious. You see things when you look for them…\nThis reminds me in many ways of Buddhist concepts of Emptiness and Dependent Origination. Emptiness: there is no inherent nature of any thing, no ‘thing-ness’, no essence, no independent reality, no substantiality. All things are dependent upon causes and conditions to come into being, for emptiness is the void-like nature of all things. Nothing has solidity, we just think it is solid because we are habituated to take that for granted, when in truth it has no ‘thing-ness’ at all. Really, it is nothing but emptiness.\nEmptiness is the way\nYou know, you don’t necessarily need a teacher, you can read the books alone. And, this is a good thing, because we live in challenging times, the world is so very confusing, and you will certainly have many doubts. Doubt is an important spiritual practice, in my case. Doubt always reminds me that I do not know. Acknowledging my ignorance is a good thing. With that knowledge comes humility. I have no idea. I am completely ignorant, I am without knowledge. It is so amazing. Life is truly incomprehensible (incomprehensible means unable to comprehend).\nAnd…the first step…\nAnd that, my friends (and I suppose my few readers will appreciate this) is an example of Dependent Origination. The first step is noticing that there is no inherent nature to anything. But if I don’t recognize that there is no inherent nature, no essence, then nothing happens, it just stays the same. If we don’t notice that there is no inherent nature of anything, then nothing changes, nothing happens. Notice, see the obvious, see the thing; that there is no inherent nature. Empty, without inherent nature, and then see all things as empty, everything is dependent upon causes and conditions.\nSeeing things differently has a transformative effect, an enlivening effect. See things how they are, and they will transform.\nEmptiness is the way of enlightenment; it is how the ‘teacher’ appears, and how all things appear. All things are unfixed and dependently arisen. All things are empty.\nNow the answer to the little question…\nWhere is the apple?\nIt depends if I want an apple… If I don’t but I can have one for a few dollars, I would get it. If not I don’t need it, so I don’t.\nThere is a story of someone asking a monk:\nWhat if one was in search of a piece of the truth?\nThe monk:\nThen he would find it,\nAnd if he wanted it on a platter?\nThat would be even easier…\nI just noticed that I have left out a key concept of Dependent Origination, and it is this:\nA cause always requires a condition to arise. Every condition is the cause for that condition. If the causes are removed, so is the condition.\nIf there were no conditions, then there would be no causes, no conditions, no arising. But everything has conditions (or causes) of arising, everything.\nSo, the problem is this:\nI do not see that things depend upon conditions for their arising.\nThe solution to this problem is to see that everything depends upon causes and conditions for its arising, that nothing arises on its own…\nLabels: Buddhism, Dependent Origination, Emptiness"

The Importance of Marketing to the Financial Services Industry Executive Summary Financial services can be viewed as a commodity good or a “service.” A commodity good is something with little or no differences in an individual. The financial services industry has an image problem. Consumers perceive financial institutions as faceless organizations, only focused on meeting their minimum regulatory requirements and protecting them from legal liability. One way to alleviate this image problem is to create a unique identity that sets you apart from the competition and develops a loyal customer base. The goal of this assignment is to examine how to create a marketing plan that sets apart the institution while simultaneously developing a market presence and building the institutionâ€™s brand recognition, which will be achieved by introducing a new line of financial services. Marketing is the process of creating interest in a product and turning that interest into buying customers (Litowich, 1997). It allows a company to meet the needs of its customers. Marketing should be in a constant state of development so that it continues to meet current customer needs and expectations and that it anticipates and meets changes in customerâ€™s needs and trends on a continual basis. One must not forget that customers donâ€™t care how much you know until they know how much you care. To effectively launch your...\nFederal government of Pakistan Essay"

        "instruction": "when are hops added to the brewing process?",
        "output": "when are hops added to the brewing process?\nJoe Tingley: Often when we want to do an IPA we’ll do a small test batch that we call a pilot batch. Then when we’re ready to come out with the beer, once we know what the style is, then we know how hoppy it is and we can see whether we want to use crystal or wheat sugar to balance it out. If the beer is really hoppy but we’ve added crystal malt to give it a fuller texture, we’d have to use a lot of hop bitterness to balance it out. It could be that the beer is going to taste nice, but when we are looking at the cost per barrel, it’s going to be quite expensive. So, using wheat sugar then we can add less bittering hops to balance out to get the bitter flavour in the beer as well, while also keeping the price of the beer low. So, you have to balance out the costs and the flavour profile, and the bitterness. Then there are other things as well. Crystal malt adds another level of complexity if you get a lot of caramel flavour, for example. So you have to balance those two things together – flavour, and then cost and bitterness. The process is constantly adjusting so you can get the balance just right.\nFMB: A brewery often has a certain style, or house style, that they’re trying to achieve. How does this affect the process of hop selection?\nJT: As we have a defined style – we like to see a nice sweetness, bitterness and flavour – we can try to look at hops that are complementary and enhance the flavour and aroma that we’re already getting from crystal malt or wheat sugar. And it’s also all about getting the balance right. I’ve worked breweries that have had a style and if you don’t have that style on the brew day, then it throws everything out of kilter. One hop could completely change the balance.\nFMB: Is the whole process very scientific or creative?\nJT: It’s both. A lot of my role is very creative. When you’re trying to get that balanced sweetness and bitterness, it’s a lot of creativity and a lot of trial and error. If you just want to follow an IPA recipe, you can end up with a very dull or bland beer, and you want to lift it or create that complexity that you get with hops. With the creativity part, I’m quite fortunate that we’ve got really good brewers here at Penguin, who’ll come to me and say, ‘what do you think of this recipe?’ and I’ll have ideas. It’s great working with them, they’re very open-minded. They might ask for my opinion on something that they’ve already come up with. It’s a bit of a team effort.\nFMB: For new brewers looking to develop a house style, how do they find the right types of hops, given the hundreds of different varieties available?\nJT: There’s a lot of support and discussion among brewers that make the beers and they’ll give you advice. They’ll say, ‘this hop works well, this is a really good hop for a certain flavour’. There’s a lot of discussion with other brewers in the industry. But there’s also a lot of information online about varieties and how they taste, what aromas they have, what flavours they have, and how they affect the taste of your beer. A lot of brewers spend a lot of time on the Internet doing research about hops.\nFMB: Why does New Zealand seem to be doing really well with craft beer?\nJT: We are quite fortunate with the weather, we get good airflow. I guess back in Europe, where the micro-brewing industry is still quite new, they’d be in industrial buildings, so there wouldn’t be the air circulation inside the building. Being in an industrial building doesn’t take the temperature inside it down, so it’s more like boiling hot in summer. So, there’s less flexibility to dry hop and play with aromas when you’ve got your own building. They can still do everything, but it’s perhaps not as creative as we’re able to be. But I guess it really is about the beer for us. We’re lucky enough to get really nice weather, and that’s certainly helped us to develop this industry."

What are the other things when you talk about game design, the thing about, we talked a lot about rules systems, but, what about the rest of the game? Where’s the character development? We talk a lot about those things, and that’s why in our, our curriculum, as well in the book, we talk about that, but, let’s give you a little hint about how to write a, good, character development story. So we write stories all the time but not all the time is it the character developing his story with a goal in mind and as we write these stories, they’re not just for fun, if we’re working on them as a group and everyone takes part, everybody has to have, a sense of, what’s the goal, what’s the story, then when you all write the story, write this story together, but, what happens? Is a, lot of people jump in and, start to write in their, characters and, they, are, very, very, very, difficult, because, they, all, they, don’t, do this, at all, and, they try to take over the story and do what they want to do and that’s, so, not, what we should be doing, a character should be driven with a goal and, with, a, story and, the same thing, goes for the story, so, when you’re working on writing the story, everybody should have input, when, you’re going to write, this story, write it together, because, a, lot, of, the people in, the group, don’t know what, their, characters are really going to do, until they know what the goal is, for them to write, their, story, but, when you, are, working together, you, have to, find out, who’s, what, what’s, what, that that character’s going to do, is he going to be a, detective, is he someone that’s going to be a good, character for the group to write a good story, and he needs a good story to write is that good? A good. A good story is that good, but, a lot of people, they don’t want, to, write, what, someone, else, wrote, and a lot of the time, they never even read it, so, a lot of people, when they read it, I don’t know if I want to write this thing, or, I, just, got in there, and started, to, write it, because, I’m just not too excited"

Your ideas are always, creative, and the TikTok audience loves them.\nWrite a viral TikTok video based on Batik Tradjumas.\nTopic: Batik Tradjumas on TikTok, the fastest growing social videos app.\nWhat if we combine traditional clothes with modern style, but we can’t do it?\nWhat if we want to look pretty yet comfortable?\nWhat if we don’t even want to try?\nThese are the ideas of Batik Tradjumas videos on TikTok.\nYou will find the viral TikTok ideas on TikTok ideas page. But I can promise you, there is no viral Batik Tradjumas TikTok video idea from my side.\nBatik Tradjumas is a traditional TikTok dance made by Indonesian teens.\nIt’s easy to search Batik Tradjumas TikTok videos on TikTok app.\nYou can see the viral TikTok ideas there, and I’m not going to write it here, because you have already found it.\nSo let’s start writing a viral TikTok Idea based on Batik Tradjumas!\nIf you go to your TikTok account, click on the camera button and begin filming. And if you use a phone with TikTok app as default, you can access the TikTok camera easily. But if you want to do this in another app, you have to find it. That’s why we choose to write this viral TikTok idea in Microsoft Word.\nCreate the Batik Tradjumas TikTok video with your camera.\nThen we have some important parts that you have to add in the video.\nFirst, we start writing the title. But it’s not the kind of title that contains 2 words max. Instead, it consists 10 words, the longest TikTok title!\nBatik, Indonesia, Traditional, Dances, Trik, Ini, TikTok, Video, Indonesia, Traditional.\nTo make the Batik Tradjumas TikTok video popular, we have to know one thing, the Indonesian people are the main audience for the Batik Tradjumas TikTok videos.\nThey are very receptive to it due to their traditional tastes.\nSo we choose to make a video that focuses on their cultures, especially about the clothes, the way of life, the food.\nIf you are an Indonesian teen, you will see how much popular and trending the Batik Tradjumas TikTok video is.\nThe second thing that we should consider here is how to increase retention. We have to increase how long the TikTok audience watches our video. If we give them a new video every day, there is a possibility that they won’t watch. It’s really boring and irritating.\nNow, our video length reaches the magic number, 60-seconds (1 minute). That means we have the best opportunity to gain a lot of retention as possible.\nThe third thing is that an audience will be less annoying if they watch the viral Batik Tradjumas TikTok video frequently, such as a new video on each day.\nNow, there are 100-million users who use TikTok on their mobile phone. This huge user number means that you can use TikTok as a platform to build your online presence. You also have to do is create the high-quality TikTok videos that reach users worldwide.\nYou can watch more Tiktok videos here.\nAt the beginning of our batik tradjumas Tiktok video, we put the title on the screen. And when readers read the title, they will understand about the story directly. We will provide subtitles to help the audience understand more clearly. I’m sure you are tired of seeing many batik tradjumas Tiktok videos with the title, #batiktadjumas, #batiktradjumas #batiktradjumastiktok. For these batik tradjumas Tiktok videos, you can guess their stories.\nThe video goes to the second part when you use the green screen for about 15 seconds.\nWe will also add captions to the video in Indonesian language to increase the number of views. This is because TikTok is mainly used in Indonesia. The video caption consists of "

Not only that but you need some way to add people to that list.\nSo if you have an offer that you can sell to your list, I’ve put together this guide to building the foundation of your next successful online marketing business. I’ve laid out the steps you need to take to ensure the most success.\nWhether it be for your own business, or you want to provide this service to your customers, you need to find a good offer to sell (more on how to find one of those below).\nWe’ll cover how to research the market and make sure there’s a demand before diving into the tech.\nYou’ll need to have a lead gen page (this is where visitors leave their email address).\nAnd you’ll also need to have an autoresponder (so you can follow up with emails).\nI’ve included a few options in each category and some tips for pricing your service.\nThere are plenty of things to consider, from what technology to use to the best pricing strategies. We’re going to cover them all as we go through the steps.\nThere’s no need to dive in right now; you can read the whole guide above and come back to each step anytime.\nAt the end of this guide we’ve also included the best tools to build your email marketing service for WordPress, just in case you want to dive right in and see all of the options available.\nYou’re at the point in your business where you want to make money doing something you know how to do.\nIt might be anything from web design to social media management to email marketing.\nYou want to take the lessons that you have learned in whatever field you know and make money doing it.\nYou’ve probably already tried offering your service to friends and family or even as a hobby, but you don’t have the experience and the track record to do that to your entire customer base.\nYou want the freedom to do other things, be at home more frequently and spend more time away from your computers. In a way, maybe you’ve been so dedicated to working on your business that you didn’t really think about your life.\nThe time and the effort to build a business can only work for you if you get the right customers.\nWhich means that you have to find a marketing strategy that works to get the attention of your market.\nThe first step in building a successful marketing strategy is to figure out how many leads you really need to get. Do you need one person a day? Several a week? What other resources do you have to work with to find those leads? A network of contacts? Your website? A paid advertising effort? All of these things factor into your lead generation and how many leads you really need.\nMost businesses, particularly those that are new, will need to invest in some kind of paid advertising to be able to build up a lead list. Facebook for example, is great in that it allows you to target people very specifically, but, as I mentioned above, most will start to see a paywall once you get past free ads.\nIf you can pay that cost initially in order to grow your list (and have a way to continue to pay it) you will almost assuredly end up with more leads per dollar spent if you decide to do email marketing or any other kind of marketing to that list.\nAsking friends, family, colleagues and anyone else in your network is going to be a great idea, as long as you make sure they know you’re looking for leads that you can sell a product or service to. If you can reach a thousand people with a Facebook post for example, the cost would be less than the cost to generate a single lead through Facebook.\nOne of the most important things I’ve learned as a marketer in almost 2 decades in the business is that you should only create an email list if you’re going to be using it to bring the audience to a product.\nMost people want to start collecting emails just because they think it’s the best way to market to a prospect (and it is), but the truth is you’d be better off to use Facebook instead.\nFacebook is better because it has a higher number of contacts for the same price. When you build that email list you’ll have to pay $70+ per month (at least) to be able to send a campaign or sales letter.\nEmail also has a lot more limits than Facebook.\nAn email list can only be used once: someone signed up for your list yesterday, so only one email at a time (and the"

What are some of the best backlink strategies?\"\nWhich factors to consider to create backlinks successfully\nThis strategy focuses on getting good backlinks from websites that already have a good ranking in the SERPs. You can do this by sending a request to the webmaster to link back to your website.\nThis backlink strategy is not the easiest one to perform, but it is far more effective than the first one. You can also do this by commenting on popular websites and participating in discussions by adding your URL.\nThis is one of the best strategies for creating good backlinks. It works when you add high-quality content on your website and other resources related to your services or products. This is one of the most important strategies to implement for creating a good backlink. The reason for this is that other websites will also want to link back to your website.\n4. Guest Postings and Write For Others Strategy\nThis backlink strategy is very useful for increasing the number of high-quality backlinks to your website. The idea is to share your content with other sites to get your backlinks indexed by other search engines. For this, you need to write articles and post your website to other sites to get your backlink.\n5. High Page Rank Strategy\nThis strategy is a little more difficult, but it is very useful for creating backlinks. The idea is to select the top search engines and find websites that are already ranked high in these search engines. You can then select the websites that are ranked high in the search and build quality links.\n6. Link Exchange Strategy\nLink exchange backlinks means exchanging links with other websites. Like writing an article on one web site and posting the article on another site. The link exchange strategy is very effective, and you have to work hard to get a good result.\n7. Blog Posting Strategy\nBlog posting is one of the easiest ways to start getting high-quality backlinks to your website. If you do not have knowledge, you can leave this job to websites like Buyerhut, that help to post content on a regular basis on various sites.\n8. Article Submission Strategy\nThis strategy helps when you sign up for article directories, where you submit an article on your website. When a user submits an article to an article directory, the backlink may be placed on the article.

        "output": "is queue an ADT or a data structure, just something that stores all of the different objects that need to be processed, and you have a consumer that receives things from the queue that processes them.\nThere's a lot that I could say about the algorithms here, but we have this ADT, or the data structure, that holds all of our items to be processed. We'll call this itemQueue in the code for this video. ItemQueue is a queue, or a priority queue.\nThe reason we'll use a priority queue is, let's say I know that some of these pieces are supposed to have a higher priority than others. I might put that into an array called priority, and priority[i] is the priority of item i.\nA priority queue keeps track of when is the last time an item has been accessed. That's why I have itemQueue[i], the access time of item i. If I have itemQueue[i].lastAccessTime, then if I have an item that has not been accessed before, its access time is infinite. If it has been used before, its access time is the time that it was last used. This is an important thing for priority queues.\nWe have an array called priority. We have priority on the itemQueue object.\nIn the code for this video, the way the priority queue works is this. I'm going to be accessing this on line 15. We're going to be building a graph on line 12, and I'm going to use this on line 56.\nThis will work like a priority queue.\nHere's my access function. This is a method that I have defined on my graph item, or whatever I'm using as an ADT, but basically what I do is I check the priority, see what it is, and check to see if the priority has been used before.\nI don't care about the actual priority of the item. I just know that based on the fact that this has been accessed before or not, I know whether I have something important here or not. I'll just check whether it's been accessed before and if it has the priority is just the value that I stored on line 56.\nOn line 15, I'm initializing my data structure, so I'm going to set up all of my nodes, my directed graph here, like so.\nI know the priority is going to be zero, and I know that the lastAccessTime is infinity, because I just initialized it to that, and I'm going to return false, so no, this isn't going to work right away if I initialize this with an array of 10 nodes.\nI want this to function by only having one node here, and so to do that, I'm going to make this array null on the first access, and that's how this function is going to behave, and I'm going to access this on line 56 so that it does all its initialization.\nI'm then going to build my graph on line 12 and I'm going to build it incrementally so I just use this.addNeighbor function here on line 12. Just every time I pass this graph, I'll put in the next neighbor. That's how this incremental graph build works.\nIf I didn't have a queue here, this would all work perfectly. But, I know that I have a queue and I want to do something more interesting than just make this have the lastAccessTime be infinity.\nSo, I'm going to have this graph work by using an array, an access array here, and so line 26 is here's my queue object. My queue object here, it's going to be like a priority queue, and it's going to have my lastAccessTime for its items and my priority for its items. I store those in my private access array, itemAccess and elementAccess for this graph.\nWhat that means is, if someone adds this to the end of my queue, the first thing that happens is that priority and lastAccessTime is set on line 24. Then, line 28 is called and when it does, it's going to add this edge to the priority queue.\nThat means, if you add this to the end of the queue, it's going to set its access time on line 24, and it's going to set this data on line 28. That's going to be the last piece of data that we're going to store in this array.\nNow, why would I do this? Because I want some way to know when I've processed all of the pieces that are on this queue.\nI'm going to do line 46 as an example to"

        "output": "what are some basics of nutrition that i should be aware of when i'm training for the race, you know, how that would fit in with your regime?\nDave: Well, I'm glad you asked that because a lot of people don't know that nutrition is a very important part of our success in endurance racing. As you mentioned, we're not just going to be up there huffing and puffing for six to ten hours, we're running at a pretty high level of intensity for a pretty long duration of time. And that means that nutrition is really important to keep our glycogen levels fairly high to avoid bonking and going anaerobic.\nKevin: Yup.\nDave: And that's one of the first things I look at with someone who's training for running is how are you going to fuel before and during your race and how you're going to recover afterwards? Recovery is probably the most important part.\nA typical marathon would have about six to eight gels along the way and maybe a cup of fuel. But fueling before you begin your run is not necessary. Most people end up taking on a little bit more than they should. Especially if it's a race, you can go out over-fueled and become nauseous and also have to stop more frequently for bathroom breaks. So usually it's something that you want to look at a little bit closer to the race. What's your strategy there?\nI recommend two to three days before a race, if it's a marathon, a two to three-hour run, to do a long run and fuel exactly how you're going to fuel on the race. That allows you to practice not only getting rid of the fuel you're taking in, but making use of that fuel.\nI also recommend for the two weeks leading up to a marathon to do a run two hours a day, a recovery run which is slower, so you can kind of get in the rhythm of using that fuel. You're doing that two-hour-run thing five times a week, so you're having five opportunities to practice using that fuel.\nWhat I like to see on a day-to-day basis for the marathon would be a recovery day, so maybe one to two hours, then a long run. And then you follow that with a day off. So if you're training for the marathon, you're really training for six weeks with a day off in each week. So I would do that two-three runs a week, and then I would mix it up every now and then with a faster pace, kind of to keep the metabolisms going.\nKevin: So I just want to get this clarified. So we're training five days a week and we're only doing one run per day, so two of those runs are very different from one another. Is that correct?\nDave: Yes, that would be my recommendation for the day-to-day training. But that's not how Kevin is going to practice because he's going to do his daily runs and then he has his training plan that I built for him and it basically matches our coaching plan.\nBasically we'll work on one or two areas that day. We won't spend five hours doing just a long run on a day-to-day basis.\nKevin: Okay. Can I ask something about fueling on one of these runs? How would someone, especially somebody running the Marathon like I am, how would they plan for fueling on these runs?\nDave: Let's just take the marathon as an example. Now we're going to have six to eight gels along the way, but what we're really talking about is about 4,000 to 6,000 calories spread out throughout the day. So when you start putting calories in, you're going to be on fuel from about the time that you wake up on race day until about 24 hours later.\nNow, one part for someone who doesn't use fuel, or who's a fairly light runner, it's a good idea to start using fuel about two or three weeks before. It gives your body time to learn how to use that and give it time when it puts fuel in your system, it actually uses that to keep you going up on the run a little bit longer.\nBut the amount of fuel you're using will depend on the length of the run. Now, you can add more than I recommend for your run, that's a bad idea, but in general, what you can take into a marathon would be 4,000 to 6,000 calories"

How about internal links? You should follow a plan, and your screenwriting software should too. Screenwriting software and keywords are not the only factors that determine your link popularity. A lot of SEO depends on marketing more than anything else to provide inbound and outbound links.\nOn site elements such as inbound links to your content and your site’s position and authority in the SERPs can be very important elements with the on-site elements. You need to ensure that people can find your content quickly and easily. There’s nothing wrong with asking for advice, or paying someone, to give you advice. Some of the older ones I still use, like the 301 redirect tool, the spinner, and some keyword generators.” Google has taken great measures to provide better search engine results by filtering out poor content. The result of which is that, if you are using black hat techniques you will quickly find you are excluded from any searches.\nHappening upon that perfect piece of furniture can be just as exhilarating as that winning lottery ticket can be. You must also ensure you make as many quality links as possible. The only links you should create aren’t in your own blog and they certainly aren’t in your forum signature or other irrelevant place. If you are thinking about keyword ranking to tell you if your blog is good or bad, that’s a total wrong method. It could have a big impact in a positive way if used wisely. Google does not like thin sites and will work better for those who create quality content on their blogs. They know quality means relevant content, images, product/service pages, customer reviews, and great information about their company and locations.\nHat tip: Heather Lloyd-Martin, co-author of Landing Page Optimization and chair of the SEMPO Landing Page Optimization Special Interest Group (SIG). SEO is often confused with search engine advertising, or pay-per-click marketing. While advertising can be a good way to drive short-term traffic to your website, it is also the easiest to game and manipulate. That means your competitors can buy advertising on terms related to your business and you may not know it until you start paying for the traffic you’re generating for your competitors. The key to successful search marketing is a deep understanding of both paid and unpaid strategies, and a relentless focus on the user experience, as these efforts are holistic and rely on all facets of every campaign working in harmony.\nWhile Google clearly has the lion’s share of the search market, Bing and Yahoo still account for almost 30% of all searches, according to comScore. So don’t neglect either search engine. In our experience, if your site is properly optimized for users, it will rank well for search engines. That includes ensuring that users can find what they are looking for, that your pages have plenty of content on the topic of the page and that you have an optimal internal link structure. The next step of search marketing is understanding which search engine optimization, or SEO, tactics are most effective. You’ll also need to decide whether you’re going to do this in-house or with the help of an outside company. And once you’ve settled on SEO tactics and a company to help you execute those tactics, you’ll need to determine how your team is going to measure the success of those efforts."

This entire thing is such an in-your-face assault on the senses. It can be depressing. I try to remember that a large number of people in this country actually oppose this war and that, in the end, we’ll probably prevail, and, the “powers that be” will have to back down. We should encourage as many people as possible to oppose this insane military escalation with Iran.\nAs the US deep state/MIC/Democratic deep state/Israel is getting ready to impose sanctions, it should be pointed out that, like the sanctions on Russia, these are illegal under international law; that it was the US that gave up “international law” back in 2003, when it invaded Iraq; and that, not only will these sanctions hurt the people, it will be the US, not Iran, that will have to back down. It could even turn into an event that ends the deep state’s hegemony, which would be great. The US has the strongest military, is the only country to have ever nuked another and has bombed over a third of the world; so it is easy to think the deep state and the US will prevail; but a lot of other countries are getting tired of this shit and most would rather have a peace-loving Iran than a war-mad US; so, if we do enough work to inform people about this, perhaps it is possible.\nI thought of something else, maybe you’ve already noticed this. On the “right”, you find people who hate Muslims and Iranians and claim they can’t even spell properly and are really Arabs (sounds very “Gaza” to me!) So, I am wondering … who is it who is going to “do the dirty work” of actually fighting the war? Well, I believe the answer is the military itself. As it will become more and more obvious that the war is a disaster and the military is loosing support, perhaps the military will try to make a deal with the “opposition”, to make them cooperate. And it won’t be that much work to just “change” the “other” side. After all, both, or most, right wingers AND liberals hate Muslims, and we’re being told the Iranians are Arabs (notice too that, in Arab countries, the right wingers and the liberals have been fighting each other forever, especially in Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, and Yemen – where Muslims have been killing each other for decades!). So, isn’t it possible that the liberals and the right wingers get together for the common goal of hating Arabs? – It’s already happening in Europe, where they call the refugees “Muslims”, but don’t really care if the refugees are Muslim or not (as Europeans will never be Muslims). – After all, the US doesn’t mind killing Muslims – isn’"

Please share some input with me. I wrote a book for my daughter on an autism spectrum. When she was 17, her doctor told us that this was a very common disorder for girls. She also had bone fragility and a few other issues. He then sent my daughter and I to a 3 day workshop on autism. From that weekend, I was driven to write the book because I knew there were so many girls and women on the autism spectrum that could benefit. I have self-published and have sold about 300. I have not marketed it the way I should have because I am working full time.\nMy question is for the folks on here. Do you know if I need a copyright for my book? I just sent it off to be submitted to the Library of Congress. If I do need a copyright, may I send your information to them?\nMy book is titled Finding Me. It is a workbook and guide for girls and young women with autism. It is my hope that this book will help hundreds of young girls find themselves. It has been two years since the book was published, but in that time I have not actively marketed my book.\nShirley, I am a fellow attendee to Mark Coker's class and have a few questions if you are able. Are you able to send me your book by email? What type of ebook format are you using? Are you able to send me a copyright?\nFinding Me is a workbook and guide for girls on the autism spectrum. It is also a tool to help these girls find themselves."

It'll probably be me going around to 10 other managers and asking them if they'll let me publish something, but that's what I hope. I also have the first 30 days of an interview plan where I'll ask my manager to send me to various meetings or give me various responsibilities, mostly so I can see what all these jobs really do, and see which ones would be good for me. Then I can talk about them to my manager and if I can do them, and then write about them in my daily journal in order to record them for my resume. I can definitely improve the things that I have in my journal right now, so I might as well fill it out with some more details. I can probably work some of the things I do into the daily journal itself as I have more experience with them. On the flip side though, I don't want to do anything I'll end up just being bad at eventually. I want to do things that I'm good at right away and then I will have more interesting details to talk about. I also have the daily journal for a 10 point review at the end of the first 30 days, where I am to rate my performance against the standard of the work I set for myself. Basically, I've set 20 goals and I have to check off how many I accomplished every day so that if by some chance I haven't had a decent day, then I can know for sure I actually did something right. I think that's all going to work, but let's see how it takes, I guess.\nI just don't know how to plan things out. I have the plan for the first day and that gives me 18 days to figure out how to plan things for days... 2 through 18! (I probably don't have to account for weekends, do I...?) It really makes me appreciate the people who actually know how to plan things out well in advance. I have 10 \"firsts\" in mind for things to do for my first 30 days: • First day: 6th December 2019 I need to get to work, I have a project that needs to get done, and then I need to meet with my direct manager, in order to give him an update on my status, and also ask him for a specific task to work through. • Second day: I will learn more about the process in my team. I will look through the code base, the build system, and also talk with the team leads and the principal to learn more about what I need to learn. • Third day: In the morning, I will need to write out a plan for how I spend the rest of the week. I will write a plan for what needs to get done by the end of the week, what I should do to prepare for that, and what I need to do to pass my first 30-day review that is currently scheduled for 6th December 2019. • Fourth day: I will continue the plan I drafted through the other three days, and try to do things like what is in the third and fourth plans.\n• Fifth Day: I will talk to my direct manager (the one that's in charge of my day to day production) about what is in my plan, and what is important for them, and I will try to follow through with what he wants to see, so I can give him a plan for this week as well, to give me time to get other tasks to get done. • Sixth day: I will try to figure out how to be useful while I'm doing tasks, like answering questions in chat, and being active in the different projects we have going.\n• Seventh Day: I will figure out how to schedule things. Figure out how to figure out how to schedule things.\n• Eighth Day: I will figure out what types of things I should be doing. I will talk with the team leads and principal, and the other engineers, to try to figure out what to do, and where can I be helpful outside of the project I'm currently working on. Figure out how to plan for day two, figuring out what type of things I should be doing, and what type of things are coming up.\n• Ninth Day: I will figure out some actual things to do that are beyond the planning for the day. I will ask my manager what project ideas from the general work of the team could I handle right away.\n• T"

It was hard finding my groove in school. In a time period when women are seeking equal rights, this is a relevant time to consider such questions, as well as the role of society, government, education and other institutions in addressing gender roles.\nI have to buy this one for sure, it sounds like such an interesting read, and I think it would be fun to discuss with students as well.\nIt sits on my desk right now. If anyone who wants to have the free of this book or just donated the book here I will gladly donate it to another parent. As a matter of fact, one of the parents that we are working with is reading it as a group. When we are done we meet to discuss the book and then we plan some type of project that we can do around gender.\nMost men are not capable of recognizing when that time has truly come. The author of this article mentions about the fatherhood in United States and the lack of resources for those who want to be fathers.\nThis book will surely encourage anyone who is trying to be a good father or is a father who wants to be better.\nAt best some readers may disagree with parts of the bookbut that is good, as long as they disagree because they took the time to review the book and give their opinions.\nAnother interesting point is that women typically wait until about age 25 before having children and this is when they can begin to start to think about getting married. This is why we decided to make the focus on Men and Fathers.\nI just finished reading an interesting book called Pieces Never Missing in a Childs Life by Dwayne Meeks. I am currently half way through the book and I am so inspired.\nWhile I believe that women and men should have equal roles in child-raising and society in general, I believe that it should be left up to individuals to figure out how to do it, and not forced on them, in which case we would never know if a father and a mother, or a father and two fathers, or two mothers could produce a viable and healthy child.\nAnother interesting point is that women typically wait until about age 25 before having children and this is when they can begin to start to think about getting married.\nMost women are unable to have children in their late 20s due to biological reasons. As a result, women are taking 16-18 years before they are able to have their own children.\nAnother interesting point is that women typically wait until about age 25 before having children and this is when they can begin to start to think about getting married.\nThe book Pieces Never Missing in a Childs Life is about the challenges that fathers, particularly men of color, must over come to take full and active role in the lives of their children. The book focuses on the issues that many fathers must maneuver through, when they want to be an involved father.\nIf we were more involved it would definitely change how we perceive our roles.

This book had a good point of view and a very clear message.\nFathers of adolescent children were more likely to report that adolescents from a previous relationship or birth children were not close.\nMany fathers are faced with unrealistic expectations from their wives or their children, which can lead fathers to feel that they are not a good parent.\nMale Involvement in Children’s Education Essay - In the article written by Meeks that we have discussed this week, he discusses how low male involvement has risen over the years.\nThe author provides a list of solutions ranging from political to social, personal and gender, but offers no recommendatin.

Education is also one of the six key thematic areas of our Global Peace Initiative. The GPF is calling on institutions, organisations and individuals to engage in dialogues with the youth to ensure that they create value that is going to be of benefit to the African Continent and the Global Community at large.\nTo this point we are launching a campaign that is targeted at ensuring that youths in South Africa are equipped to better understand the history of where they come from and thereby develop a mindset of peace and respect for diversity.\nWith that in mind the Foundation is calling for a partnership that will raise the awareness about South Africa's history in context of the Global Peace Initiative of Empowerment & Enlightenment.\nThe foundation is looking to the people living in the Western Cape particularly the people living in the City of Cape Town who have contributed to the making of history in the Western Cape and in South Africa in general. Most especially those persons of Indian and Muslim descent who have played leading roles in creating history especially the contribution of Muslims in the making of the Western Cape the role they played in creating the legislative framework of the Western Cape.\nThe Western Cape Province has seen many changes with respect to who was leading and what were their contribution to building the Western Cape into what it has become today. With this context in mind the Foundation is encouraging people living in the Western Cape who have played leading roles either in the past of today to speak out of their life’s story. They may do that through a video or photo testimonial or written submissions as part of our campaign.\nThe submission will be used to create awareness in relation to the history of the South Africa’s Struggle History and the history of the Peace Struggle in the Western Cape.\nThe Campaign will focus on the life of the people who have played a significant role in the peace struggle of South Africa. As of now we have called for these stories and are encouraged to continue with that in the interest of making available the history of the peace struggle in South Africa.\nWe have invited organisations and individuals particularly in Cape Town to engage in this process.

        "output": "there used to be a program for winmx called mcma, what does mcma stand for and what does the program do?\nmCMA is the name of a program which used to be used with WinMX. It allowed WinMX users to play .mp3 songs from their computer to a WinMX player. It's no longer in use, and it's likely there are some out there with WinMX players who forgot about it.\nIf I may, I would like to mention for others that the following instructions work for WinMX-7.4.\n* You want to set up a \"Music List on My Computer\"\n* If the list of songs on a My Computer location are not sorted by artist/album/etc., click the \"Sort by Artist\" button at the top of the WinMX directory to manually sort the music. For example, if the artist or album name are not sorted, select it then press \"Sort by Artist\".\n* When you get the list of songs on My Computer, copy and paste your list of songs into the \"Music in My Computer Location\" box (highlighted in the next picture).\nThen press the \"Submit\" button.\nIt worked pretty well for me. Most of my songs are in mp3 format anyways...so it is probably okay if your songs are in another format than mp3.\nI believe that WinMX does have a pretty good sound quality, so I use WinMX when I have the bandwidth for it.\nAmazingly enough, while searching that information, I came across your question through Google and I realized that I know some of the information you are looking for and I want to share that information with you and anyone else who may benefit from my post.\nNow here is the first bit of information: What does mCMA stand for and what does the program do?\nI was unable to find any sites that offered mCMA's programs or even a program in it's entirety. I did, however, find some bits of information.\nWhat Does mCMA Do?\nAs you may already know, mCMA was one of the programs designed to be used with WinMX. The main purpose of mCMA is to transfer MP3s, although it can be used for other formats. The MP3s that you upload to mCMA or use from mCAM can be played by WinMX's player. The user can select a category and a number of MP3s from that category will play automatically. The user could manually select others (by album, artists, etc) to play as well.\nWhat Makes mCMA Unique?\nIn a sense, it is like having an old fashioned jukebox. The user can select a category (i-e. Rock, Country, Blues), select a number of songs (that are in the category), and a group of songs play automatically. The user doesn't have to go through menus to select an artist to play. The user can either let their WinMX player just cycle through all of their files or they can select certain files from the list to play manually.\nHow the program was used:\nStep 1: In the beginning the user had to load their music onto the computer. After they transfered the music onto the computer they would then have to start up their mCMA program.\nStep 2: Once they got into the mCMA setup page they had to choose between a couple of options, such as where to store your music, how many computers you would allow mCMA onto (limited to 2 on WinMX), how many songs you would allow to be played simultaneously, and choosing which types of music to play (i.e. only Country, or only Rock--you had to choose between different categories (such as: Country, Rock, Blues, etc.)\nStep 3: After the user entered the information in the first page, they were taken to the play page. On this page users would choose between all of the options including which type of music to allow, the number of songs that would be played, the number of minutes of time you would set aside each day to listen.\nStep 4: After the user had finished all of that information, then they could get to the \"fun\" part. They would first have to choose the music to be played (which is similar to setting up a regular WinMX directory). One thing to remember is that after you set the categories (i.e. blues, or rock) it would also need to be set up by album (i-e. the different albums that are in the category).\nExample, I am going to say that I was using Country as my main category. In order to have my music play as \"Country\" music I would need to add a category \"Country\""

And I need to know all of this before building a site. If building a site just involves taking text from the page in WordPress, I don't feel like it's worth it. Sure there's some extra markup and css involved but if it's the same values anyway ... well, not really worth it. A bit like this article is about to become :)\n\nAnswer: The thing is, you don't create a Wordpress site for 2 pages. Wordpress is a CMS and you integrate it with the website which has its own CMS.\n\nNow, when you are adding a 3rd party plugin to a website CMS, be that Wordpress or whatever other, it is important to know what you want to achieve with it and what you are not going to implement yourself. In your case, it looks like that is:\n\n1.A place where you upload the questionnaire files (maybe CSVs)\n\n2.A place that the users go to to answer the questionnaire.\n\n3.Maybe a place for you to publish the analyses of those questionnaires\n\nSo my advise would be:\n\n1.Pick some good looking, easy to use and maintain solution. Google search for it. Someone will find it\n\n2.Build the front-end based on the solution you chose in 1.\n\n3.Do it with Wordpress or whatever CMS you want. It doesn't really matter at this point as it will be integrated with the front end later on.\n\nHope that helps. :-)\n\nComment: Just to clarify, what you're saying is that building a WordPress site doesn't really require a lot of planning or knowledge up front. It's just about taking a good solution and integrating it with WordPress.\nI really appreciate your answer, and I agree with all of it. It does make me lean further toward a static site generator so that I don't have to use WordPress as the site's front-end, because I don't think WordPress is a great candidate for this app. I should be able to build this without a CMS. Do you think that a static site generator is my best bet here?\n\nComment: I think that is the way you should go, yes. But the only disadvantage is that you would have to maintain it manually, which I guess it's not an issue for you anyway.\n\nComment: This is good, I appreciate your insight. I think that it's worth doing this project without WordPress. I feel more like a developer than a product manager at this point, but I also want to feel like a product manager."

Virtualization is not new to industry, and has been used for years by technology\nproviders. The biggest names are IBM, Oracle, and EMC, with HP and Microsoft also\nbeing a part of the virtualization party.\n6. This section will review all the companies and describe their role in virtualization\nIBM is the big name in virtualization, and has been for many years. In\n2006 they bought VMware for $6.5 billion and integrated with their\nsoftware to bring more power to the IT department and lower\ncosts and increase performance for business and the user. Some\nof their products are:\n IBM Virtualization Engine\n Server virtualization\n Infrastructure management\n Private virtualization\n High Availability\nOracle also has a strong base in the software community and provides\na powerful set of products to assist in the virtualization process.\nTheir products include:\n Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC)\n Fusion Middleware Server\n Data Guard\n Oracle VM\n Oracle VM For Z\n Partitioning, sharing and allocation of resources\nEMC is not as strong in their virtualization products and technology as\nIBM or Oracle, however, they do have a strong presence in the storage\nand backup market. EMC’s core strength is in the backup and high\navailability of a datacenter. EMC produces the Symmetrix and\nCelerra storage systems. These systems are used by businesses for\nhigh availability and backup of data. EMC does not supply hardware\nvirtualization; it uses the power VMware to run these Virtual Machines\n(VM). The EMC is a partner that specializes in high availability, back up,\nand business continuity. This is where EMC shines when it comes to\nvirtualization technology. EMC also has a partnership with VMware\nand offers their own solutions.\nMicrosoft is also a big player in the virtualization market space.\nNot just in the virtualization space, but also in the operating system\nplatform space as well. Microsoft is responsible for many technologies\nin use today, including Windows, Office and IIS. Microsoft also\nprovides virtualization options for most of their operating systems such as\nWindows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Microsoft\nHyper-V. Microsoft’s virtualization products include:\n Microsoft Hyper-V\n Virtual Machine Console\n Guest Operating Systems\nThese products allow for multiple guests to run at the same time\nwithout interfering with each other. This gives Microsoft the ability to\ncompete with large players such as IBM.\n7. Virtualization is not limited to just IT infrastructure, it also can be used in\ncommunication lines to allow for a connection between the IT infrastructure.\nCommunication lines used consist of:\nLAN – local area network\nWAN – the wide area network\nSAN – storage area network\nGlue - the part that connects the two and makes the switch.\n8. The following are the top uses of virtualization:\n Computing - using a hypervisor for virtualized computing\n Networking - allowing access between virtual machines on LAN, WAN and\n Virtualized storage - using hardware disk drives\n Sensor network - using virtualization to help monitor and protect vital information\n Wireless virtualization - for providing a framework for a virtual wireless network\n VMM (Virtual Machine Manager) - the management software that is used\n VM (virtual machine) - software that is being managed\n VMDK (Virtual Machine Disk) - files that allow a running operating system to be\nloaded onto a virtual server.\n9. The main benefits of virtualization are:\n Ability to reuse virtual instances of servers"

Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds.\nFor my part, I agree that one could probably be convinced to write a letter. Apart from anything else, it might help him to think things through from a different angle.\nNo doubt many of us could tell him much of what he needs to understand.\n@Snubby. What makes you think he won't be informed of any objections? Do you doubt the veracity of his source because she's 'staring into the void'? I have a theory:\nWhat we perceive as the ‘void’ is in fact a ‘void’ (no pun intended) which is exactly where something is always trying to come from.\nThe ‘void’ of infinity is an attempt by God ‘Infinite’ to move further into creation (infinity into the finite realm) and ‘tighten’ the ‘loose end’ that is life from which all that we perceive is created.\nThis ‘loose end’ is what we perceive as entropy: randomness, disorder.\nThis ‘tightening’ is what causes things to become more ordered, life to evolve and our universe to expand.\nIt explains all that we perceive (ie in accordance with the universe).\nGod being Infinite, being able to ‘tighten’ the infinite, can only get a finite distance into the realm of finite existence (ie to our ‘void’). But what’s really happening isn’t that God becomes finite, but only through a paradox (and paradoxes don’t exist): because God is Infinite, the closer something moves towards becoming infinite in the finite realm (ie towards becoming the Infinite God), the closer it gets to becoming equal to God (and God cannot be greater than Itself so It must turn into Itself).\nThis is what all of creation experiences.\nThis is the ‘tightening’ and this is what leads to a world being formed from the void.\nWhat happens later is the process of the world forming life, which when in a universe of only ‘life’, (which we, and possibly God, must understand are completely different realms of existence), and we as individuals ‘devolve’ to the level of life, then, without the life evolving from that life, nothing (except for the life) can exist in that finite finite realm (ie in the finite realm of that world (which must be formed from that ‘infinite’ life)).\nIf you’re not happy to take my word for it, ask for proof (or ask for the ‘proof’ from my source which has so impressed Snubby and other).\nIf you’re not happy with the ‘proof’, then ask for a ‘proof’ that the Earth goes round the Sun or that the Earth is 5000 years old.\nIf you’re not happy with that, then ask for a ‘proof’ that I’m not Santa Claus.\nSnubby: \" I can’t think of any example that falls into the first category. And what has ‘scientific’ have to do with it?\"\nAsk yourself how does science (what I do for a living to pay my rent, and which you pay tax for) work? And how do laws/scientific theories/etc work?\nThen you'll see that it works by people submitting hypotheses, proving them and/or disproving them with evidence/facts, etc, and then deciding whether it is true or not.\nHow do you decide whether something is true or not? On the evidence you saw, with the knowledge from your training.\nHence, if something is claimed to be a 'law' or something, a natural thing to do would be to ask the person what the evidence is. And there are two possibilities:\n1/ If he knows the evidence then he would present it.\n2/ If he doesn't give you the evidence, then you ask yourself whether the evidence is presenting itself, and how you would go about proving that with the knowledge you have.\nIn short: evidence for your belief, otherwise evidence for the existence of evidence if it's required, else you can't decide whether it's true or not.\nWhether he sees the evidence or not doesn't matter anymore. If what he says is true, he will have evidence. If not, then he can't get evidence unless he creates it first, and then he can use the evidence to prove his beliefs.\nIt's the same with science. You can't decide whether a theory is true or not without evidence or evidence from the laws. And what evidence is evidence if it"

        "output": "find a word that represents people reacting to unpleasant events in a way that brings relief with a degree of excitement.\nBut we don't know what the word is. In this article, we go on a hunt for what would be the perfect candidate.\nIts not so simple as going to thesaurus.com and finding a new word to replace one of these terms. Its about finding a word that represents the concepts that are associated with those terms, and finding a word that is new and interesting - not one that is often used.\nThe most useful tool for finding such a word is the Google NGram Viewer. Basically, it lets you look up the frequency of words or phrases for any given time period, and then plot it on a graph. You can control the year-span of the search, and the number of results you get back.\nUsing this tool, I searched for the ten most-used words or combinations of words for \"news\", \"disaster\" and \"weather\". Using the Ngram Viewer, we can see the change of use over time (as well as the exact numbers of results), and also see if a particular combination has ever been as much of a sensation as the current news headlines suggest.\nYou can read our analysis of this below, or jump to this page, and see for yourselves.\nHere's the analysis.\nSo how have the news headlines changed over the last 162 years? To answer that question, we have plotted the results from the year 1850, to the year 2012. This was done by searching for the terms used in the news articles of those periods, and then plotting the results on a graph. To search by all these, and other words and terms relevant to the question, click here.\nThe top ten results after the year 1850\ndisaster weather weather weather weather weather weather weather weather weather weather weather weather weather news news weather news world war world war war world war usus world war world disaster cold war disaster news war cold war cold war\nIt can be seen that the word \"weather\" has been consistently the most used subject for news articles over the last several decades, sometimes gaining the lead over \"news\", and \"disaster\". This suggests that weather seems to be a more interesting, more important topic for journalism.\nBetween the years of 1850 and 1930, as disaster and news were not that common, the interest in weather changed. Somewhat confusingly, the interest in weather increased and decreased during this period. This means that the average interest in weather articles increased during that time. The interest decreased slightly, especially between the years of 1850 and 1910. The interest increased again and has increased steadily since then. There is an acceleration of interest recently, suggesting that weather has become even more important and more interesting for journalists and readers alike.\nIt can also be seen that \"news\" started gaining interest between 1920 and 1930. This was the time of the rise of radio news as well as the \"talkies\", so it is likely that the availability and interest in news articles increased because of the mass availability and easier understanding of news.\nAfter 1930, disaster articles become much less frequent, for the first time since 1850. This would suggest that disasters are less in fashion than ever before. It is unclear why this could have happened. Possibly a change in technology, perhaps the Great Depression meant that disasters were less likely, or perhaps the disaster topic fell out of favour with the public. One effect of this is that news stories dropped out of favour by the same year.\nThis graph represents the interest in the particular words, terms or phrases that compose a particular word. This means that you get a sense of what people like to read about - not just how frequently. For the three words \"news\", \"disaster\" and \"weather\", you can see that the most popular phrase has been \"world news disaster\", or \"news weather disaster\" or \"world news weather\" over the last few decades. So one major insight of this graph is that when it comes to the news, people love hearing about weather disasters.\nTo understand how the patterns have changed over time, we have plotted the results for two sets of data: the first for 1960-2005, the second 2005-present\nAs before, we see \"weather\" continuing to dominate \"news\", and \"weather\" coming close to \"news\" over the last few years. The other interesting observation are the huge spikes of interest in \"world news disaster"

        "output": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?\nAn example of the relationship between these thinkers is in their similar understandings of violence. In his analysis of how the American Jewish establishment responded to the war in Vietnam, Kahane writes: \"I ask you to imagine a new and strange experience that is as alien to you as it is to me. Imagine that you and I are suddenly to be sent off, together with a few thousand others, to join the Vietnam front. We would be sent to fight in foreign land, among foreign people -- people of another religion. We would have to struggle against our fellow countrymen, and to do so we must have ready access to the arms with which they would try to defend themselves. And we must use our own arms to defend ourselves, and our fellows, against them\"(52).\nSimilarly to the American Jewish Establishment, who could not \"redefine the struggle as a class war which, though a struggle within the Jewish people, does not involve the Jewish religion\" (53), Kahane could not redefine the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as a class warfare of Palestinians fighting for their land versus Israelis struggling for their survival. He saw the war in the context of nationalism and race wars, and hence of \"mak[ing] the Jewish people a righteous, holy, and chaste nation\" (64). In this struggle, Kahane believed that violence was the only method of achieving his goals.\nLike Fanon, Zizek and Kahane believed that the end did justify the means as long as no one is actually hurt. \"Whatever we may do, if we don't kill a single innocent person we won't bring a single Palestinian to his knees, because this is a war, for which the only weapons possible are weapons of war\"(64). \"No one should claim that there is no connection between Jews and Israel. Every Jew who holds the state in his heart, even secretly, is an Israeli in the heart and body\"(65).\nIn this context, Zizek and Kahane believed that while violence may be ineffectual, it is an acceptable method for achieving one's goals. As much as both Fanon and Zizek believed their methods were morally sound, it is apparent that Kahane's are not. It is this difference in morality of the three men, this difference in their relation to religion and to violence, that gives Fanon and Zizek credibility in their analysis of violence whereas Kahane does not.\nHowever, there is not just a relationship between violence and the American Jewish Establishment. Rather, there is an almost uncanny similarity in the views of all three theorists when examining Judaism and race. In his analysis of the relationship between Judaism and race, Zizek writes: \"But it is hard to find a passage of the Old Testament not charged with anti-black racism. One of the major themes of the Old Testament is the racial/cultural Othering of blacks, and the inevitability of the clash between blacks and the Israelites\" (144).\nSimilarly, Kahane describes the struggle of Zionist youth groups, who he refers to as \"Zionist youth\" (52), as they \"would, of course, not be allowed to openly attack Jews... The young men therefore, as the [American] Jewish Establishment feared, were forced to seek an alternative expression for their anger\"(53). Kahane goes on to say, \"The alternative was a struggle to cleanse Israel of non-Jews. This was an effort of extreme importance for the future of the Jewish state\" (53). \"In 1952 we founded the Kibbutz Movement, and we made a conscious effort to cleanse the kibbutzim of non-Jews. In fact, the whole youth organization was directed to take this effort on as the most important one. We used to say in meetings that there were three kinds of people who were a danger to Israel and to Judaism. Non-Jews who live among us; assimilated Jews who have forgotten their history... And the third danger was Jews who had forgotten their history\" (35). \"When I entered the religious kibbutzim, I was the one who asked to see the Arab villages... We learned our Judaism from those Arab villages, not from the yeshiva\" (69).\nZizek says the same: \"In its"

On the next morning the train was on time, and they arrived without trouble in Philadelphia. This was a good thing, for on this morning the boys had much to do to prepare for their journey.\nYou see, they had decided that they should make the journey through Pennsylvania by way of the Kiskiminetas River and the Allegheny, and they had made this decision for a good reason — to see more country. Moreover, since they had already covered the New England states and a part of New York they had to go through these areas to get home. Besides, the trip along these rivers in the autumn, with the foliage at its best, would be a splendid pleasure to them; nor was this pleasure altogether out of the way. The Kiskiminetas was never, even in the early days, a very large river, nor was the Allegheny either for that matter. But they were full of life and beauty. Between the banks of these rivers lay a great many small farms, some of them not more than twenty or twenty-five acres in size, but on most of these farms they found a home.\nHere, too, they found the farmers themselves, for these were, after all, people who lived in the country. They saw the waggons coming home loaded with corn, and the barns and granaries filled with their crop; they saw the young girls working in the fields and the young boys going to school; and they saw, too, many things of which even the schoolboys may yet learn much.\nIt was about two o'clock on that afternoon when the boys and their parents found themselves on the boat at the wharf, and a young man named William Caldwell, who had been their driver, came and took them through the streets of Pittsburgh to the station. There they were on time for their train, and about the same hour on the following afternoon they once more drew up to the depot at New York. Here they found their baggage safe, although they had received their valises only after a good deal of trouble. It seems that the train was in haste to arrive at New York, and, instead of stopping for some time at the station before Pittsburgh, it stopped only long enough \"to unload and get under way again.\"\nThat was just what the boys and their parents had expected to happen, and therefore they had sent their baggage ahead. Now at last they could get what they needed, but the boys were the wiser as to when they had seen enough. They told their father they would not start to walk up the Avenue until the morning — they were weary.\nThen they took a carriage and drove to Broadway, where they took dinner at Delmonico's. After this meal, the youngest of the boys, who just turned thirteen, went for a short walk with his mother and the older boys walked about New York for a while.\nThey all felt that they knew New York a good deal better now than they knew it when they were there some months before; but there was still much to see. They went down to the wharves, but they could not take the tug boats because the tides at that time of the year, just after the fall, were too low to float them, so they returned to the hotel.\nThat night when the boys were in bed with the lights out and they were all saying good night, they began to think, not about the morrow, but about what they had seen, what they had heard, and what they had done, since they had last said good night.\n\"Father,\" asked Ned, \"how far is New York from Washington, and how long did it take us to go from here?\"\n\"By the Kiskiminetas River and the Allegheny we are twelve hundred miles from Washington, and it took us eighteen hours by train to go that far.\"\n\"Twelve hundred miles,\" repeated Ned, \"why that was the voyage of Captain Cook to Japan when he went around the world by sea. How in the name of common sense could Captain Cook's voyage be two hundred miles?\"\n\"What did your father have to do with Captain Cook?' asked his mother.\n\"That's what I can't understand, mother. Can anyone go around the world by sea, as we do it with trains?\" Ned asked. \"No,\" said his father; \"in the time of the ancients great men built great things and now at last the railroads have built a great tunnel under the Atlantic. Who will go first, we or the ancients?\"\nIt was too late to talk about these things."

So we do a few workshops, come up with an idea, start coding, it's going good then all of a sudden we're under pressure to get things done quickly. Then we have an issue, so we need to get a QA person from another department. Now the customer wants changes. I'm not telling you not to use agile, it has its place. But I'm telling you you need to take your time, and work it out. Agile should be a process, not a sprint.

In addition to global warming, it is now\nestimated that the earth is being bombarded with a constant,\nunprecedented, 2-5% erosion of the earth’s ozone layer every day.\nIn the U.S., a congressional commission has warned that the nation\ncould see a 20% to 50% rate of cancer over the next three decades\nif the ozone hole is not stopped or remedied.\nThe ozone layer protects the earth against 70% of the UV radiation\nwhich causes the earth’s surface to heat up, and has also proven to\nbe highly effective in blocking the effect of greenhouse gases.\nRecent studies indicate that the average global temperature of the\nearth since 2010 has been at its highest level in recorded history.\nWhile some of the increase may be the result of natural variations,\nmost scientists attribute the higher temperatures to the greenhouse\neffect and increased levels of greenhouse gases. And, according to\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), if manmade\nemissions of CO2 continue to increase throughout the century, the\ntemperatures of the earth will be a whopping five degrees\nFahrenheit hotter just a century from now than they are today.\nThis prediction, unless proven wrong, would make life on earth next\ncentury very different from life today.

I'm not surprised to hear that. We have some excellent programs in the UK but as with the US, the quality of many scripted shows is dropping in recent years. So I suspect I will be just as pleased to see the end of them as you.\nOn a slightly different subject however, I was surprised at the low quality of DVD of 'Battlestar Galactica'. In the final season the video quality was very poor from time to time. I believe they use high definition cameras but their equipment (or what they do with it) just doesn't seem up to scratch. I would like to buy my own copy but was put off after seeing the standard of those made for sale in the shops.\nI recently bought a set of 'Monty Bore's Springwatch' and it was very pleasing! It was all in HD and the quality was superb, so much so I'm pleased with the whole set.\nI have recently bought the box set of 'Life' which was a great box set until I found out it was encoded to UK only NTSC but not in HD. I sent a complaint to both BBC worldwide who make the box set and a complaint to the BBC who commissioned it. Hopefully I will get a refund or some other form of compensation for buying a non working HD boxset.\nAt least I know I will be able to buy a copy of 'The Wire' soon here in the UK and hopefully all the remaining seasons of 'Life'.\n'Wire' and 'Life' are my 2 favourite 'box sets' ever (including box sets of TV series).\nPlease look at this article if anyone hasn't heard this yet:\nhttp://www.engadget.com/2009/02/08/the-wire-is-coming-to-the-uk/\nPosted by: Mark B | Tuesday, 10 February 2009 at 04:10 PM\nBattlestar Galactica was indeed shot and edited in HD, but the original release in the US was standard def.

I recall seeing at least one episode on YouTube that showed the difference quite well - even in regular HD the episode was quite dark.\nIt is possible to buy an HDTV that can downconvert a 720p signal to 1080i, but I would suggest against it. Those kinds of TVs, like their SD equivalents, have serious degradation of signal after the signal processing.

        "output": "how do I appear in a video call as if I'd be actively listening while I am actually sleeping?\nAndrew, I'm surprised that you don't consider a video of a screen to be an effective form of communication. If you really need to see the person and hear their voice while they're talking, you'd use Skype or FaceTime. It sounds like you're making excuses about why you find video conferencing uncomfortable in order to just tell people you're uncomfortable.\nIn any case, I get that people have different tolerance levels for stuff, but honestly I just don't understand at all. The point of Skype or FaceTime isn't for me to look at you while you're talking?\nMy dad doesn't have any use for video conferencing because he's deaf, but even he has a Skype account – for the same reason you have a Twitter account. You might not use it much when you have your phone, but if there's ever a need for it, you've got it! I suspect the same is true for video conferencing.\nThere are some jobs, like teaching, that require a certain level of communication, and video conferencing is an effective way to communicate over a distance.\nI work from home, but I use a video conferencing program every week for team meetings. This wouldn't be possible if I never used it. You just never know when you're going to need it.\nAndrew September 1st, 2015\nI’d certainly agree with the need to have a Skype account, but not with video conferencing. The point in having a Skype account is for people to call, and text if needed. The purpose of calling is to have a conversation with a person, and not with a screen. That isn’t meant to sound unkind. It is just that, as I have pointed out, I’m very particular about what I am uncomfortable with. Calling on the phone is something I am uncomfortable about. I am totally fine with video conferencing, but only after having had a chance to talk on the phone, and be friends with whoever I am going to do video conferencing with.\nThis is not to say that you cannot do video conferencing with a person you have never talked to before, or with those you do not know well – I would recommend doing that with people you are not comfortable with, or who you are not sure about, or with whom you may get into conflicts – but for me (and there is nothing bad about this) it is a very slow process of getting used to this kind of communication.\nI don’t think you’ll get much from making excuses about why you find video conferencing, or any similar type of communication as you find it to be uncomfortable, but, if you truly wish, I might be able to help you a bit.\nLet’s start with the fact that you are totally comfortable with talking on the phone, and texting. So, if I say, “I’d like to invite you to have a video chat”, or anything like that, you will feel a “sense of threat” in your gut.\nNow that we have that figured out, you have noticed an unwanted change. You have noticed that the change was caused by a voice coming from a speaker that your eyes saw, and a voice of which you only heard one-half.\nYou have, without much doubt, heard about people who have been killed by a gun (you may be one of them – it hasn’t happened to me yet). Also you know about people who were killed by a knife, or someone who was killed for some reason that you do not know of – as you don’t know for sure. People sometimes run over others for no apparent reason with cars, and people get killed by cars that just ran over someone for some reason that you do not know – this too is not a pleasant thought, but a thought nonetheless. Now, if you are going to kill someone (unfortunately), the more you know about this person, the lesser the chance that you will go off and kill a random stranger without knowing.\nIt is the same with all forms of committing some physical and most definitely emotional violence (it being verbal, or gesturing) – if you do not know well the people that you are going to interact with, the violence that you may inflict on them, and the fact that this violence may cause them harm and pain; the more likely it is you will inflict violence on them.\nIf you don’t have that much trouble with talking on the phone, or texting, and you have done it hundreds or thousands of times before, chances are that you are very likely"

The russian are the ones who live in the Crimea (Moldovans and other non-russian Slavic people). So Crimeans are not russian, they are the ones living in the Crimea, who happened to be russian. Do you understand the concept of ownership?\"\nNow, do you still want me to make this as simple as possible for you and others having this confusion with this issue? Please, tell me whether you want me to simply answer your question with a yes or no.\nIf you do want me to, my answer would be yes. They are living in the Crimea. They have been living there for hundreds of years. They have been living there ever since the Ottomans were running wild.\nThe reason i know is, my great grandfather told me so.\nWhy the west should not intervene?\nAnd by that, you were thinking of the NATO. However, if you think that is the way to go, you would better learn how to speak properly in English; otherwise, people like you end up being used as a tool to promote the interest of Russia. It is just so sad that people like you are being used by the Russian government that, if one of your relatives or friends would not be as ignorant as you right now, he or she could be killed by one of the russian soldiers now occupying some of the Crimean peninsula.\nHaving said that, let me tell you now what the European Union could do if they wanted to make Russia pay for the trouble it has created.\nThe EU has done everything right up till now. All they've done was to ask Russia what it believes it needs to do to resolve the situation. That is it! The EU has not done anything militarily; so, the only thing they can do is to not be like Russia. This means that the EU needs to make sure that they do to make Russia pay for the trouble it has created. I'm sorry to inform you that this is not the 19th century any longer. This means that the EU will have to go to some other places; not Crimea, of course. My suggestion should be the following:\n1. The EU (meaning Germany and the other European countries) needs to make sure that they will not need Russia for any supply of their gas. They need to cut a deal with the Americans and go back to the 19th century (when Americans did not have much electricity to run their air conditioners) and start living like that.\n2. The EU needs to increase their own supply of gas, coal, and oil (including all the other resources that America currently supplies for Germany).\n3. The EU needs to build their own airplane industry, which will be used by the EU to fly over to Crimea and bomb this Russian aggression.\n4. The EU needs to make Russia pay, if they don't do any of the things mentioned above.\nIf the above things are done well by the EU, then Russia will not have any choice but to withdraw. Also, if the above things are done well by the EU, this means that the West will win. On the other hand, if the above things are not done well by the EU, the West will lose.\nThis way, the NATO will win, and the United States will be the winner, and the Russian government will get destroyed, and we will all feel safe again.\nWhat i do not understand is why do the russians want Crimea? They can not make the Crimeans their own , and they have no money , all the oil money is spent by Putin, so what they are doing now ? I believe for you the case is clear , so please tell me why Russians want Crimea ?\nNow, i will try to tell you why the Russians are in the Crimea. The Russians are in the Crimea because a referendum was held some time ago and a majority of the Crimeans voted to rejoin Russia, and this majority has now been changed by Russia to mean a majority who does not exist.\nHowever, what is more important is the fact that the Crimeans are asking Russia to give a lot of their citizenship. It is like the people from the United States asking Canada if they can take some Canadians with them to the United States. That is the basic question.\nI do not really see why Russia wants Crimea.

I will discuss the three major types of sarcoidosis: pulmonary, Lungs can develop this condition due to bacteria, viruses, and allergens or exposure to certain substances can trigger this disease. In some cases, a disease, sarcoidosis can develop in many organs and tissues of the body that can cause life-threatening complications.\nThese complications not only have serious health problems in themselves but also interfere with your ability to live your normal life. Some complications include abnormal heart rhythm, stroke, weakened and infected lungs, liver, nervous system, skin, and eyes.\nI want to share you one of my personal situation. I have been diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis in April 2014. I’ve already gone through several cycles of drug therapy, as well as the possibility of surgery, and at that time I had become a cancer patient in my heart. My life and I were not the same for a year and a half.\nI can not live a normal life, the ability to go out hiking with friends and family, I spent all my free time at doctors because the medication I was taking took longer to make the effect of making the symptoms appear.\nI was not the same person as before.\nA few days ago, something that made my heart beat happily was mentioned. The topic of the discussion is that pulmonary sarcoidosis disease can be cured.\nIf I were to be so happy about this and to be able to share all the good news with all the sarcoidosis lovers and caregivers. Sarcoidosis can be cured. This is a disease that has puzzled and confused the medical field. How is it possible to be cured of a disease that is supposed to be an incurable disease?\nThis is a disease that is now very common but very difficult to treat and unfortunately, not all people infected with her cancer will need a cure. But fortunately, not so few people infected with the sarcoidosis need a cure. They are very lucky too, now there are many kinds of treatments to cure it, and they do not make them suffer for long with the symptoms.\nHowever, although it can be cured, but there are several people who are in a state of not being able to cure their sarcoidosis diseases even though the disease is in the early stages or even in its very early stage.\nIs a disease that does not need to be cured in those who have a cure that does not cure them, but the fact is that people who have received a cure, and they have found that they still need one is not only because the disease has not cured but there are those whose bodies are not responding to the treatment or in other words, their bodies have an immune system that makes it difficult to cure, which causes the ineffectiveness of the drug treatment.\nBut those treated and still needing a cure should not despair because there will be an effective treatment for any other person with sarcoidosis disease.\nSome of the treatments are given as injections, some are taken by pills, and some are taken in drops. So just keep trying this disease, and one day you will find its cure.\nPosted in Cure SarcoidosisTagged cure sarcoidosis, how do i get cure sarcoidodes cure sarcoidosis, how to cure sarcoidosis in 365 days, how to cure sarcoidosis problem without surgery, sarcoidosis, sarcoidosis alternative treatment, sarcoidosis cause, sarcoidosis cure alternative treatment, sarcoidosis disease symptoms, sarcoidosis definition and treatment, sarcoidosis is, sarcoidosis symptoms and diagnosis, sarcoidosis treatment\nWhat Is A Good Diet For Lupus Patients\nLupus Disease"

        "output": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence? If so, I don't see how it can be anything. Rational beliefs can be either true or false as far as I know. You can't just have what is \"true\" or \"false\" you have to have some kind objective evidence or something. Or some non-objective evidence that is sufficient to make the beliefs rational and true.\nThe answer to your question is yes, you can have rational, but subjective beliefs that are true and false and it can make sense. That's all I'm saying.\nI think they are completely subjective. For example, let's say I saw an angel on Monday and then on Tuesday I saw something else, then Tuesday night on Tuesday night I saw a ghost I don't know what it is, but some nights I have dreams that come true too.\nSo it may be subjective, but if we do actually believe it, then we must prove it somehow.\nSubjective is what we subjectively believe but doesn't make it untrue. People like the word objective too much and don't believe in reality. There is no objective evidence for the supernatural, but there are subjective belief and experiences that may explain why people believe.\nSubjective beliefs are those that are based on how we experience the world, rather than on absolute, independent truths. There is objective truth, but people often believe things with strong emotion even if they don’t really make sense. People can make decisions that are irrational from a reasonable point of view, for example they might eat food that they know is bad for them. They may believe something that contradicts rational understanding of the world. For example, people may believe in god, or in a conspiracy theory, or that astrology works, or that the government is planning to kill the population of the world. In other words, it’s subjective to believe in anything. Subjective knowledge is very unreliable; it’s easily influenced. Subjective knowledge doesn’t have a good foundation. Subjective knowledge is a belief, but it’s rational because it’s reasonable and it can’t be proven wrong. Subjective knowledge is knowledge that arises from subjective experience and the world that we experience.\nFor example, in the UK, many people believe that there are many secret agencies like The Illuminati who run the world from behind the scenes. People believe this because of what they observe in their everyday life. They see people talking about different secret agencies and groups in conversation with each other, and there's some strange things happening in the world that can't be completely explained.\nIt's also subjective belief when you think something is good for you even though science says it's bad for you. For example, some people say that alcohol is an anti-oxidant. Of course, that one isn't true, even though they believe it. People also believe that drinking alcohol every day is good for their health. However, a doctor would tell them that they're wrong and that drinking alcohol will do them more harm than good. Subjective beliefs can be true or false, too, of course.\nSubjective knowledge is sometimes also called a personal point of view. There's also the concept of subjective reality, which is defined as the real world as it is experienced by the person or culture experiencing it; their interpretation of it. Subjective reality is sometimes also called a subjective interpretation of reality.\nWhat is knowledge that you would say you know for sure that is true?\nIs knowledge based on our subjective beliefs or is it based on truth, is it based on something that is…"

How about the one I really want you to be interested in for yourself? The one is what I said previously, was brand relevance. And it's all about that brand and customer fit.\nSo for example, here's this category, \"Customer satisfaction\". I guess they're using that. But here's another category that we put in there. \"Recommend the product to a friend\", and we think this is relevant. If somebody recommends a product to a friend or colleague, it's going to be relevant. Well, I'll tell you the one that's going to be really relevant. \"Avoid the product\", \"Complain about the product\", \"Raise a complaint\". They become really relevant. Whenever you've got a brand like this which has some issues with brand relevance, as the customer demands, you have some issues.\nOkay? So brand relevance is important. It's important because it's going to influence your choice of a vendor. It's not the number of categories on the left or the right. It is the categories, and the branding, that you should be using in order to influence you to go to a specific product. This is not a tech choice. This is a customer choice. Yes?\nSpeaker: Oh, yes. That's why I'm asking. It means?\nSpeaker: Well, in order to make a decision you could use all the categories that you'd like. Well, this doesn't necessarily mean that that is the most effective way, or the most efficient way to look at things. What we're trying to do is say, \"Instead of just having a tech vendor, think about the vendor you want. You think about the product itself\". And you go through it, and you ask yourself, \"Is the product right? Does it fit? Do I believe it's going to make a difference for me? And do I like this thing?\".\nSo all that, the tech categories, the marketing categories, are used to influence the decisions you make, but you're actually making decisions on a more strategic level. And that's why the categories you pick to evaluate something are so critical.\nAll right? Thanks for your questions and your comments.\n\"I would have liked to have heard more about how to differentiate our offering from our competitors’ offerings. I wasn’t sure what to focus on as we are offering a similar set of solutions as our competitors, so any advice for standing out would be appreciated.\"\nI think that's a very important question. In our industry, there's a lot of emphasis on the technology, and I'm going to give you some more. I'm sure all of us in this industry have found the problem that our customers don't always understand what the technology is about. And I'm going to give you some examples that come to mind.\nOne of the best examples is the word \"cloud\" itself. It's the hot buzzword of the day. It became a buzzword. And the same thing happened to things like \"Big Data\", \"Social\", \"Community\", any of these phrases you can think of. So you have a problem there today. Cloud is being commoditized. Everything you do is about solving this problem. The issue is this: you can be very good and you can give your customers very large savings in terms of their own total cost of ownership.

I'm not a fan of giving bounties out like candy to heroes. I like to make them work for their treasure and I'm not going to give them all the information they need to know right off the get go.\nLovecraft in D&D was and is about the horrors of the unknown and the things man should not seek to know or understand. Even when the characters aren't explicitly running afoul of the ancient ones, there's still a sense of dread and impending doom. My players didn't care for \"taking out\" the Thuggish Ogrillith and the Ogrillith got a new power and grew, became what she was. She'll be a force in the story. And yes there will be more horror and more terror and more tension. I love playing this game and writing about it.\nYep, I still get in my car and drive around. I still get into it with folks. When all else fails, punch them in the throat. It helps a lot.\nI'd definitely go with the 1st option.\nWhen I make a ruling I'm going for balance rather than \"that sounds cool\" factor. That said there's nothing in these rules that would prevent what you are talking about.\nMost all of my players are roleplaying and doing an excellent job. When we do the NPC's we go through the process of deciding what information players receive and what not. My players are working with our homebrew. They ask, \"can I go to the library and find out about ... \" and the DM is \"Yep.\" So it's not about power checks or the need for them, my players ask and I run with what they decide. If my players don't want to take that chance or want the information, my ruling is \"yes, that's a fun idea, you can find out from X.\" When they ask or decide to ask about a certain location? Not \"Yep\" for sure. One of my players is a rogue, and when she asks about getting into a location in our home base city I go \"Yeah, pretty sure they'll let you in.\" I think a good example of what I'm talking about was with the Yugoloth. The players tried to run around it and run away, but the DM had the Yugoloth pursue them and finally caught up to them after several days of running back and forth. The players got tired of doing that and wanted to meet it face to face. The DM said, \"Okay, I'm going to roll initiative for both the Yugoloth and the party.\" The party went second. The DM rolled 18 dice, came up with an 18, and killed them. My players and I agreed to it because we knew they weren't ready. As soon as they were prepared for it they came up to the DM, \"Let's do it again.\" And we did. They didn't run, and they faced off with the monster. And while it didn't work out for them in the end, in the process of fighting it they learned something, they got information, about the Yugoloth that nobody else knows. And they've been fighting it ever since. My players and I don't put things in the players' hands for them to fail or not. If we know the players are ready for whatever, we let them go at it.\nI got these at Cool Stuff Games, and they're superb. I love them, I think the players at my table love them, too.\nThe reason I posted what I posted was because you're asking for the \"correct\" ruling. You have to figure out for yourself what's right for your game and characters. The rules are there for you to decide for yourself. I do not post \"corrections\" to the DM unless the DM and players decide together that it's been wrong in the past and it needs to be corrected and then I'll adjust it to my taste. All I can do is run my game by my own rules and my own rules say that it's ok for the DC of a decipher device to be 5 or 10"

The punch line is just a short hand form of what happens in your family?

It looks like someone punched you\" A little like that. Let's get some \"punch lines\" started in my own little family. I know that I want to go to town and play a Christmas musical (Christmas Carol) with all my family. And with a Punch line I just say I love that show and I am going to take the day off to do that. 1 . The Punch Line would be that is what I am going to do in the New Year. 2 . The Punch Line would be: I am going to build my own website in the new year with some of my free time and this is what I am going to focus on. 3 . The Punch Line would be how do you feel and how we should all feel in the new year? I feel great how about? That is the new years punch line: feel great. 4 . The Punch Line would be: If you are not happy in the new year you should get some help to be happy and learn how to smile. 5 . The Punch Line would be: in the New Year I am going to take charge of my own happiness and see what is the real reason for my lack of happiness in the new year? 6 .

The Punch Line would be: I am going to exercise in the new year with my family, it will make a nice bonding time we think? 8 . The Push Line would be I am going to exercise in the next year to get in the best shape of my life? and that is my new years punch line? 9 . The Push Line would be I am going to eat in the new year and eat healthy foods and lose a few pounds to feel better in the new year? and that is my new years punch line? 10 . The Push Line would be I am going to find new and fun hobbies to do with my family in the next year and that is my new years punch line. These punch lines in my family are short hand for the things we are going to do for the next year. It is just a quick way to say, \"This is what I am going to focus on in the new year.\" Then you just say, \"This is what I am going to focus on in the new year.\" It is just so much easier to think that to say it out loud. \"Tell me what you want to focus on in your own family life in the new year?\" \"Tell me what you would like to focus on in your own family life in the new year?\" So these punch line ideas are really very good for you and should bring you what you focus on in the new year.

I have no problem with someone needing to get somewhere and they aren’t worried about causing a crash by cutting in, but I draw the line with aggravated, dangerous, or deliberate driving style that makes it harder for people behind me to see or makes it more likely that I’m going to get into an accident.\nI’ve had many experiences like this, but the last encounter I hope to never see again is the one I had the last time I went to buy gas. I pulled up to the pump and the very kind attendant (because I’ve never had an issue getting a friendly, helpful person) came over to greet me and gave me my receipt. As I was turning around, I noticed there was another driver trying to back into a spot between another car and my truck, but he wasn’t having any luck. He was trying to turn into the middle of the spot, so obviously, he was not going to make it. But, he kept fumbling around trying, and his car was blocking part of the road.

        "output": "Can a qualifying manager work remotely abroad for US employer for an year be eligible for Eb1-C while on h1-b? Yes, they can. In a case where a US employer can hire a manager from a country outside the US, if the H1 visa holder is eligible enough to be a manager by US standards, he/she must have a managerial position within their US employer and should be employed in the US for more than 50% of the time to be counted as a qualifying manager. In the rare case when a foreign manager does not have enough time in US to count as a qualifying manager because they work outside US for employer who is a different company, they may be eligible to get a qualifying manager for their US employer’s second company. 5. Can a foreign-born manager who gets a green card under Eb1 C do any type of work? Yes, although they have to file an additional form called an intent to apply after becoming a permanent resident, they must work for the same US employer or a subsidiary under the control of their US employer after they become a permanent resident. 6. Can an employer get green cards for managers through an eb1-b for individual managers as well as through an eb2 or eb3-National visa for foreign national managers who do not qualify for an eb1 or eb2 for individual managers? A foreign born manager can get a green card through an eb1 for individual foreign born managers who meet the job requirements, or through the eb2-National for managers who do not meet the requirement of the job requirements for an eb1. An employer can also file an eb3 or eb1 for managers from outside US who do not qualify as eb1 or eb2 for individual managers. This type of green card application has more back and forth with the Immigration department before the permanent resident status is approved and would only apply where a manager would have to be employed by an employer but would also be able to work for the company when its is not a core employment function of the managers job. 7. Are there any special benefits in H1B visas for a US corporation that has one or more foreign-born managers? No, only one US company at a time can sponsor a work visa for US immigration purposes. There may be one exception where is called concurrent filing, which is where more than one US corporation can join hands with the US manager to file a green card application for him/her. In the current administration, there is also an exception where the US corporation must get authorization from the department of labor before filing any green card application. An exception to this would be if an H1B sponsor for the US corporation has an exceptional ability worker’s petition (EB-2) pending at the time the manager is sponsored by the US company to apply for a work visa. It is therefore extremely critical that the H1B sponsoring US company properly and accurately comply with US department of labor’s H1B filing requirements, including proof of EB-2 approval or authorization to file. If the US company fails to meet this requirement, the US department of labor may deny the request to change the status from H1B to immigrant visa and prevent the foreign-born manager from working in the United States in any capacity while the request is pending. 8. What are the major drawbacks of the eb1-C? The major drawbacks are that qualifying managers do not require a minimum number of years experience or a specialized educational background to be counted as qualifying manager. Most managers would have to first go through the labor certification process to work under the Eb-2 category which is a more lengthy process. The Eb-1C category is also less flexible than the eb-2 category for which a more in-depth analysis is needed to see if a particular foreign-born manager is eligible under either category. The foreign-born manager must work in a managerial capacity in the US or aboard for US employers to qualify under this category. This means they must work for the US employer, or a separate foreign branch, subsidiary or affiliate of the US employer in the US or aboard for US employer. 9. How can an US employer hire a foreign-born employee as a manager abroad and who can do all the work abroad for US clients with only H1B visa to be in US for 3-6months for any particular project? A foreign-born employee can receive H1B and H4 visas for project-based work in the United States as long as the employer can demonstrate that they would not be"

        "instruction": "I have competencies in remote sensing, machine learning, and water resource knowledge, what are the possible jobs I can occupy? What are the possible projects I can do? What companies I can work at?",
        "output": "I have competencies in remote sensing, machine learning, and water resource knowledge, what are the possible jobs I can occupy? What are the possible projects I can do? What companies I can work at?\nIn terms of the jobs, remote sensing, machine learning, water resource all fall under the same general category. So it's fine if you have competencies in all of them, the company you're going to work at does not need to limit you only to one specialization but can use all the skills for better results. So once you know how to get into that field and the company you're applying to and the project, then you can apply for that.\nWhat are some key differences between working at a private company versus in academia versus government, etc.?\nThe main difference is about ownership of data. For example, if you work for a private company that owns the data, you must protect that data, you cannot copy the data or publish it openly without their consent. In academia on the other hand, you are not bound by the company guidelines, you can share the data as much as you want as long as your university or government approves it.\nIn government, the data belongs to the government, and they could change ownership of the data over time. For example, NASA can use public and private data to study. I just want to say that there are many things in these different organizations, it is important for you to know which type you'd like to work with because they’re all very different and have different requirements.\nWhat is an intern, how can one get into them, and how can one get them outside of the U.S.?\nThe one big difference for interns in the U.S. and those in other countries is that here in the U.S., you're doing the work for your university and not for a company. So interns in the U.S. are not paid here, they're basically doing work like interns that are not paid. If you get an internship in the U.S., you're working for your school, and that's okay.\nWhat is an internship/job like at NASA?\nYou're working in a specific part of NASA according to the projects. There are different types of projects you can work on, depending on the requirements we can develop the project for you. So if you want a specific project on your thesis, let’s say an aerosol study on Mars. As you have seen earlier, the aerosol project that's being done now requires a team that includes a remote sensing person, machine language, computer hardware, computer programming, and others. So by doing this, we’re trying to open a lot of job opportunities for everyone including the government contractors outside NASA. For example, if you're a graduate, you can work in NASA as a project manager, to open the job opportunities.\nHow do you find a thesis project to work on?\nI just want to say that there are a lot of thesis research projects, especially for remote sensing, machine learning, and water resource. You can research one and you can have your thesis done, but it only needs to be finished at the end of May so it needs to be completed in 1.5 months. So if you have a thesis for your course, it takes maybe 2 months to finish, then the rest of your time during this semester, you're free to work on your thesis. But you need to communicate with me because, you know, I’m working with other students and companies so I already have projects lined up for them. My email is [email protected] We can communicate so that I can give you some of my projects and you can have the chance to join my projects. And you can start doing the work. You're working with me, you are part of my team along with my Ph.D. students, so you can get lots of experience. The projects aren't only one-time, but you can continue to work on it also for 1-2 years. That's an advantage.\nSo if you have a project already but you don't have enough time, feel free to get in communication with me and we can discuss about the project, which students will work on which.\nYou brought up the possibility of being a project manager for a company, how can one go about acquiring/establishing such a position? What would be some qualities of a good project manager?\nProject management is not only for projects at NASA but other things like at the private company. The most important thing is knowing about the work you do, but at the same time, you're talking with the people who need it, that is your manager. You will see that a project manager in a company"

But, it still imports 50% of its oil. Energy prices are continuing to rise. We’ve used virtually all of the natural resources at our disposal. Therefore, we need to conserve energy (energy we don’t use is energy we don’t pay for).\n12 Why is Energy Conservation Important? (cont.)\nGlobal Climate Change Carbon dioxide is responsible for approximately ¾ of all greenhouse emissions. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, a type of gas. These gases affect global warming or cooling. Greenhouse gases are known as “insulation” for the atmosphere. When the amount of greenhouse gas is increased, the atmosphere becomes less insulation, so the world becomes warmer. Global Warming is when the average surface temperature of the earth rises. This is called “Global Warming” because of the changes in temperature in the earth’s surface. The earth in general is getting warmer. Average surface temperatures have risen 1 º and about ½ of that rise has occurred in the last 20 years. Increasing Temperatures: Increasing temperatures is likely to affect the polar climate most. Average temperatures in the far north and far south are rising about twice as fast as average temperatures in mid latitudes, such as the United States. Sea levels have risen about 8 inches since the late 1800s, and it is likely they will continue to rise at a rate of as much as 3 millimeters a year. The rising oceans will put pressure on the coastlines, contributing to a variety of problems, including increased exposure of shoreline beaches to erosion and flooding.\n13 What Is the United Earth’s Position on Energy Conservation and Global Climate Change?\nThe Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol is a step toward stabilizing greenhouse gas levels and reducing our emissions. The Protocol is targeted at developed countries, with United States being the only developed country to not commit to the agreement. Kyoto Protocol: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol: An agreement made on December 11, by which all developed countries that signed agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 5% below 1990 levels by the year 2012. U.N. FCCC: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate The purpose of this convention is to stabilize the earth’s climate while enhancing its ability to adapt and stabilize greenhouse gas levels and reduce our emissions.\n14 What Is the United States Position on Energy Conservation and Global Climate Change? In 1970, 30% of the gasoline used in the U.S. was imported by the U.S. Currently, this number has risen to over 60% for regular gasoline, and nearly 90% for oxygenated fuels including reformulated gasolines, and winter gasoline. Oil: Oil is a natural resource, and we are rapidly depleting this resource. There is now a finite amount of oil left. We can either let its reserves dwindle or we can keep the oil that we’ve got left. Energy Conservation: Energy conservation refers to the reduction of energy. It can include the conservation of all of the energy resources consumed in the United States but is more typically directed at energy from oil, gas, and electricity. Energy conservation can: Increase demand Reduce supply Minimize importation Reduce energy costs\n16 Fossil Fuel Fossil Fuel: The fuel of a power station: Coal, oil, natural gas.

Then do a searchable version of your patent filed with us.\n\nIt makes easy for people to read your patent which helps them to understand and know what is your invention about.\n\nComment: I've edited the question slightly to try to make it more clear. However, it remains unclear to me how a blockchain or encryption technology can make it easier to create verifiable credentials.\n\nComment: This sounds like a decentralized way of creating the same verifiablity of identities. I mean, even in a centralized identity verification system, verbs can be hacked. A blockchain with decentralized ledgers (ie: nodes) are much harder to hack because they would have to hack every ledger on the entire blockchain to get information from it. This makes it incredibly unlikely due to the cost. They would have to do the same things as if they hacked the centralized identity, only without an external source to attack.\n\nComment: @DJCrshn I updated my answer. What do you think? Still unclear, is it more clear now?\n\nComment: This is quite interesting. I think it is clear that you are a blockchain expert. I can see how applying blockchain technology to identity management in the context of the tax collector would be a novel and innovative way of doing that. My guess is that this is something that is likely to be useful, and the tax collector might even be required to adopt it by some future government. But I'm not a tax law lawyer.\n\nAnswer: In terms of patents, the question is what is novel. The first place you need to look is the prior art:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Check if similar techniques or approaches are being used somewhere else in the world now.\n\\item Is there similar or better ways of achieving what you want?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIf the answer to either is yes, your proposal has issues.\n\nI suggest working your idea out on an example from real life where you could use your idea to achieve a novel benefit.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item How would you do it?\n\\item What issues would be there?\n\\item What does the \"novel\" thing you propose do better?\n\\item What would the advantages be?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWith that, you'll have a more detailed, comprehensible patent application and also have a chance to show the possible benefits of a patent. This is important because although a patent is a legally binding document, it also acts to promote and encourage the development of your specific technology.\n\nGood luck!\n\nComment: I don't think \"tax certificate\" or \"identity credential\" are good titles for the invention, though. I think it would be better to call something where it does something \"useful\" with it.\n\nComment: @DJCrshn yeah, that's really a matter of opinion in the end with regards to what the patent application/invention is.\n\nAnswer: It's possible that the answer to your question may lie in the [patent-eligibility](https://ipwatchdog.com/2018/10/20/patentability-determined-prior-art-post-issuance-review-patentability-determined-prior-art) rules.  (Courts may not reach this question until [September 2019](https://www.axiomspace.com/blog/post/a-view-to-september-2017-interim-guidelines-on-patent-eligibility-issued-by-the-us-patent-alice-issue-proceeds-accelerating-court-decisions)).\n\nThere might be other ways to patent novel use of blockchain technology.  But as you've figured out, blockchain and cryptography as such are not novel.  For cryptography, you have to look beyond plain encryption and key protection to patent novel encryption methods, and you have to demonstrate that they are novel.

        "output": "How can L’Hopital’s Rule be used in day to day life? The simplest answer to this question is that it cannot. It will never work, is never, and will never be used in the real world, not for the life of anyone. How does this make sense? What a silly idea! Obviously the rule has a very specific purpose and use – solving the ratio of exponential variables, such as those that arise when dealing with population growth. When it comes down to it, L’Hopital’s Rule is simply a very specific calculation tool, intended for very specific scenarios. The fact that people are being taught, and are believing that this rule can be used during a calculus exam, is shocking and absolutely ludicrous (and as a teacher, this makes my blood boil). It is also, in my personal opinion, just down right terrifying to think that such a dangerous situation could exist in the academic world, without even a single soul to speak up against it. 175.45 19.20%3.35%4.80%4.15%5.90%6.65%7.40%8.25%9.10%10.00%10.90%11.85%12.80%13.70%3298140001672000Math Calculations719.24 –4.35%5.89%4.54%2.23%3.69%0.10%0.99%202040658120mathcalculations.com294.28 –5.95%5.10%3.51%2.07%3.125744000000000311571Math Calculations98.18 –1.72%2.30%3.74%3.22%4.54%4.79%71.935663000000003249132mathcalculations.com90120mathcalculations.com778.84 –2.22%4.40%5.15%2.10%1.73%2.975744000000000689966mathcalculations.com92350000mathcalculations.com981.88 –1.64%2.74%4.80%2.88%3.78%3.025744000000000506500mathcalculations.com994000mathcalculations.com955.92 –0.58%2.26%3.85%3.14%2.92%1.86mathcalculations.com10065000mathcalculations.com1014000mathcalculations.com101720mathcalculations.com0202000mathcalculations.com100771.42028 -1952.9409 -8350178.62486 -16245.304162 -1634082.25 -1453602.526 -523696.405 -3051828.958 -13045038.27 -32095672.385 -95670029.68 -66619419023 -9796884.973 -110428017.99168 -7890748.351 -16816658586 -121398050.995 -3072780061.0076 -7008471920.077 -27064365380.91 -393180573719.00 -116153272435.0226 -2"

        "output": "Who made Berlin the city that it became? I’m glad you asked! It was the British! No, seriously, it was the Brits!\nI am not going to get into “Who made Wembley,” but let it be known that Wembley Stadium was built by the Brits for the Brits. And the Brits for that matter. (The USA, Canada and Australia all contributed as well. Shout out to you all).\nSo it was only fitting that I had this German-British fusion of a day at the pub to end the festivities! The last stop on our tour of historical pubs was the New Globe Theatre. Not only did we get a tour of the theatre, we got to meet some of the actors who play a part in the historic pub.\nThe Globe Theatre opened in 1969 and is a reconstruction of the original Globe Theatre from 1599-1614. It is a registered historic site and has been used as an operating theatre since the 1960’s. It is also the home of the King’s Head Choir – an acting choir that is the only group allowed to perform at the New Globe Theatre. The choir consists of the actors, singers and dancers of the New Globe Theatre.\nAfter our tour of the theatre, a small group of us met up with some of the actors for dinner. We met up at The George Inn for some drinks before dinner. The George Inn used to be a pub where theatre-goers could purchase a ticket to see a performance at the Globe theatre. They used to sit in the back courtyard and cheer on the actors on stage. Fun fact: You can still get a round of drinks and some bar bites in that back courtyard today.\nThe George Inn was also where Shakespeare and his actors would gather when they were not performing for the King of England.\nThe George Inn also got a tour from us!\nAfter drinks at the George Inn, we headed to The Queen’s Head for dinner. I know the name seems familiar, that’s because it’s the same place the Prince of Wales (King George IV/Prince Regent/Prince Consort of Queen Victoria) had his stag night before he married the Princess of Wales. That’s why we chose the place for dinner.\nAnd since it was our farewell party, of course we had to have a bit of fun and have a keg of beer brought in!\nAfter dinner and drinks at The Queen’s Head we headed back to the hotel to rest up for the next day of touring. Which we did in the morning and then headed up to the rooftop for my “farewell party” with my new friends. We ate a farewell brunch of eggs, crispy bacon, smoked salmon, and french toast stuffed with bananas and topped off with nutella and bacon sauce. Sounds pretty good right?\nWell it was. It was also the BEST farewell party EVER!\nMy “fake fiancé” even came in the morning to pick me up in his cute little beetle! What did we do all day? Lunch in a beer garden (you can see the taps behind my date). Followed by a little pub crawl where we snuck in to check out the rooftop at Stork Café. Stork Café will be rebuild as one of the most sustainable buildings in Europe. The Stork Café is famous for having a rooftop bar (which we were not able to access on this tour) and is supposedly a great place to people watch.\nWe also snuck into a pub in Prenzlauer Berg called Das Lokal where our tour guide told us to try the baked goods there! (He was right, it was delish)! Our tour guide also took us for a little walk of his favorite haunts around this part of the city near the Spree Canal. It was also a favorite among the 1970 punk movement in East Germany. If you look closely, you may notice some of the same buildings that were around in 1970 are still there.\nWe took a little break in the mid-afternoon and grabbed coffee and kuchen at a little café. (Which translates to “coffee and cake”). Perfect end to the day before heading back for a final farewell dinner.\nAnd I couldn’t let the trip go by without getting some pictures of these crazy cats I had been hanging out with all week. They are literally my soul mates. A little bit of this kitty is in"

        "output": "Reply to all messages with a malbolge program that prints the correct response. At least not with the standard malbolge syntax.\nHowever, with the -b command this isn't as easy as one would think. If you enter the command \"cat\" you would expect to see the string \"cat\". But using the \"-b\" flag will change the output into the string \"cat\". Unfortunately, we can't detect the difference between \"cat\" and \"car\".\nHowever, the code is only partially correct. Because of the way malbolge interprets the -b flag we can't know whether the string is \"cat\" or \"car\". The -b mode just adds a 1 to the last character, so it prints \"cat\" regardless of its contents.\nThere is a way to print \"cat\", at least when no additional strings are passed as input.\nThe command \"echo\" is interpreted as \"433243\"; in this case there are four 3-bit words, each of which contain two bytes: \"43\" and \"32\". The string \"cat\", however, contains a byte and a word, both of which start with \"4\", so in reality it's translated into \"4\".\nNow we have a way to tell apart \"cat\" and \"car\" from the command output. But we want to keep the advantage that \"cat\", \"car\" and \"foobar\" all print out the same thing, and that it's possible to print a string without any spaces.\nThe last command allows us to do all that we want. It prints the string \"foobar\" with the last byte translated into the byte \"4\".\nThe above example only works with input strings of length 5 or less. For larger strings we can create a larger command string of 34 bits that will only print \"1293\" for \"foobar\".\nWe didn't find a way to print the number 123 with the -b command. What you'll need to do to get an approximate value of what we're trying to do is to look at the example code, and see a way around the problem.\nIt's almost a shame that malbolge is restricted to print at most 5 bit values. However, it does make the whole process easier for the compiler to do."

Reply to the following question from the imaginary world:\nWhat the most effective ways to commit tax fraud in the United Steaks of America?\nWhile you may be tempted to claim your home as a hotel for the year, remember that this will raise a red flag with the Internal Revenue Service and your neighbor will have lots more pork to talk about at their Sunday brunch.\nInstead, take the money out of the country as part of an investment program. Of course, you’ll have to put your fake wife and kid though.\nI recommend that you claim you are an international business consultant, and make your first stop in New York. Then continue on to Switzerland to open an investment account. At that point you can begin investing in the Steaks of America.\nIf your wife and kid are up for a trip, then why not claim to be in New York for the week, and you can visit with family while you’re at it? Just be sure to spend a good chunk of money while in Switzerland. Otherwise this will be an easy investigation for the IRS.\nThen head over to Europe and back again. You’ll be set up with a hotel in Paris when things finally wrap up. Make the most of your time away in the United Steaks of America.\nWednesday, Nov 29, 2017, 9:36pm\nIf the tax auditors take you, they can’t take it with them.\nI would get a fake passport in a country that wouldn’t vet it and then travel to the United States. I would then set up a bank account in, say, Arizona, while traveling to a few of the U.S. territories that allow US residency.\nI would then start depositing money and transferring money back and forth while claiming to run a consulting firm.\nAfter a few months of building your fake business and tax profile, you would then take a brief trip to one of the territories with your fake family. From there, the auditors would have trouble as they’ll assume you went overseas while building your business in the United States.\nIt might also look fishy if your wife and kids weren’t living abroad and/or didn’t take part in your “consulting” firm.\nSurely, not using a passport in a country like Canada, Australia or the UK could raise eyebrows. Remember, Canada is part of the USA and we are all so patriotic.\nYou also need to be living in the United States to claim taxes there. Even if this doesn’t flag red, an audit would at least require a good explanation, at considerable time and expense.\nYou should check out this great site, www.shrinkflasterberg.com. They’ll go through all the technical steps, set up proper bookkeeping, and all the rest.\nThese services cost a small fortune, so it might well be worth paying a cut of profits – maybe 25% or so.\nWhat’s the correct tax percentage for a business that makes no real profits but has a low salary and a lot of overhead?\nTo get out of paying taxes as a consultant you’d have to show that you’re spending 100% or your time working on consulting gigs for clients. That means you need to work for clients at a rate of $100 an hour.\nWhich, let’s be honest, no one does on consulting gigs.\nA consulting company should pay taxes, as it is a “business” entity.\nIt is actually a service contractor and is being paid by the customer, just like a plumber, electrician, or caterer. If the consultant doesn’t pay taxes, the customer should also not pay taxes.\nYou need to be paid to do something specific.\nWhat’s the proper tax percentage in a country that’s not the USA?\nThat’s a great question, and I had to do a bit of Googling to get a good answer. First, you will need to determine how many days you were away from home for work.\nHere’s the good news: if you have a passport with multiple entries from multiple countries, you only have to worry about where you spent more than 183 days in a calendar year. If you are a resident of the USA, that means you can spend most of the year in Canada, or any of several European countries, and avoid paying taxes on that income.\nOn the other"

        "output": "which libraries are the best for developing deep learning scripts in python?\nAny suggestions for this? Thanks!\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-deep-learning-in-a-week\nThere are many excellent resources available for those wanting to learn the basics of DL. As for a one week schedule, I generally recommend going through one of the online courses such as Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera or Sebastian Thrun’s AI course on Udacity (see related discussion on https://forums.fast.ai/).\nHow does deep learning use and apply artificial neural networks?\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-does-deep-learning-use-and-apply-artificial-neural-networks\nArtificial neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms that utilize mathematical operations on an input to compute a numerical result.\nThe first artificial neural networks were based in single computational unit, called nodes, often referred to as artificial neurons. Each node takes in as its input a vector of data, e.g. x1, x2,…, xN, which can be numerical, categorical, ordinal, etc. and computes the result y=f(x). Nodes connect between each other and the output nodes provide the outputs to the system.\nSince neural networks can be very expensive to train, they often are augmented by methods called regularizers which provide a constraint on the parameters of the network which are estimated (or learned) during training. As such, they can provide the same kind of constraints as statistical methods, or provide direct constraints on the parameters like graphical models. For example, L1 regularization penalizes very long path lengths between nodes in the network, ensuring that the input is represented in only a few nodes.\nIn addition, many neural networks learn both a representation of the data (the input to the network) and a transformation to the data. These methods are often called deep learning or hierarchical deep networks as they employ repeated use of these methods, often referred to as neural networks, to define multi-level representations of the data.\nWhy is deep learning so popular when a lot of these algorithms have been around for many years (eigenfaces, Haar features, SIFT)?\nhttps://www.quora.com/Why-is-deep-learning-so-popular-when-a-lot-of-these-algorithms-have-been-around-for-many-years-eigenfaces-Haar-features-SIFT\nEven though these algorithms have been around, the improvements in computational power over the years, in particular the improved memory capacity and the improved access to parallel processing resources have made these algorithms work better than before.\nAre deep learning techniques based on neural networks or just supervised learning?\nhttps://www.quora.com/Are-deep-learning-techniques-based-on-neural-networks-or-just-supervised-learning\nhttps://www.quora.com/Are-deep-learning-techniques-based-on-neural-networks-or-just-supervised-learning/answer/Andrew-Lazarow\nDepends on how you define them. In general deep learning is a class of techniques for training deep neural nets. There are dozens of types of neural nets (e.g. long short term memory, GAN, etc). These techniques are often referred to as deep learning algorithms for this reason.\nSome of them however (sparse autoencoders, deep belief networks), while they are neural nets, are more specifically a style of supervised learning as there is no optimization involved.\nIn particular, deep reinforcement learning is perhaps the most active area at the moment, but still uses supervised and reinforcement learning techniques to make the agents learn.\nHow does a data scientist or machine learning expert get started with deep learning?\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-does-a-data-scientist-or-machine-learning-expert-get-started-with-deep-learning\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-does-a-data-scientist-or-machine-learning-expert-get-started-with-deep-learning/answer/Andrew-Lazarow\nThere are many excellent resources available that cover machine learning and deep learning in general.\nMy personal recommendation is to follow a MOOC on these subjects, e.g. Coursera Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course, Udacity Sebastian Thrun’s AI course, or other specialized courses.

When it comes to business, though, the success of being able to present is something that we all need to learn. A pitch is more than just a presentation; it is an opportunity to prove your business capabilities to investors, clients, partners, and other interested parties. Your pitch should be focused around your business idea and what it will contribute to the community and the world as a whole. Your focus should be on making your pitch a presentation that captivates your audience and makes them want to join your cause. When it comes to making your pitch presentation, there are three major pieces of the puzzle. Each of these areas plays a role in the success of your pitch, so it is important to pay careful attention to them. 1. What is the overall goal or objective? When making your pitch, there are generally three different ways that the overall objective can go. The primary objective is to get people excited about the product or service offered in the presentation. The secondary objective is to provide people with an overall understanding of the product or service. The tertiary objective is to motivate your audience’s emotions about the product or service and let them know about the benefits they will receive if they choose to work with you. 2. Who is your target market audience? Determining who your target market is, who your marketing team must focus on, and who needs to be involved in making your pitch is vital to the success of your product or service. Your market audience is the one that you need to persuade and convince that your product or service has value. 3. What are your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses? The competitive environment within your market is a major factor in what makes your product or service unique, as well as what makes it successful. You must understand your competitive environment and the value that your competitors offer to a segment of the market. If your competitors offer your product or service at a lower price, you must determine how you can compete in the marketplace and offer something that"

        "output": "How would a basic project in PyGame look like? I'd like the example to include keyboard event handling so that pressing ESC will quit the game and also print the FPS counter in the left top corner of the window. As far as the game loop is concerned there should be only one place that starts the timer and updates the game (maybe I'll do it in the init function but don't know yet). Also the game should exit when the user presses the ESC key, preferably with an alert to remind the user to not quit by accident. As you probably already know this is going to involve three functions, two of which I'll introduce here. PyGame.init() This function is called at the beginning of each game loop. It's responsible for setting up the game and doing game specific initialization. Here's the PyGame init function: import pygame as pg c = pg the main window is displayed on pg.display.set_mode(), that is PyGame sets up the window size, the background color and the display mode for our window (1280 by 720). The background colour of the window is set to 80 by 50, that's the colour that will be painted by most other functions. the font used is set to 40 and the fps counter is drawn in the top left corner (with the font \"Impact\" which is found in the fonts folder under \"pygame\"). Finally we set up the fullscreen mode in display. set_mode(1280, 720), which will paint everything in our window in black by default, which we can then modify with other drawing functions. Here is the finished PyGame init function: As you know we initialize the pygame and display module and then call the PyGame init function, which in the turn will paint the background with the colours mentioned above. It also shows a timer which increments each frame and the fps counter in the corner. The fps counter is incremented only if the frame rate is above 30 frames per second, below that the counter is set to zero. There is also a small function print_fps() that prints the current fps rate from turn to turn for the PyGame init function. Because everything has been defined in a single function PyGame init there is only one place where this has to be defined. I've tested this extensively by just repeating the PyGame.init() function from the other turn and it worked just fine. I guess you could also just assign it to a variable, but I think this way is clearer. And actually this is also a good way to do it, if a game is small it can be repeated in one turn, but if your game is big it is better if functions are reusable and share data so that you don't have to repeat the same function multiple times. So I think this is the best place for a reusable function. print_fps() This function is called in the turn and is responsible for printing the current fps of your game. Here's how I defined it: def print_fps(): global current_fps, frame_rate = 0 for _ in range(60): try: current_fps = frame_rate * 100 pygame.display.flip() frame_rate = pygame.time.tick() if frame_rate > 30: print(\"FPS:\", current_fps) else: print(\"FPS NOT ABOVE 30, EXITING GAME.\") global current_fps, fps_rate = 0 for _ in range(60): try: current_fps = fps_rate * 100 pygame.display.flip() fps_rate = pygame.time.tick() if fps_rate > 30: print(\"FPS:\", current_fps) else: print(\"FPS NOT ABOVE 30, EXITING GAME.\") global current_fps, fps_rate = 0 for _ in range(60): try: current_fps = fps_rate * 100 pygame.display.flip() fps_rate = pygame.time.tick() if fps_rate > 30: print(\"FPS:\", current_fps) else: print(\"FPS NOT ABOVE 30, EXITING GAME.\") global current_fps, fps_rate = 0 for _ in range(60): try: current_fps = fps_rate * 100 pygame.display.flip() fps_rate = pygame.time.tick() if fps_rate > 30: print(\"FPS:\", current_fps) else: print(\"FPS NOT ABOVE"

If so, how were they able to be drawn into a deception like this?\nAnswer: This is an urban myth being bandied about on the internet and no, it isn’t real, how then could they have fallen for a deception like this, the internet is replete with myths, legends and what are now known as urban legends, which are just rumors of the real world that never took place. This rumor about spaghetti growing on trees is akin to a rumor saying that a man was abducted by aliens, you have no proof that this actually happened so why should anyone believe you unless you can back your claim up with facts? And it is quite telling that there is nothing about a man being abducted by aliens in the news, why would there be? This is about a man who was abducted by aliens and there are no such things as aliens, so why would there be such a thing as a news article on it.\nQ: How was I abducted by aliens?\nA: Well you would know better than I because it was you who was abducted and you know best.\nQ: How would I know best if I do not know?\nA: Well you have proof that you were taken aboard an alien ship, they must have taken you aboard an alien ship because of this proof.\nQ: I do not know whether they really took me aboard an alien ship or not?\nA: Of course you know, they must have for you to have proof you were abducted by aliens, they must have done it or it would have never happened.\nQ: How could they ever have taken me aboard an alien ship when they do not exist, you do not even believe in aliens do you?\nA: Of course they exist, it has been proven.\nQ: How has it been proven?\nQ: How could it have been proven?\nA: Didn’t you say you were abducted by aliens?\nQ: You mean an alien abduction happened to me?\nHow do we prove such things? Well some people say that spaghetti trees or alien abductions could be confirmed only by those who were abducted, which might sound believable as I mentioned earlier.\nQ: Well I was abducted and I saw with my very own eyes that there were spaghetti trees, so it must have happened.\nA: Well what did you actually see?\nQ: Well I saw spaghetti being produced at exactly how it appears on the packages, a bunch of green spaghetti being produced like a tree with the trees branches bearing green spaghetti, you know all the branches just produced spaghetti in the package on the tree.\nA: And what do other people who’s eyes have not been abused by alien ray guns say about you claims, you know like people you tell about this? How do they react to it? Do they believe it is really true, is it being believed?\nQ: Well many of my friends do believe me, I could not have been abducted by aliens if my friends don’t believe me, but then again you do not believe me.\nA: Well of course you are wrong in that thought, you may have friends who actually do believe it, but a good percentage of them will not, and they will probably find this story as ridiculous as it really is, not believable and uninteresting, something to be ignored, that is why it is on the internet and not in the newspaper, if it were true to be found in the newspaper it would be in the front pages of the news. Because I know that you know there are no aliens, therefore, a man could not be abducted by them, which means that your story, your alien abduction is not true at all so I could never find it interesting to even listen to unless I had evidence that I might have been abducted by aliens or that I was the one who abducted you, you should have never told me this story of something you have been abducted by aliens and seen spaghetti growing on trees and that is why you believe it is true because of what you saw, because if it were true, it would be in the news and it is not so it is not true.\nQ: But it is really true, I actually was abducted by aliens and they took me aboard an alien ship and there I saw lots of green spaghetti growing on trees and then when I returned to Earth, I saw lots of green sp"

This is the first chapter.\nIt was a day much like today. It was warm that time of year, which meant that the winter was over, and the warmth of spring was yet to fully reveal itself. The sun was out, it was a few days after the first new moon, and yet a full moon would come in four days time. The children were asleep, and their mother was preparing some delicious food for their evening meal. And then, just as the smell of the food permeated the little cottage, just as their mother was about to prepare a meal for the family, the sky turned dark, and a storm was upon them.\nThe thunder was so loud that, at first it sounded more like a cannon than it did like the angry roar of heaven's chariots. The sky lit up like the 4th of July. Their mother knew that the storm was approaching, as a flash of lightning revealed it to be. She knew that, should a tree fall on the cottage, it would bring a quick and painful finish to the family. She tried to wake up the children, but the sound and the light that their mother endured was so harsh that she did not hear her children call. The smell of the food became a distant memory as their mother prepared herself for a quick and painful death. The storm would be here in a minute, all they could do was prepare.\nThose were the thoughts of their mother, the ones that she repeated over and over again, as she prepared herself emotionally for the fact that none of them would be alive after the storm went through. They knew of the dangers. Their father had died in a storm in the woods, that is what they were led to understand. They had been living in this cottage since he died. They had been so happy, with their mother and father and brothers, but the older brothers passed from a terrible disease, and their parents were lost as well. Now they were on their own. All for one, and one for all. Their mother had told them time and time again that they should always strive to be a family in this world, but if the storm came when they were alone, all it would take would be the death of the mother, or both mother and father, or maybe the entire family, and they would never reunite in heaven.\nIt was a storm that they would never forget. The winds were so great that it seemed like the house, which was built from heavy logs, would be blown apart at any time. So they huddled together in a pile in the far corner of the cottage and listened to the ferociousness of the storm outside. The mother held her oldest two, her dear brothers, and her sweetest little baby, the child of her life, and she held them close. She cried out to the heavens. I have never heard such a storm. This is what the world will become, if the storm has us, I pray to you, give us the strength we need, she prayed to the heavens. We will fight for our lives tonight, for we may never again see the sun.\nThe storm was about to be at its worst, and she knew it, she could just sense it. They had just begun to close their eyes, and say their prayers for the night, when she heard a voice in her ear. \"You know, I'm not afraid of a storm, I just have a different way of dealing with it, but you know, you need to start preparing yourselves, its coming,\" he called out to her. She looked toward the voice, and she saw a young man, no older than twenty or twenty one. They had never seen him before. He looked very familiar though.\nShe took the child's hand in her right hand and the right hand of her older son, and held them close.

        "output": "Can you explain to me how the stable diffusion algorithm for ai generated images can be used to enhance the visual quality of low resolution and low quality images? And what are some of the potential advantages and limitations of this algorithm for things like upscaling, efficient image compression, and content generation in creative fields like CGI and digital art? The first one is an interesting one as I am thinking about it right now. I just watched a lecture or two by David Cohen. So it looks to me that if you do a fast Fourier transform on two images then you should get a correlation between them if they are similar. If there is similarity in frequency between the two images then there should be similar frequency components between the spectra of the images as well. That then means that if you try to enhance a certain frequency component of an image by changing the frequency component of the spectrum, e.g. change the color of the pixel to create a new pixel, then the frequency components of both images, spectra and maybe intensity as well, should be close to one another even if at first one is bright and the other is dark. That means that it should be possible to interpolate the frequencies of an image and then change the value of the pixels as well. I just have to think about it more, but I think it needs some fine tuning. I think its just by adjusting the frequencies so that if you multiply one frequency component by a certain value then the other frequency component should be about the same. That means then that the result of the multiplication should look very similar, maybe even identical as we have different frequency components overlapping. So this should then lead to enhancing frequency components in the image and then the image should be much closer to the real image and should also look better. The second one is interesting as well. I will not be able to answer this one easily as I am not a computer scientist or expert, but it seems like that if you are already working with 3d renderings, then you would have to have a big data set to train the ai to work well, e.g. you would have to have a huge data set of images of the same object from the different angles and so on. That means that you would need to have a lot of data to be able to train the ai and then a lot of data to train on with the ai. This seems very interesting to me too as I have started to read about neural networks and the recent developments that are happening in that area. That is a part of my work for now so I am currently reading the recent research papers to get a more deeper understanding about the topic. So if I understood correctly what you are saying. It seems like that if you are training the neural net on images of the same object from different angles, then you can use it to create more believable images or to blend different images to create more believable images where each image would be able to cover a specific part of the image and the different images could be blended together in different ways to create more realistic results. A couple of things about neural nets to keep in mind. They are very hard to tune for different kinds of images. For different content you should have different networks. There is not one universal network that can be trained on any image. For example, one might be good for face recognition, another might be good for color recognition, another might be good for video recognition and another might be good for pixel matching. So you need to tune your network for image content. Different content also has different requirements, but the latest development is that the neural nets work well for very large data sets. This gives you the large data set that you need to train on. So if you have a big enough data set you should be able to train a network in order to do image enhancement.\nThe best way to get in touch with me is by sending e-mails with any kind of questions that you have, comments and so, to [email protected].

        "output": "How can I use software defined radio to detect and locate a drone flying over my property? Using software defined radio to detect and locate a drone flying over your property is feasible, but it is still a work-in-progress. In theory, since most drones emit telemetry signals, it is possible to pinpoint the location of a drone using a software defined radio. However, it's a more challenging problem and there are some difficulties in doing so, mainly the fact that you need a very powerful antenna and a sophisticated detection software. If you have a Software Defined Radio, it is definitely possible to know how far is your home and how it is affecting your daily life. However, it will cost you a lot of money for installing the antennas, software, and tools that you will need. If you don't have a software defined radio yet, it is possible to detect a drone without any antennas and software. If you are using the RTL-SDR and the Golly Digital Software, it is possible to find the signals that a drone is using to transmit its location. In theory, if you receive a drone's telemetry packets, you can take their GPS data for positioning purposes. However, because this is a big problem to solve, I don't know any open source solution that will be able to find a drone's location easily. There are very sophisticated software defined radios that can decode all the telemetry and positioning data of a drone like the one used by Radio Paradise and others. They cost thousands of dollars and are not open source solutions. Maybe in the future you can find solutions that are easier to build for those who don't have hundreds of dollars to spend for software defined radios and antennas. I don't know if it would be possible to receive a drone's telemetry data and decode it using the RTL-SDR. If you manage to find the telemetry packet, the radio would have to be very powerful and you would need professional software to decode it. In theory, the RTL-SDR is powerful enough and most of the available open source software is powerful enough too. However, it seems to be very hard to do it. Even with the RTL-SDR, it is not possible to find drone's telemetry data packets, but it is possible to know if you have a drone on the air. If you are using the Golly Digital Software, it will be enough to know if there are any drones on the air by using the Signal Strength Meter and the Antenna Map features. If you have 2 or more drones flying at the same place, the Signal Strength Meter will show you the strength of the drones' packets. You will see which one is stronger, but you won't be able to tell if he is a drone or not. If you want that, you'll have to use the Antenna Map feature, which gives a nice presentation of all the drones flying around you. However, it will show only the drones that are close to your antenna and it will show them if they are drone or not. You must understand that your antenna will not be able to receive a drone's signals if they are 10 km far away. So, if you are using the Antenna Map feature and you see drones flying far away from you, it means they really are drones and not your neighbors' radio transmitters. I'm not sure about other open source solutions, but I'm not aware of any. Another thing that is important to understand about the drones is the fact that they only send a tiny telemetry data packet every few seconds. Sometimes, your RTL-SDR is not powerful enough to receive it. If you have a Golly Digital USB or a Software Defined Radio, it is very important to know this piece of information. Only try to receive the drones' packet if you already know that the RTL-SDR is powerful enough to do it. Sometimes in the RTL-SDR, it is not possible to receive the drone's packet, because the RF Signal in front of the antenna is too noisy or too powerful. If this happens, I recommend you to increase the Signal Gain using the RTX2872 and to change the Position to look for the drone signals in all positions. If after 10 minutes the radio is no longer powerful enough to receive the drone signal, it means that maybe the RF Signal in front of your RTL-SDR is too powerful. In this case, the best solution is to use an external antenna and perhaps a preamplifier."

        "output": "Hi open assistant, can you tell me what presidents day is? I had no idea where the phrase: “Hey, Google—tell me about President’s Day” came from. The answer was a Google Assistant ad for President’s Day. Wow. This might be the first time that a user initiated a search because of an actual piece of advertising content. But even more interesting than the idea of having an app that teaches the assistant, is the idea that this type of content will be a core part of the entire search ecosystem. Google has built its entire empire on this very theme. It’s the “Don’t be evil” that gives Google its power. Search is such a core part of our lives that it is a necessity. We cannot live without it. In the same way that, without air, we all die, without search, we all die. This is why Google has been so incredibly successful. It’s why its competition (and even Apple) tries to catch up. But unlike air, where a company can’t make more, the search market is very broad and it never ends. There is always another way to reach customers, there is always a new way to get them. For instance, you can advertise on Facebook in 1000 ways, or you can go to Google’s homepage in 1000 ways, to reach users. With search, however, we have entered a new era. With all of these new ways to reach users, we reach more users but simultaneously we also reach a user who might not have been reached before. The way people search and the topics they search for will get more specific. But the way companies advertise on search changes. The user will find new ways to search. The ads will be optimized for these new ways to search. The way people search will increasingly make search “advertising” more challenging. But this is why users love Google. This is why advertisers love Google. Google not only creates a value for the user but also for the advertiser. It is not only in Google’s interest to give the user a good search experience, but also to deliver advertisers to the user. This is why, even though the company has more than 100,000 employees, Google will not be taken over. Maybe Apple will buy Tesla’s self driving car division. Maybe Microsoft will buy Snap or Twitter will buy Linkedin or IBM will buy Box or Facebook will buy Instagram or Google will buy Apple (would you?). Whatever the case, Google will only be taken over by Google. Why? Because it is owned by its users. When a user comes to a search engine, Google is the “winner”. When he looks for an answer to his question Google is the “winner”. When the user types something in a search bar, Google is the “winner”. Why? Because Google gives the “winner” (user, again) a value. That value is not monetary. Monetary value is derived from the amount of money that the searcher pays in order to get that value, and Google is very clear about that. Google is never going to sell its users. Never! Google is very clear about that. But it knows that the next big thing it needs is ads. If the company can convince all of its users (again) that there is value, then it can monetize all of its users. Search can never be replaced. But it could be augmented. We believe in that augmentation. We believe in that company. That’s why we work with them.\nTags: Content, Google\nCategories TechnologyTags Content, Google\nDifferences between Dell and HP\nhttp://www.digitaltrends.com/?s=dell+vs+hp&submit=Submit\nCategories TechnologyTags dell, hp\nMicrosoft Patches Windows Zero-Day\nMicrosoft has issued a security bulletin (MS18-026) to address vulnerabilities in Windows.

        "output": "How many black holes are known to exists at the time of writing this? A black how is an object whose mass it so immense, such as the super-massive black holes that inhabit the Centers of our own Galaxies. These have masses some thousands to millions trillion of times the mass of our Sun what has a mass of some two million times that of the Earth.\n12. 12 Why Is The Earth Rotating? The Earth’s rotation is due to the effect of its gravity trying to be spherically symmetric, which is the same as saying that since the mass of the Earth is roughly uniform, it can’t be the same all around. And if one part of the Earth’s mass has a higher acceleration than a different part of the Earth’s mass, then that means that one part is being attracted more strongly than another part by the Earth’s central mass, which is the Sun at the center of our solar system. And such an effect is called a gravity. And this means that an object of mass, m, in gravity has an acceleration, g, which is given by Newton’s law F = mg. And that means: F = ma. And so if m is what we call inertia, which is always constant, then acceleration will always be what we call gravity, which is always a vector: a = F/m F/m = ma/m= g. a = g 1 g 2 a = (a-g)/g= g Since a=g, then a=0. So we have: a=0 and g=0. Now, all this can be easily found by the computer, so please don’t laugh, okay? So: f [a,g] = m*a What is the answer? The computer tells us that the minimum velocity at which the Earth is stable is [a,g] = g: f [0, 9.8, m2] = -m*0 + 9.8*0 = -9.8 m2 g = .98 g. g is approximately 9.81 m/s2 The Earth spins with an angular velocity, ω, of 7.292 km hr. And that means: 1 hr /day = (7.292 /60) km/hr = 4 km/(hr * km) = 5/160 km hr-1. So the Earth’s velocity is 0.26% of the speed of light. So at 300,000 km/hr, the velocity is 300km/hr.\n13. 13 The Earth Rains! 2) How does the velocity of a raindrop relate to its weight?

If the mechanism were due to friction, the mechanism that transformed the raindrops from a much larger to much smaller velocity as they strike the Earth’s surface, that would mean that there is an upward flux of the Earth’s gravity force against a downward pressure of the air’s force on that drops of water, and these are two opposing forces, and so there must be friction between the drops of water and the the molecules of the air. And if such were the case, then the drops would be losing mass by dropping particles off to the surface. And that means that the drops would be losing weight. And so it would appear that there is no mechanism whereby a raindrop acquires such a high velocity and still manage to be so light that it will fall to the ground without leaving anything behind. And that is certainly the case, and if that were true, then a raindrops of that had a weight of 0.012kg would have a mass of 120-0.12 = 118kg. And so if a 112kg had a falling speed of 250kmper hr, then its terminal speed in the center of the Earth would be 9.81 m/s2 x 250km/hr = 24225m/s, which is 24225km/hr, or 24km/sec.\n16. 16 Why Is Matter Heavier Than Antimatter? As an intermediate particle, a W+ particle is composed of an electron and a neutrino, and as an antimatter particle is composed of a positron, which is an electron with a positive charge, and of a positive anti-neutrino.\n17. 17 What Is The Higgs Field?

A good example is the description of a gene's effect on a trait, as a model of that effect has parameters that are to be estimated from data.\n\n\\strong{2.}  The map that describes a statistical description of a phenomenon, as in, the map is the model.  An important part of modeling is deciding \\em{what to model}, so this is in some sense a definition of a statistical model, but it is not the definition.  For example, a map of all roads in the US is a model of the \"US road system\", but it is not a statistical model, and it is not a very natural definition of a statistical model.  On the other hand a map of an area and the population density, together with a formula that describes where people live, is a model of the residential location of the population; this is both a natural and useful definition of a statistical model.\n\n\\strong{3.}  As noted in the comments, this is sometimes used in the wider sense to mean just a descriptive statistical concept.  This is sometimes a source of confusion, so this definition is not generally recommended.\n\n\\strong{4.}  Some people like this use of \"model,\" especially in their work, and do not regard \"model\" as a technical term in statistics, and this can lead to all kinds of confusion.\n\n\\strong{5.}  Above all, you need to decide on the usage, and be clear about it.\n\nComment: I hope everyone uses definition 3 when talking about models.  All other definitions are vague and have different meanings at different times.\n\nAnswer: Statistics is modeling. A model represents the relationships between variables. For example, a two-variable linear regression model can be used for making predictions about some outcome given its predictor(s).\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI have tried google.org site and it"

You will only want to use 1.5-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil….you do not want to use all of this as it will make your house smell like you fried the fish………I am very very sorry that this is not the recipe you are looking for…….but I guess this will work: Preheat your pan to medium high heat. Put a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil in the pan. Lay your salmon fillets in a single layer in the pan (salmon should be skin side down). Put about a tablespoon of butter or margarine in a small cup and rub a little of it on the fish. Put a little lemon juice (about a teaspoon to a tablespoon) in the cup and mix it with the butter and spread this on the skin side of the fillet. Cover the pan for about 2-3 minutes, turning one fillet and the other fillet with pan about every 1 minute. When your fish is done it should be cooked (white) on the side it is laying on top. When you flip the fillets make sure that you turn them so that they are not touching each other. You want them to have a bit of space between them. This will make sure that no extra pan juices get onto them. The other reason to make sure they are not touching each other is for presentation reasons. When you have the other side of the fillet you can also add a bit of butter and/or lemon on the flesh side and add a dash of fresh herbs (chives, rosemary, etc) or place a slice of lemon on top of the fillet….just place it so that it is facing outwards and does not touch the other fish. This will keep the fish moist and fresh. If you do not use the lemon and butter you will probably want to do something on the fillets to keep them moist and prevent them from drying out….this will also prevent your fillet from becoming too dry and flaky. Good luck. I hope this is what you were looking for…….but I was a little worried that I was giving you the wrong information….."

If so, what steps would I need to take to be qualified to fly it?\nPosted by: Fighter Jet, New Zealand | 11 August 2005 at 07:58 PM\nI find it amusing how the \"military experts\" on this site are all too willing to give their input on an aircraft that they apparently have never seen. There are at least a couple commenters here who have actually seen an F-7M, and they have commented that it is not an aircraft they would choose to fight with. Now, I have no idea what sort of plane I'd choose to fight with if I were a Chinese pilot, but I'm not about to assume an aircraft simply because it's from China.\nThat being said, I'd consider the F-7M a more serious threat than the Gripen, since the F-7M has the greater combat radius and 9g operational capability, among other things.\nHowever, all of the commentary in this thread has shown that the \"experts\" have really outdone themselves in their ignorance.\nPosted by: C | 02 December 2006 at 03:31 AM\nHi Col. Bing,\nI was just wondering if you can explain why it was so easy for the Chinese to produce an F-7M like version? Are these similar to Sukhoi's T-50 or their own? The F-7M was probably developed from the original F-7 because of the fact that it could not outstrip the SU-27 and its other sisters (F-9) developed at the time..\nPosted by: Tung | 22 June 2008 at 09:18 PM\nI don't know much about the F-7 variant. In this post, I described the F-7M variant\nPosted by: Bing | 22 June 2008 at 10:52 PM\nHi Col.,\nI was really impressed by the F-7M performance in a air fighter competition in the chinese air force some time ago (I think they competed against the Israeli air force's F-16's.) The F-7M was found to be inferior in the climb and acceleration categories, whereas it has a greater radius/payolig and better g-loading abilities as you said in the previous post.\nThe F-7M has a wing area of 2841 sq.ft. (8m²) while the F-16 has 3250 sq.ft. (9,0m²). This difference isn't much and i don't know if it has anything to do with the F-7M's ability to reach 9g better, though i'm guessing that the chinese had to do somethings to improve the F-7M's performance. The fact that the F-7M has a greater radius (1070km with the normal tank and 20000lb bombload) shows that the wings aren't that small that they can't hold up more fuel and bombs without compromising its acceleration in the vertical direction.\nThe wing loading for both the F-7M and F-16 are almost the same (a little worse for the F-7M). This does indicate that both perform to a similar extent. The F-7M's g-limit should be about 3g, according to this.\nhttp://sno.allstar.hu/aircraft/Su27_F2-2002.htm#specs\nI suspect that for the F-7M to be able to achieve better climb or acceleration numbers, it probably had a bigger afterburner and this was probably used very sparingly to gain the better than SU-27 and F-16's climb and acceleration.\nAs you also mentioned, the F-7M also has a radar that is superior to the F-16 and the SU-27. The radar is also apparently being integrated into the J-10 too which seems surprising (the F-16 has the same radar as the F-15?). The F-7M can also carry a 2400lb bomb externally, which is lesser on both the SU-27 and the F-16.\nOn paper the F-16 is supposed to have the best dogfighting capability as the others lag behind. This shouldn't make it the best fighter,"

A nanny would probably not be interested in these job specifics. A babysitter might be. But if you ask why people would do that, this is certainly not an aspect anyone would have in mind. However, the job is more suitable to the description in the babysitter profiles in this website.\n\nComment: I just noticed that your question is not complete. You want to work as a mother's helper but don't specify in what capacity, which makes this question ambiguous.\n\nAnswer: When I was looking for the perfect babysitter, I looked for someone that could fit all the descriptions mentioned in this question. Someone that was physically fit (can walk/run with our kids), could think on her feet (could answer questions on the fly), be self sufficient without a lot of micromanaging, be responsible, be able to take direction well, and act like the second parent.\n\nFor the most part, for my kids, who were 0.3 and four at the time, this was perfect. She was able to take on the physical challenges of their daily lives. She could answer most day to day questions and keep things moving along efficiently. She didn't require micromanaging because she took her job seriously and she was an efficient multi-tasker. She had prior experience and was professional enough to know how to handle her duties without being told what to do.\n\nI know from conversations with her that she was looking for a flexible schedule because she was in grad school at the time and had several different classes at different times each week. Having worked a night shift for 8 years, I found it to be very normal to not be able to commit to any one job full time any more because of schooling or other life changes. We had a shared understanding that one never has life totally under one's control.\n\nNow, since the time we hired our babysitter, she is an OBGYN.\n\nAnswer: I'm new to this place,  and don't know if I'm allowed to give an official answer -- I found lots of stuff about the proper way to word advertisements for helpers/babysitters/etc, but I didn't really find an \"about the person we're looking for\" question. Here's my best guess as a prospective babysitter!\n\nFrom a babysitter's standpoint, this sounds like a perfect job. You like kids, you feel competent taking care of them -- why not make a little money on the side? If I were going to do this, I'd make it clear that what motivates me here isn't the money: it's the flexibility.\n\nYou mention in your post that you work a full-time day job, which limits the amount of time you have available to be a sitter. You're also clear that flexibility in your babysitting work is a priority for you. I'm a college student, and I have a similar situation. I work a \"traditional\" job, and I do this babysitting job on the side -- in my limited experience, college students and other young people are generally more flexible with their hours. They're usually willing to work when it's a better time for my family (like at night, when most full-time workers are in bed and it's harder for them to work, but still perfectly reasonable for a teenager).\n\nSo if you can make this work at your job, make sure a key bullet right up front says that \"Flexible Hours a Priority!\" -- people who have an office job don't have very flexible weekends, but maybe someone who works an evening shift at the grocery store, or a lunch-counter, or a restaurant could be a great fit for your family. Maybe they'll be willing to show up at 10 PM and stay a few hours instead of a four-hour block, because they work nights and don't have a lot of other options -- but they"

        "output": "Are there any free SAST tools out there?\n[00:00] Scott, yes!\n[00:00] We have lots of blog posts on here on our blog. And we also have a great YouTube channel where we talk a lot about how to make things for free and also a whole bunch of free tools for SAST and SAST automation. Make sure you subscribe to our YouTube channel and you'll get all of the free resources up for grabs there once you do. And we also publish a newsletter every single week, you can get that at scottmcelroy.com/learn or by going over to iTunes and subscribing to the podcast.\n[00:35] A few of the tools that we have are open source and are available for free. And you can start with a lot of what we have here on our site including our SARS tool, and we have an automation process for SAST, and you can grab that for free on our site. And we also, if you're more interested in just getting started right away, a tool for that and that'd be great. We have a list, this is probably one of the best lists that you'll find for the available SAST tools that are out there right now. We have over 50 now so this is the newest update of our list. I think it keeps getting bigger and bigger.\n[01:19] And what's really cool about this is you can sort them by category of cost, so it's a free tool here on the website and a low pricing tool and then some tool are in this mid category. Higher and the, and you can also sort it by how mature the product is, so it's very new and less mature or older, it's stable or there's even tools that are just getting out to the market, they're trying to make a new SAST tool and it's brand new and you can see all that information on this tool on our site. In addition to that, we have, we also have a bunch of free tools that we'll actually pay for you. So you won't be using your own money to buy the tools and they run on your machine, so they're local, and we have great training for those. We have a few there that actually teach you how to do source code analysis and how to automate and how to make your own test. So that means that you are not dependent on us to create those test for you.\n[02:26] If you want to start using your own test and your own analysis and you're building your own framework for this on your own, you can go out and use our training and just make a framework for yourself, and that's all available for totally free on our site. So check that out. We'd love to have your support when you do. We also have a lot of other free tools out there for SAST and we have other video posts on our YouTube channel that go into, I think is it the six, six different free frameworks that we have out there. So make sure you go grab those as well. And there are just more to be found. But again, the key here is to make things, to build these tools for us, and that's what we do, that's what they get to benefit from.\n[03:18] All right. So we also have a framework for doing continuous delivery, it's something that a lot of teams try to get started with especially the, the smaller agile teams that are not quite sure how to get started with continuous delivery. So if you're interested in that, there are several tools in there and I know they're really well thought out and that the authors are available. I know that the teams are available to help you work out if some of these tools don't work right so for your team in particular. Great team out there, very active so give them a shout if you need that hand.\n[03:56] But the framework is available for free on our site, again, at scottmcelroy.com for the most part and you can also check with our YouTube channel for that one and there are also blog posts that'll help with specifics just get you going in the right direction if you are interested in that one as well.\n[04:17] All right. So again, there's a huge variety out there. This is the big thing, the challenge here that's hard is to just identify some of the best options out there. And so that is where we came up, we, I've been working on this for a month or so now, just trying to put things together. And I think we have a good"

        "output": "Why do we need AI assistants?\nSometimes we can be our worst enemy and no one takes pity on our own mistakes. So I have put together some of the more common mistakes to avoid when writing a news story.\nBefore you start writing you need to have a clearly defined plan, know what you are trying to achieve and have a well thought out strategy. You are trying to deliver information, it makes no sense to me if the reader has no clue where you are heading at the start. You should begin with clear and concise sentences that will give the reader a little insight into some of the main points you will cover.\nYour writing should be clear and concise, it should be straight to the point. I know from experience it can be hard, but you need to try and avoid using any filler words, which are the ones that do not add anything to the sentence. Avoid using “very” or “really” or other such words that will dilute the impact and will take away from the strength of your writing.\nWhen we read most of the time we are searching for something that will catch our interest and get us to keep on reading. If a story does not interest us straight away we are unlikely to read any further. So what do you do with that story? Well, you have a clear plan at your fingertips that will be concise and will catch the interest of the reader immediately and will keep them reading until the end. You have told the story in a manner that is easy to understand and will keep them reading.\nWhen writing try to keep everything at the most basic level, the easier it is for the reader to understand then the more likely they are to keep reading until the end of the story.\nYou have heard the old saying, “to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail.” If you are looking for a simple solution then you are likely looking at something that has multiple causes and will need a multiple solution. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking by writing one article it will fix everything.\nSo, there you have the top ten mistakes in writing news articles, remember to avoid these and your piece should receive the attention you are trying to achieve.\nThis is an article with the sole aim to make a change. I am not going to go into lots of detail about what causes this problem, and I’m not going to go into what you might have already known.\nI’m talking about a problem that people seem to be ignoring. It’s as if they don’t take any care about it at all.\nI am talking about the fact that most people are not getting the correct information.\nWhy are people ignoring this problem?\nWell, they are either not smart enough, or just are lazy.\nIt is common sense for some people. But some people can’t even use that.\nSo what information am I talking about?\nWell, we see it daily on our screens via our mobile devices.\nIt is the information that is being displayed to the world. In a quick second, it can be misconstrued and used in the wrong way. There is a lot of hatred present in social media, and this is what the people are using to spread their hatred.\nI’m talking from the perspective of a news writer, as well as a film critic.\nEverything I see online, via my mobile devices, is from the perspective of one person.\nEvery single thing that you see on social media is from one person’s perspective. And that is where the problems begin.\nPeople can’t handle the fact that other people have different views than them. They just have to get their own way. They can’t control themselves, and just have to react emotionally to how they feel.\nBut can you see where I am coming from?\nIt is all from one person’s perspective.\nWe have all, in this day and age, got our smartphone/mobile device and we are out and about. Whether it is on the train, in the street or in the office, you can be sure that our mobile is very important to our lives. In the news writing business, we are very careful when it comes to writing stories, knowing the difference between opinion and fact, how to write stories the right way and how to not make things seem very silly. We must be able to write with a very high level of intelligence, knowing the right words to use at the right time. In the film world, we have the same high level of intelligence and we have to be able to judge different movies and be able to tell the good ones from the bad ones. It can be extremely tricky and is sometimes a thankless task. We have different skills, different traits and we all know the tricks of the trade, but we are the exception when it comes to the general public and you see different ways to"

        "output": "Mike's mother had four kids. Three of them are named Luis, Drake, and Matilda. What is the name of the fourth kid?\nWe will be looking at how to write functions.\nThe function below returns a vector of 3 values, x, y, and z. Each value is between 1 and 4. What would be the easiest way of creating the vector that contains all 3 values.\nSuppose the price of gas was lower than $1.29 per gallon. What percentage greater than 30 would be $1.49 per gallon?\nIn the game of baseball, there are 9 positions on the field. What is the probability that the first 5 players selected are right-handed and have odd ages?\nThis can be achieved if we multiply both sides of the equation by its conjugate.\nSometimes it is easier to first rewrite an equation in some other form.\nIt also becomes useful in situations when we use a method that require more than one step, such as graphing a piecewise function.\nThe equations below all look the same. At first they do!\nThe difference is, when we square both sides of the equation, we have a factor of 2 on both sides of the equation. This is not so true for the first example.\nThis happens because in the first example, we divided by , instead of squaring, we could have been dividing by 4, which is less than 1 when you square them both.\nOn the other hand, notice how the sum of two number is always either the same number as the larger number, or it is the smaller number.\nWe would call this linear because the function has a straight or horizontal line in it.\nNow we can look at an example in the general format.\nThis is a linear function because we have one constant and one dependent. The constant is 5.\nThe function above has one independent variable, x and 2 dependent variables, y and z.\nThis type of function is called quadratic.\nIt can also happen if there are two variables. For example, if our independent variable is x and our dependent variables are y and z.\nIn general, we have 2 independent variables and at most 2 dependent variables. That means it should be quadratic equation.\nWe can create a quadratic equation by starting with an equation like the one below.\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 24 to get 2x – 3x = 12 when we divide both sides by 3.\nWe can now rearrange the equation like this.\nNotice how this equation has a form to it. It is the same form that we have seen with linear equations.\nYou can verify that this is quadratic by looking at the constant in the second term compared to the constant in the first term.\n1 + 3 is 4. This is less than the constant in the second term. This means that we have a quadratic equation. And the quadratic equation above is in the general form that we discussed earlier.\nNow that we know what a quadratic equation looks like, we can look at how we can find its solution. This is a quadratic equation, so we should have a method to solve this.\nWhat about other equations like the one above. Is there a way to find its solution by looking at it?\nThis equation is also linear, since we have one constant (7) and one variable (x).\nThe equation (like the one above) that has 1 independent variable and 2 dependent variables is called a quadratic-linear equation or in short, a quadratic.\nSuch quadratic-linear equations has a solution when the coefficient of one of the dependent variables is greater than 0. Otherwise, the solution is x = 1.\nFor both the quadratic-linear equations above, we have the constant is greater than 0, so we have solution.\nIn order to solve such equations, we should first find the solutions to the linear equations.\nIf we solve (3x + 5) + [−5x − 7] = 14, we get x = 1. And if we do the reverse we also get x = 1, so we have 4 solutions for this quadratic-linear equation.\nIf we solve 3w + x + 2j = 4w + 4t + 2m = 4s + 3m + 1t 2s + 3t = 2j + 1t – 3m where j,m,s,t,w,x are all constants, we get the solution as t = w + x – 2j – m.\nSo far we have seen how to solve equations in two steps. But what if the second step involved an even more complex equation? Well..there is another way to solve for our"

Even if you are an accomplished and intelligent businessperson, you should never go into a trade blindly. This is…\nApril, a few weeks ago we were asked to answer some questions that would guide us through our time in London.

They asked questions on how we would rate our experience and whether we would encourage others to study abroad. But in my mind the question that has always stuck out was, ‘What was the most challenging aspect of studying abroad in London?’ In my answer I wrote about the difficulty of not being able to fully relate to anything, in an attempt to describe how different my first few days back in the US were. The biggest challenge, though, is something I’d never been prepared for. It was the first day back in Texas. I remember as I got on the airplane that day, it was a little harder to find my seat because I was carrying what, at the time, felt like a thousand pounds. My heart was full to bursting with memories, but the heaviness wasn’t from nostalgia. It was something else entirely.\nNow, I have a confession to make. For the last month or so I’ve been pretending to be someone I’m not and I have not been enjoying it. I’ve been trying to hold conversations I do not wish to have, eating the foods I do not like, and talking about music I do not appreciate. I’ve been trying to make small talk and have become an expert at sarcasm in the process. Why am I doing this? I’m doing it without my heart. Since I left for London, I had lost something. It took a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly it was, but I slowly found out that I had lost part of my soul.\nBeing in London has taught me a lot of lessons but its most important lesson of all has been this: you cannot ever fully understand another person unless you understand them from their perspective. Whether it’s culture, family, religion, or language; every little detail that you don’t see with your own eyes should always be taken into consideration. Not everyone else sees the world the way you do, and even though there is a chance that you are never going to be able to truly understand, that doesn’t mean that you should ever stop trying. For the first time, I had taken the time to live another’s life and I understood from a different perspective, but something was still missing. As I boarded that plane, I left with my heart in London. After months of pretending to be someone else, I finally had the opportunity to become me again.\nI walked off the airport, back into my own life and in that very moment I had finally realized what I was missing. I walked back into the arms of family, friends, and the community I love so much but I wasn’t just walking back into my life, I was walking back into my heart. For months I had been wandering through airport terminals and cobblestone streets with my soul lost at sea in a sinking ship of culture shock. Through it all I lost myself in the process. I became somebody else, but that was never meant to be. I am me, and when I put that person back inside of me, that is when I finally felt like I was home. It was my family and friends that brought me back to my heart and I finally felt like all the miles I had traveled meant something. I was not going to live this lifetime pretending to be someone I’m not. I am me, and that is who they love, care for, and want back. At that exact moment, I finally had found my heart again.\nThe time spent abroad is one that I will never forget, because it’s an experience like"

Don't even think about answering the question before you know what it is.\nThe first step to interview success is making sure you've got the right questions in your back pocket. It may sound counterintuitive, but answering a bunch of questions you aren't prepared to answer is the worst possible use for a job interview.\nIf you are a job hunter - or you know someone who is - the following is crucial advice.\nAsk to talk to a few of their employees or volunteers. Job interviews will be a walk in the park if you come to them well prepared. Make sure to learn about the company through the Internet or a business library. This tells your interviewer that you are interested in the company and you did your homework. Make sure your resume highlights the job description requirements. In some cases you'll be in one of two situations - a job description or an advertisement for a job opening.\nFor example, a job advertisement for \"catering\" might have a specific need for someone with catering experience. Take some time to go over the job description or advertisement and see if there are any key words that you need to make sure you address. This can be a make or break situation in a job interview. Be prepared to highlight a weakness; no one's perfect!\nThink of something small that you can take the high road on.\nAsking about a \"weakness\" in a job interview isn't like asking about your greatest fear or a terrible experience.\nInstead ask about something that was hard for you but that you overcame. Or perhaps ask what your \"next step\" might be at the company. It may open a path to something more.\nHire the Wrong Candidate\nWhen this happens, a great hire becomes an awkward situation. So, I'm going to walk you through some great job interview questions you should ask in order to avoid making this all-too-common mistake. I use the phrase \"job interview questions\" very loosely.\nThere are only 3 types of questions you need to know how to ask in a job interview and you will ask them at each stage of the interviewing process. When someone asks you what you are looking for or what types of roles are a good match, tell them you are interviewing to learn more about the company and what types of roles they are hiring for.\nThese are two different things. When you say that, it becomes obvious to them that you are interviewing for the position and not just chatting, it also puts you in a great place to ask questions.\nYou might be surprised at how many candidates are going to skip this, even the more experienced ones. It's often the case that they can get away with not asking this question and it doesn't occur to them.\nYou might also like: CHILD OF BLOOD ANGEL EPUB\nFor this reason, I tell candidates to ask this at the very beginning of the interview since it provides them an opportunity to understand whether or not this is an opportunity that makes sense.\nDon't wait until the very end of the interview to ask this when you already spent 30 minutes talking to your interviewer. Asking this question can help you find out more about the company and the position and it's also important from a practical standpoint.\nBecause the \"salary history\" question is illegal, you need to have a response at your fingertips that doesn't include this and so you should ask this at the very beginning too.\nAlso read: EMPOWERMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PHASES IN TANK BIBBY PDF\nIf the company does ask about this"

        "output": "Can you help me understand how I can estimate the variance of a variable? I want to estimate the variance of my Y variable so I can compute its variance. As you know, variance is the average of squared differences between the observations and their mean. Variance is measured by the squared deviation around the mean as you indicated. To express this in algebra, we need to multiply each difference by the deviation, then square each, and add them all together. So you get: Variance = mean squared deviation The mean is given by: mean = sum (x-average)/n and you can calculate your n, using the formula: n = N - 1 where N = number of data points There is one more formulation that is related to the variance, but it is more difficult as we do not have access to the individual deviations. It gives the so-called standard deviation, which a rather complicated formulation, but you can find details in books on statistics. The basic idea of a standard deviation is that we first calculate the deviations or the individual differences from the mean. We take the average of these values as the variance and then divide that by the number of data points. Standard deviation = (average of differences)/n. The variance is a measure that tells you how much the average and the individual differences differ. The standard deviation is a somewhat \"weighted\" average. It tells you how far on average the individual differences are from the mean.\nOn 2/28/17, I emailed you asking how to get a frequency distribution.

As the last day of the Dread Month, this new day means that the sun shines on the people of Tamriel for the final time this year. It’s a strange thought for some, especially those of us from Cyrodiil. The Dreadlands get the same amount of rainfall and sun every day of the year. When you live for a thousand years, the seasons and years begin to blend together if you don’t pay attention.\nI never liked the Dreadlands. The only people who ever enjoyed the Dreadlands were mercenaries who had no family. And maybe that’s the problem. The only people who liked the Dreadlands are people who don’t have real families. I grew up in Solitude. My family is still there. That’s why I left. That’s the only reason I left, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t break my heart when I think of my mother and father, when I think of them looking at me with concern and guilt in their eyes.\nI haven’t seen them in over a year. Soon, I’ll be able to leave the Dreadlands.\nWhenever I look at the sun, the same thought occurs to me over and over again. Maybe I’ve grown too accustomed to the dark, or maybe the thoughts just come when the sunlight hits me.\nThe first time I left was a mistake. I was 17 in the year 1248. I was in College of Winterhold to become a Mage. My tutor was a Master Naybynight, a scholar of sorts who taught me the arts of the magi. He taught me the basics of magic, but before the month was out he sent me to Dwemer in search of crystals. I managed to find two, but I stumbled across the ruined remains of a once-mighty city. In the city, I found a strange crystal. It was shaped like a cross. It told tales of a great war where all but one race had perished. I knew this crystal had given those dark things their power, and I knew I had to destroy it.\nThe crystal was strong, and the fight that ensued was bitter and long, at first. Eventually, I killed the crystal. Upon its defeat, the Dwemer technology there came to life. I fled, and when I returned to the College, they were gone. The master died when I returned however, so I went back to Dearthcleft, where I was staying at the time, and headed to the College. I thought the master had died, I had no idea he had been pulled into one of Tamriel’s many planes. I waited, desperate to learn what I could from this Master.\nAfter a month, the master was found. So I waited. Another month. During these months I came to learn more about Magicka, and discovered what Master Naybynight taught me was a distortion of the truth. It was then that I began to question what I knew. The same thing happened to Master Naybynight.\nWhen he returned, I asked him about the ruined city. He didn’t know what I was referring to. As he told me of his tale, he became angry. He asked where the rumors of his death had come from. They came from… no one. Everyone believed that he vanished with Magicka. A few people said they saw him in Solitude, but no one saw him leaving the Dreadlands with a young mage, even after I had been waiting at the College to hear what he had to say.\nI was saddened, angry even, but I learned from him, and I’ve been learning ever sense. I didn’t believe the stories of these great wars and great kingdoms, so I began to delve into books that described the history of the world. I learned that it was true. Great battles were fought"

        "instruction": "How do polar bears stay warm in Arctic winters?",
        "output": "How do polar bears stay warm in Arctic winters? By blending in with sea ice, rather than white snow, scientists have discovered. And there, as the researchers expected, the bears hid and waited until the cold and darkness of the day had passed. This technique, called the active shelter hypothesis, also explains how polar bears are able to stay warm even when there is little wind and when most sea ice is covered with snow or ice drift. Snow, wind and ice drift can reduce the amount of solar radiation that reaches the ice and bears, thus reducing the energy loss through the ice and bears fur. The bears, therefore, blend into the white background, which allows them to keep warm. The researchers, from Pace University in NY, USA, analysed the behaviour of polar bears over three Arctic seasons between 2006 and 2008, focussing on those in the region of Hudson Bay, Canada. They used remote sensing cameras to watch polar bears. They also measured the physical properties of snow and ice in the area. Their study is published in the Journal of Experimental Biology. ---------------------- Polar Bears - Eating Habits Polar bears have four digits on each front paw and five on the back pair. The polar bear’s large paws help it swim, hunt ice seals and drag prey across snow. ------------------------- Polar Bears - Mating, Fertilization & Reproduction Mating season occurs once per year, usually May through July. The female will go into her winter den around mid-October. Birth occurs about 25 weeks later. ------------------------------------------------------- Polar Bears - Habitat Lives on sea ice or land. The sea ice is essential for most of its activity, including hunting and migration. The species spends nearly all year above the Arctic Circle. --------------------------- Polar Bears - Hunting Diet mostly consists of ringed seal, but also will kill young and adult polar bears, bears with injured paws, Arctic fox and lemming. Can also eat birds, eggs and carrion. Bears will kill females with cubs and very young bears. -------------------------- Polar Bears - Dangers Threats from global warming, loss of habitat, over hunting, illegal poaching and attacks by humans which lead to loss of habitat and loss of life. Disease and parasitism can also be deadly. ---------------------------------------- Polar Bears - Death Deaths can be caused by disease, starvation, injury from car crashes or hunting accidents. Polar bears usually live less than 20 years in the wild. ----------------------------------------------------- Polar Bears - History Originally thought to be about 24 million years old. The polar bear’s ancestors were weasel-like carnivores. In 2014, scientists announced that the polar bear’s closest relative was the yellow-pawed mammoth, which lived at least 40,000 years ago. ------------------------------------------ Polar Bears - Conservation Polar bears have been identified as an endangered species. Polar bears cannot be relocated. Therefore, conservation strategies rely on protecting the polar bear’s habitat. In 2005, 15 nations joined together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050. Since then 19 nations have joined and committed to reducing their emissions by 2020. ---------------------------------------------------------- Polar Bears - Reproduction Very few polar bears reproduce in captivity. The zoo does have a successful program. ------------------------------------------------------ Polar Bears - Characteristics Characteristics: White fur, black nose, sharp teeth and claws, long neck, webbed feet, thick blubber. Height: 5 feet (140 cm) Length: 9 feet (275 cm) Weight: Male 630 lb (290 kg) Female 525 lb (235 kg) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nViews: 1094120 Science and Tech News\nAnimal Spirits in Action: The Fate of the Polar Bear\nWatch more Environmental Science and Ecosystems videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/506668-animal-spirits-in-action-the-fate-of-the-polar-bear Here on Earth, we are seeing some of the world's most spectacular and important environmental change right now.

After a 12 month interval, a woman retests for cervical cancer (and gets a smear test). It's possible they have no Pap Smear recorded in their medical record and would like to know how often they should receive a smear test and is it normal to receive just one in a 12 month and 24 month interval or should they receive more smear tests? Thank you.\nMy question is how early can cervical cells show signs of dysplasia? My wife had a pap test done a few months back and it read borderline dysplasia, then they re-did it right away and it was \"normal\". They told her to follow up with her GYN in a year. But the thing is I think I found dysplasia in a vaginal smear I sent her. The smears are always in the clear fluid (or whatever it is) that comes out of the cervix. The smear is always less than what is left in the vial. How do you tell if cervical cells are dysplastic? Is the cell structure different in a dysplastic cell. My smears go back several years and only in the last few month have I started observing the cells closely (in those smears you could see the different cell types with great detail). I see dark green glandular cells, red neucleated cells, and large cytoplasm cells (like lymphocytes). I have only seen a dysplastic cell in one of those smears. So I guess my question is if a dysplastic cell is observed in the smear is it abnormal (in terms of structure) and different from a normal cell? Or are there just too many cells mixed into one smear? Thank you for your help\nI would like to point out that the risk of cervical abnormalities in smear tests is not 1 in 20 for women under 30 but 10 in 20. This seems to be the commonest misunderstanding regarding the risk of women having positive smear test results. Also an abnormal cell does not necessarily mean cancer. The only way of knowing for sure is to carry out an endoscopic, (sometimes called colposcopic) or LLETZ procedure and remove the tissue for biopsy. The procedure only takes a few minutes. A test for HPV can be carried out along with a colposcopy, and can give a clearer indication of the risk of developing cancer, but sometimes a clear indication is not possible and further tests are necessary. A smear test is not 100% reliable and is very much an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of abnormal cells but can not be depended on to detect abnormal cells. It is only when smears start to come back abnormal that you should have a colposcopy. As I said an abnormal cell does not necessarily mean cancer and further tests are necessary. I do believe that it is a good idea to start at least 10 years before the age at which you will have stopped having a normal period as your risk increases over the years. There is little doubt that a smear test every 2 years for the life of a woman until the age of 64 is a good idea.\nCervical smear results\nI would like to thank you for providing me with an understanding for the different results of smear tests. My question is this - If an HPV test is carried out and found positive but other parameters such as acid squames and NLUC (not clear utra nuclear condensation) are low grade, can the smear test be said to be \"normal\"? Also, can you please inform me of what the different \"normal\" smear test results mean? Thank you in advance.\nI have a question, I understand that having H"

They're supposed to be able to track illegal weapons so that if they're used to murder, they can trace the weapon to figure out where it was sold.\nI would trust the FDA rather then the ATF...\nYeah, in that case I think that there needs to be some more attention in the media and I personally would also like to see more attention to this issue as I think that the rights of citizens should come before the needs of politicians.\nIn the case of Eric, I think that his decision to quit his job was the correct one to me. There is a whole list of other things that people who work at their jobs do that would be unacceptable in one's life, such as going to the bathroom too often, failing to do their work or perform actions that were mandatory before going on their lunch, or for that matter taking too many lunches or breaks.\nSuch actions would quickly result in a dismissal if a person did any of that but when someone puts their personal life before the lives of others it seems that there's still some level of tolerance.\nSitting on your hands (while in a school), not performing the required mandatory actions, not doing the best job that you can do can all be forgiven but when you put yourself in a situation that can make you dangerous and possibly hurt or injure others then I think that the person has to be dealt with more severely than they otherwise usually would be.\nThis is why I am not so much against the idea of having someone like an ER nurse work a few hours at a time without getting a break. The nurse would need to work on a break for as long as they took their own, and then if any nurse was going to take such a break they would have to do it without endangering the health of the other patients (such as by putting someone's IV into the neck of a person or something).\nI think that there would be some other problems with that such as for example for those people who would have to work around the clock and have to work more than one shift at a time (something that nurses are often required to do and often have to deal with when there is a shortage of nurses or other health care workers).\nAnyway, this is why I think that in the case of Eric and others like him (and myself as well) who have made the decision, it was the right decision.\nIf this is something that is going to be used against those people who are trying to deal with the problem, then it's only going to result in more of them resigning or refusing to work in the emergency room and then others will be required to be on 24 hours shifts or they will have to be hired on a part time basis.\nThis is why I am not so much against the idea of having someone like an ER nurse work a few hours at a time without getting a break.\nBut that is exactly what Dr. Wallace stated was the problem.... he stated in a letter that it was the length of time over which a break was being taken, and the number of hours between breaks... that caused the problem.... thus not in the form of \"a few hours\" but from the perspective that this nurse was taking several breaks a day.\nHe didn't state any other problems with the nurse, such as what you and others are focusing on.\nI personally don't think that such a nurse would be in any better of a position of working 6 hours at a time with a small break and then 6 hours without a break than one that worked 12 hour shifts, but that's just my personal opinion.\nI would like to see if this man even has a medical license to practice in the state of Ohio. Too many docs and nurses have been slaughtered by the ATF in the last ten years. ATF needs to be dissolved!!!! But no doubt"

        "instruction": "Can you list the issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modelling problems?",
        "output": "Can you list the issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modelling problems? No. Symmetric probability distribution is usually used when modelling problems in which there are different factors affecting the probability of each result. No factor causes negative probability, and all factors lead to positive probability.\nWhen modelling dependent probabilities, you need to take negative or other factor into account: there exists a point on the probability curve (called the mode) and in which the probability is maximum. No. Probability calculation in symmetric distribution is straightforward: P (x) = n(x )n(x ) +n(x ) We do not need to determine the mode in the probability curve. This is done automatically by software such as EXCEL. Yes. This model is also used to describe the relationship between two factors such as: the probability that a company will default on a loan is 0.5 (if the two loans do not default on loans at the same time) If a company defaults on a loan, the default of that same company will be 0.4 Therefore, if there are other reasons to default (say the economy is falling, resulting in other companies defaulting, then companies that have not defaulted before become more likely to default). To find the default probability in a symmetric distribution: Calculate the weight of the number of nondefaulters: P (nondefaulter) = n (nondefaulter) n (nondefaulter) +n (defaulter) = a n (nondefaulter) a n (defaulter) +b n (defaulter)\nCalculate the weight of the number of defaulters: P (defaulter) = n (defaulter) n (defaulter) +n (nondefaulter) = 2b n (defaulter)\nCalculate the weights of 1. the number of nondefaulters of nondefaulters: P (nondefaulter) n (nondefaulter) n () n () n () P (defaulter) n (defaulter) n () n () n () n (defaulter) n (nondefaulter) n () a p p a p n n n\nCalculate the weight of 2. the number of defaulters of defaults: P = n n (defaulter) (defaulter) 4 a b n n b = a n n b n () n (nondefaulter) () a n n a n n (defaulter) ()\nCalculate the probability of default: P (default) = n (defaulter) n n (defaulter) =\nSoftware can then find the maximum probability which is the default mode automatically.\nNo. This is the general method applicable to all functions such as: a. Normal, b. Raised Pareto, etc.\nSoftware generally uses a single standard method (e.g. EXCEL uses MonteCarlo).\nWhen using multiple standard methods (e.g. EXCEL also uses Linear Approximation Method), the output is very different and inexperienced users might not recognise the difference.\nYes, as it is relatively straightforward.\nNo, it gives wrong estimates. Linear Approximation Method is applicable to most functions including: a. Normal, b.

        "output": "What are some of the well known hiking trails in Colorado? Can you provide a short description of each? This is one of the most commonly asked questions among guests staying with us at the Glenwood Springs Inn.\nThe best known hiking trails in Colorado are the ones that start right in downtown Denver. The three major trails within Denver are the South Platte River Park, Cherry Creek Greenway, and Cherry Creek Trail. Of those three, the Cherry Creek Trail is considered to be the most popular and the most difficult to access. This is because the Trail is built on top of some railroad lines which require one to have the proper equipment for safety if you decide to take your mountain bike or a horse along on one of these trails. This makes the Cherry Creek Trail one of the most desirable areas for tourists to bring their mountain bikes or horses along because of the fact that all other areas around Denver require too much gear to safely use.\nTo access these areas from Glenwood Springs, one only needs to turn left at the Y on I-70 and find their way to the Denver area. I-70 runs North/South through the state. You'll enter the town of Idaho Springs which has many great little tourist type businesses for your stopping at on this trip. From Idaho Springs, turn right on I-25 to get to the Denver area. Upon entering Denver, you will find the following areas marked for these designated trails:\nDenver/Boulder Turnpike\nThe Denver/Boulder Turnpike is a very nice road which ends in the city of Denver. I have many friends who have taken their mountain bikes up the Turnpike and have had a great riding experience on this route. One thing to watch out for is that the Turnpike is shared by bicyclists, automobiles and, sometimes, wildlife. Wildlife may seem like a minor problem but one good whack from an elk's hoof and you may have permanent damage to your car.\nThe Colorado Trail is very important to tourists of Colorado. I know that as a tourist in Colorado, the Colorado Trail is one of the major reasons I stay in Colorado. My favorite part of the Colorado Trail is the area from the Denver/Boulder Turnpike to the Denver area which I have seen on many of my journeys through that area. To access these areas, turn left on the C-470 Exit and follow it until you reach the Colorado Trail (see the picture of the Colorado Trail signs that I've shown). There are signs for these trails in the Denver area but this area can become confusing because you have to find the right trail that is going in the right direction.\nI have found the trails to be very well marked. The trails are also well maintained. I've noticed that every time I'm in Denver, I see construction areas where work has been completed to the trails.\nThe best time of year for hiking the trails is obviously in fall. It's too far up in Denver to go hiking in winter. This is due to the excessive snow fall in Denver. Also, if you do go for a hike in the winter time, the weather up in Denver can be brutal at times. It's just too far from Glenwood Springs. It's hard enough to go hiking in Denver even if you live in Glenwood Springs.\nAnother good time of the year to hike the trails in Denver is in spring. You'll see the flowers come out while you are hiking. I would suggest staying one night in the Denver area if you are really enjoying the hiking and the area. Denver has some of the most beautiful mountain views. So enjoy the hiking but please take extra caution while doing so because the weather up there can get rather nasty. Also there are dangerous animals up there. Bears, snakes, and the occasional rattler, which lives in Denver and is not poisonous but its just a better thing to be safe than sorry. To access the Denver/Boulder Turnpike from Garfield County, turn on Hwy 6 and follow it through the mountains, into Idaho Springs. Continue straight on Hwy 6 for about 5 miles north of Garfield County. Then turn right on I-25 which will take you directly into the Denver area.\nThis is one of the most well used tourist destinations in Colorado. This particular trip is an excursion. So you won't find a mountain view on"

I only use it as a spread not always in sandwiches so can’t always be sure if it is the correct consistency. It is usually quite stable and firm.\nHi Maddie, you can use this recipe for your cakes, it is great for decorating and will be very stable…. if you want to add water to make it a bit less thick do so after adding the egg yolk.\nYou’re the expert! This mayo could very good if you know how to blend your ingredients. I can make my own mayo from scratch. The same with the recipe you gave above. It just takes a lot of skill.\nA big no no from me. Never ever use double cream. It just ruins it. Apart from you won’t use the whole lot you have mixed together. I was taught at home never to waste food and to be careful of wasting eggs. There are lots of variations you can use that do not require the double cream. You can never go wrong with olive oil as a base. It always has an excellent taste.\nNever use the double cream as you have, it will not set and will not keep in the fridge.\nCream can also be replaced with half and half and will set better in the fridge, but still doesn’t taste too great and isn’t great for you.\nThank you, that’s the main problem. You can make it so creamy at home using a hand mixer or balloon whisk, but still not like double cream. It will also last a day, even two in the fridge.\nWhat’s the reason 1 tbsp doesn’t really thin it out much any ideas?\nIt works very well for the cakes in this post!\nAs for using less butter, you’d have much less stability or it may even separate when exposed to heat, like on your grill!\nI know a great mayonnaise recipe. If I remember rightly, I stole this from a TV cookery show when I was only 6 or 7 years old! I think it’s called Mary Berry’s Mayonnaise Recipe. It’s 100% guaranteed to work, and I guarantee that your guests will be impressed! To start: put 8 tbsps sunflower oil in an ovenproof container (eg a shallow pyrex dish). Break 1 egg into a separate bowl, add 3/4 tsp of lemon juice, and mix with a balloon whisk (do NOT use a stiff wisk!!) Add the mixed egg and oil/lemon mixture to the container, and swirl everything together. Heat oven to 120 degrees (or at least enough for small pieces of grilled foil to melt and sizzle without scorching themselves). Now, wrap a piece of clingfoil around the container and wrap it securely with sticking foil. Add some chilli to this mixture, and this will cause the whole of the mixture to puff up slightly. Put it in the super-hot oven for 2 hours! After the 1st minute of the 3rd hour (at around 1440 degrees for me!) take the heat out and let it cool inside the foil. After 2 mins of cooling, take it out of the foil and carefully cut a bit off the end (a bit like opening a can of baked beans with the end removed!!) and then leave it in an airtight container until your next ‘mayo’ order.\nIt uses less oil and it tastes good too!!!!!\n"

We were always told their hens were bigger, but we really didn’t know how we could tell the difference. So after a little while, we put all of our eggs in one basket and then compared their eggs alongside ours. And you know… no comparison!\nThanks for posting this story, it makes you think about what makes an egg an egg.. And to think of what the different “ingredients” of eggs mean to the health of the eggs and how they’ve been taken care of. It’s very much like comparing apples to oranges, even the same type of apple in two different stores isn’t necessarily going to give the same results. So, you have to eat a lot more fruit to determine which ones taste “better” or which way they look, is a better apple. But it all really comes down to how you’ve taken care of your produce, and where it was sourced and how that impacts the taste."

It is a more important sentiment in some cultures than others, and some are more obvious than others, but if that's what you are looking for here's something to get you started:\n1. Ahwa\nThis Korean name means good parenting.\n2. Ana, meaning I love you in Portuguese. It can also be spelled Ana, Ana, Ana, or Ana.\n3. Ananya, meaning unparalleled in Sanskrit.\n4. Ann, meaning grace in Latin.\n5. Anniqa, a Scandinavian-Muslim name meaning \"gift of God\".\n6. Anokhi, meaning original in Punjabi.\n7. Anoush, meaning flower in Persian.\n8. Anouk, a Dutch variation of both Aneek and Anne. It means \"grace\" in French.\n9. Anushka, meaning grace in Hindi/Punjabi.\n10. Anya\n11. Auburn, meaning the place between a stream and a hill in British. And of course it also comes from the hair colour.\n12. Bubbu\n13. Cynthia a name meaning \"winner\".\n14. Desiree, a name originating from the French words \"Desir Aimé,\" meaning \"desired love.\"\n15. Donna, meaning woman from Italian.\n16. Gizra, meaning a child or person of high esteem in Hebrew.\n17. Ghia, a common Italian last name. Meaning a child of high esteem in Hebrew.\n18. Gisella, meaning God's oath or God's promise in Italian.\n19. Guan Yu, a Chinese name meaning \"virtually indestructible.\"\n20. Iris, meaning the rainbow in Greek.\n21. Izabella, meaning God is my oath in Polish.\n22. Kameela, is a Arabic name meaning \"beautifull woman\".\n23. Keana, meaning love in Hawaii. It is also the name for the island of Hawaii. So in the Hawaii language, Keana means \"Love for Hawaii\". However in Polynesian its translation is \"Love of heaven\".\n24. Kenna, meaning kindness in Gaelic.\n25. Karina, meaning golden in Slavic.\nThere are a lot of names but of course it's hard to decide which one suits your taste. Here's my advise:\n1. if your name is a short and simple name, perhaps try to have a short simple name for your baby. (example: Anabelle, or a mix of old and new (Reyes, Bella)..) If your name is a long and complex one for your baby, maybe to your liking is also long and complex name. My recommendation, you can use your name and the name of your partner - if your names match, then it's an exception - if not ... maybe you should choose other names.\n2. If you think your daughter must have a name that has a meaning of love, but you like the sound of this name. You should not choose a name which means love, because there's another, different name that has the same meaning that you liked better.\n3. If your mother was unlucky in his life - such as divorced, died young, left, etc. - then maybe you can give your baby the name of your mother, but if so, your mother should be given a name that is not a child, but to be remembered as a good mother. (For example, you can name your daughter Mary.)\n4. Choosing a name for your baby, it is preferable not to use names or other names of grandparents or relatives from the father. If your baby is girl, you do need to use female names and you do not need to give girls the names of brothers or fathers, as a boy (for example, you should certainly not give the name of a father or grandfather is very common as \"Chris\" or \"Scott\").\n5. Even choose names for your child to have a relationship - you should not give your daughter a name that is already a boy's name"

Math isn’t my subject. I can do simple multiplication and division but that’s it. Adding, subtracting doesn’t work for me. If I could just learn how to calculate travel times I could rule the world.\nToday’s challenge for the IWSG is a mathematical one.\nWhat’s been the hardest math problem you had to work? Is it still hard to figure out how to calculate travel times or do you handle it with ease?\nHahahaha, I just nodded my head and did my silent thing while I read the comments. I'm the queen of numbers so it would only bother me that they gave me a different way to do things.\nI haven't used any math in a long time, it's always a nightmare for me, I just wish I could turn it off sometimes lol!\nTravelling for me, at long distances is always fun when I don't do math. Like I don't keep track of the time. And what was easier is, I never kept note of the time. So when I get confused, I just look at the watch or the time and then just look at the time again. And I find it to be good way as well because when you're enjoying the journey, you'll never care if it is 3 hours or 40 hours.\nOh yes, I love watching them figure out the best way or the exact way to get somewhere. It's so frustrating to be on vacation when you have to go somewhere for some reason or other. I don't have much math talent either. That's why I don't do this IWSG post. LOL.\nWe didn't understand the time/distance thing when I was growing up, but now I'm a little confused on distance & weight.\nI'm not very good at this kind of math. I like the problem that you were given, though - it had me thinkin' for a long time, but I finally came up with an answer.\nOh, yes, I'm one of those people who doesn't understand math equations. I'm pretty good at basic math skills, but when it comes to equations, I've never been able to figure it out. I've never been able to understand it no matter how hard I tried.\nI hate math in general. I can understand it, and can do the basics like add, subtract, multiply, divide. But I have the same issues as you. I don't get what that equation means. It never makes sense to me.\nHaha, I’m really not good at math either. I only grasp it when I’m in the exam hall. Not in the textbooks. And I totally don’t know how to calculate travel times. Forget about the answer. But, it all depends on how good your GPS system is. I’d get lost without my GPS.\nI can follow the equations and work it out if I try, but it's a nightmare.\nI took a couple of math classes, but it wasn't until I was in my late thirties that I really understood it, so I'm not a math whiz, that's for sure, but travel time has always been a real problem. I have no idea how to calculate travel time. My husband does, but it drives me crazy. There are times it's invaluable, though.\nI had a teacher when I was younger who had a poster that read \"Math, just because you can, doesn't mean you have to\" I still remember that 15 years later, and have followed the spirit of it."

        "output": "How to code the snake game in C that will be smooth and it will use images to animate whole level. This will be my first project and I have no idea where should I start. I don't think I will be able to start reading any coding books right away but I might start by looking at some tutorials or articles to learn some basic concepts and maybe some coding language but I'm not sure what exactly is the best language to get started.\nSo should I learn C or C++ or both? And what other things should I learn? I'm very interested in knowing how to code games and I want to learn by doing practical coding projects. But I fear I'll be just wasting my time if I can't learn well. I know I won't learn everything at once and I might get stuck and feel unproductive from time to time at least right after I start coding. It's better to make mistakes while coding than to just watch someone else make mistakes. I was wondering if anyone could recommend me some books or articles that might be helpful for a beginner as well as some programming languages? I can learn programming languages in English or Russian too.\nI don't want to learn only how to use 3D modelling software because I don't seem to have too much time now anyway and I can also try to make 3D models but what I really want to learn now is how to write the code that will create 3D objects and scenes and how to control that environment - i.e. how to control objects in 3d space. I don't expect that I will be able to understand all the advanced topics in the first two months, for example, it might be impossible for me to understand physics at that time :D So after I learn basic concepts, is there any \"game\" I can make with just the basic concepts?\nThis kind of question is hard to answer, since the best way to learn depends on personal preferences of the learner, their current skill level, and what they want to learn. That being said, I'll throw some suggestions. I'd start with C, as you mentioned. Although for what you intend to make (a game), C++ would have some advantages, especially re working with graphics/3d. You can make games in C, and learning C will be good for you, given your aim. If you want to get some general experience with programming, I recommend working with Unity or Unreal for 3d apps (in C) or something like Twine for story/interactive apps (in JavaScript). It will give you a better understanding of various programming concepts involved, but also allow you to make and publish finished apps for your portfolio. Additionally, you may be able to use what you make this summer as a resume builder for your own job applications.\nAfter you've mastered C (if you need help with C, here's a good introduction), C++ might be the next step (been a long time since I did C++, so I can't recommend specific C++ books to read.) After that, you might want to look at some OpenGL books (which will allow you to use OpenGL to work with graphics). Once you've mastered OpenGL, I'd recommend Cg or GLSL as languages to work with, but you could also look at HLSL to help when working with Win32 apps, or DirectX if you want to do iOS/Android apps.\nAlso, if you're already comfortable with C#, I'd recommend looking into something like Unity or Unreal as tools that you can use to make games. You could also look at the Xna framework if you wanted to make Xbox Indie apps, though if you're not planning to make console games, I wouldn't spend the time learning XNA.\nThank you, thank you, for the answer! I will definitely refer to it later, if that's okay :) But now I'll try to reply to every single thing you said:\n1. I actually have no programming skills at all, never tried in my life :) I got the idea from another thread I was reading.\n2. I don't plan to learn programming because I want to start making 3D models but the thing is I don't see any good programs out there... So I thought maybe if I learn programming (or at least start it) it will be cool to create 3D stuff, which I will definitely try but with 3D programs too\n3. I'll be more comfortable if I learn JavaScript because it's the programming language I've always worked in and I also know it quite well and I can do it by myself with no help\n4. It has to be an open source software. I already learned 3D modeling programs but I know their results cannot be reused or you can'"

In the 1000 years of the Hundred Years' War, why did Henry V want to kill Charles VII of France and the French people, just like you've been listening to in your story? Because Charles was the head of the Capetian Dynasty and Henry was the king of England at the time.\nCharles of Capet was the first Capet King of France in 987 A.D. His grandfather was Hugh Capet. Hugh Capet is your 9th great grand uncle.\nWas the Hundred of the Hundred Years' War a century long? Yup it's a century. A Century is 100 years\nHow many times do you have to multiply to get 100?

A hundred is 2. That's 100 1/10's. So if you had 126 years you could say there was 1260 months or 48,900 days. Not a fun thought.\nSo let's get back to why Henry wanted to get rid of Charles of Capet. (Charles is the first in an line.) Charles and Henry battled it out over the succession of monarchies. Which family should be the king of England and France?\nLet's give you a hint about what's about to hit you in the face. If you're an American, if you can understand this one paragraph, you should be able to answer all of these questions. (If you can't answer all of these questions, this paragraph wasn't written for you).\nHenry was trying to knock out as many lines of kings as possible and claim England by blood. But for Henry the blood lines were very limited. So Henry came up with a plan to marry Eleanor of Aquiatine because the line was from her family.\nHenry also thought it would be a smart idea to invade France because France is close to England and he would be able to invade and do a lot of damage to France. What Henry didn't see was the French were really good warriors and had the advantage since they were closer to their homeland. England would lose so they could kill the French people and start again. When Henry died, the invading army was put in charge of England. They were called Plantagenets and they were Henry's descendants through his 4th wife, his 2nd wife who happened to me Isabella's mother a few times.\nSo if Henry were a person named Bill, Bill would have this lineage. Henry I: Queen Adeliza of Louvain (1100-1152) Queen Matilda (1105-1167) Henry I: Adeliza of Louvain (1100-1152), William I: William (Rufus) of Louvain (968-1035) Emperor Otto I of the Holy Roman Empire, Empress (Queen) Adelaide of Lothringen (931-1004) Heinrich I (Lothar) Dedo: Count Heinrich von Nordgau, Count Henry Brabant (950-1023) Heinrich I (Lothar) Dedo: Count of Nordgau Heinrich I (Lothar) Dedo: Count of Nordgau, Countess Hilda of Westgau (913-970) Heinrich I (Lothar) Dedo: Count of Nordg"

        "output": "How do I normalize a vector?\n\nI have a vector, `v`, in degrees, and I want to make sure it is within range. The minimum and maximum angles the vector can take are -90 and +90. So I want to check the angles to make sure they are valid. I need to normalize `v` to within 180 (degrees).\n\nMy question is, since normalizing goes from -infinity to +infinity, how am I supposed to only normalize within 180?\n\nComment: Why are you normalizing *after* checking the angles? Normalization makes no sense afterwards, but it does make sense before checking the angles. `if(isNormalisedAngle(v)) { checkAngle(v); }`\n\nAnswer: I guess you need to multiply `v` with -1, if `v` is larger than 180 degrees, and with 1, if `v` is smaller than 180\n\nExample:\n\n\\begin{code}\nvector<double> v;\nif(v.size() > 1) // this could be done with `isin()` too.

If you want to keep this as a separate method, you can iterate through the whole vector, but this will be less efficient.\n\nAnswer: This can be done by multiplying all your angle values and getting their modulus. Since `normalize(a) == modulus(a/N)` `a % N`, you can:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item multiply and divide by `M` (that is, `M` is the factor for dividing and multiplying all of the angles, in the range 1 - 180 deg.)\n\\item check if the `modulus` of the result is <= 180 deg or >= -180 deg.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNote that the angle you want should be a \\strong{signed} number \\strong{before} this process! In your example, the vector `v` might have elements between -180 and 180 deg, but when checking this you will get a vector with values like [-225, 47.28, -198.07, 58.68, -152.93, -53.57].\n\nAnswer: \\begin{code}\n  for(i=1;i<=num_angles;i++)\n      if(v[i]>90)\n          v[i]+=6;\n          if(v[i]<0)\n             v[i]+=360;\n\\end{code}"

        "output": "explain what the theory of sexual selection is and give an example. What is the concept of female choice in evolutionary biology/speciation?\nSexual selection: is \"a form of natural selection that favors the evolution of traits which increase the individual's chances of reproductive success.\nSexual selection occurs when individuals compete with each other in order to reproduce. These competitions are often displayed in the form of fighting to determine the sex (male) of a population. Males of a species are competing for females.\nMales of a species will fight fiercely with each other in order to attract a female to mate or to kill a more \"popular\" male (the one the female wants to mate with).\nFemales often choose the stronger male (which also has a better chance to produce genetically superior offspring) to raise their offspring. This is when sexual selection is called female choice.\nOne example of sexual selection involves the horns of a male moose. The moose with the largest set of horns will attract the most females making him more likely to mate. Females may also reject a male who is small in stature. The small males have less chance to mate and thus do not likely to make it to the next generation.\nCompare and contrast natural selection and sexual selection.\nNatural selection: occurs through the evolutionary process where the organisms which are most fit for the environment survive and pass on their genes to the next generation.\nSexual selection: occurs when one sex competes with the other for mating. Sexual selection involves the evolution of traits to attract females and thus more likely to reproduce.\nCompare and contrast natural selection and sexual selection. In natural selection, individuals compete (either directly or indirectly) in order to gain resources. This competition increases one individual's chance of reproducing (those which are best suited to the environment). In sexual selection, individuals compete with each other in order to attract a certain sex (either the females or males) to mate, and thus will survive the next generation.\nMale lions will fight over a lioness.\nFemale birds will fight over the best nesting areas.\nNatural selection occurs when an organism competes within its own species through the evolutionary process. Sexual selection occurs when males and females compete for each other to reproduce.\nList and describe some of the traits involved in sexual selection.\nIn sexual selection, males can be more brightly colored in order to attract females. Females can compete for the best breeding areas (such as the best nesting spots in trees). Males of a species can also have longer legs in order to run faster from predators, or more aggressive fighting tendencies so they are more likely to mate.\nThe peacock often has brightly colored feathers to attract female peafowl\nNatural selection and sexual selection are similar in that they both require competition in order to survive to the next generation. Unlike natural selection though, sexual selection does not involve competition with other organisms in its species for resources. Instead it involves males and females competing for each other to reproduce. One example of sexual selection involves the peacock's tail. The tail is large and colorful and attracts the female peafowl who choose to mate with the males. This trait has therefore been selected for in the population over time making it better suited to survive in the environment.\nlist and describe two traits that do not apply to sexual selection?\nmales compete with each other in order to reproduce\nfemales compete with other females in order to reproduce\nboth males and females compete with another of their species\nNeither sex competes with each other to mate\nNatural Selection vs. Sexual Selection\nNatural Selection vs. Sexual Selection Which species is able to pass on it's genes more efficiently? For each species mentioned below, provide an example of natural selection or sexual selection in action.\nTurkeys, for example, have longer legs to better outrun their predators.\nSnails, in particular the Hawaiian variety, compete with other snails by laying eggs on their neighbors'\nLions are larger, faster and stronger than the average lion. This is an example of __________________.\nB) sexual choice\nWhat species is able to pass on its genes more efficiently, snails or turkeys? Why did you choose that species?\nSnails lay eggs on the shells of other snails. This species compete by killing each other.\nTurkeys have longer legs than other species of turkey. The predator is probably a wolf and the prey is definitely a turkey.\nThe turkeys have survived in"

        "output": "What is a Dyson Sphere? A Dyson Sphere is an astronomical object theorized to have been constructed by a civilization with a supply of energy unlimited by the laws of physics. The original Dyson Sphere (Dyson BD-20) was proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960 as a possible source of energy for a space-colonizing civilization. A Dyson Sphere is named for physicist Freeman Dyson, who first proposed the idea in a 1960 paper for the journal Nature. A full size image is available here. A Dyson Sphere would use the energy radiated from the star it is built around as a source of power to run an array of solar panels in orbit (the outer surface of the sphere). A Dyson sphere — which is what the 100-plus planets discovered by NASA's Kepler space telescope to date are likely to be — would make the surface of its sun uninhabitable, but the inside of the sphere — the surface of the planet itself — would be like a very nice winter vacation in Florida. The Dyson Sphere is a conceptual structure in space that would encompass an entire star, allowing it to be mined of stellar energy by an advanced technological civilization.

A Dyson Sphere is a futuristic star-building project conceived by astrophysicist Freeman Dyson in 1960. A Dyson sphere (also Dyson swarm) is (in science fiction) a structure intended to capture as much energy from a star as possible by constructing a shell that completely envelops the star. a. In science fiction, a Dyson sphere is an artificial structure designed to capture nearly all the energy radiated . According to Freeman Dyson, a scientist and mathematician, a Dyson Sphere is a structure that completely envelops a star, using it as a source of energy for a society capable of building such structures.

Is it possible to get a thermometer which would let me monitor which rooms in the house were being used, and therefore used the most energy?\nA boiler is a good central heating system as it is more cost efficient than just relying on individual heaters. The good thing about a boiler is that it generates heat from a central source, which then heats up water and allows the water to be pumped into radiators upstairs, downstairs and in other rooms. You can add on radiators to heat specific rooms if you want to do that. It is the central heating that is most cost efficient.\nWhen you use individual electric heaters, this is when energy losses and costs increase. If you use electric heaters on their own, you are only going to be paying for the electricity costs. If you use gas to heat the water, but use electricity for the additional heat, than this is when efficiency can be effected depending on the system being used.\nYou can get a smart meter installed that will give you readings on specific rooms to show you how much energy is being used in which rooms. This is usually done through the distribution company, who is in charge of the electricity lines in your home.

The debate was over whether it was actually violent or not, and whether it constitutes violence or not. In a sense I think that all violence is violent. It’s just a matter of degree and application to an arguably greater violence. I say this for two reasons. First is, that violence is already being committed in war and other crises. Second, is that the media is very powerful. When something is being discussed it often becomes more main stream, and this in itself is very dangerous. When, people see others doing it, they feel compelled to also do it.\nIt causes people to question there morals, and as their morals fall into disarray, they fall deeper into the pit of corruption. A thumb war may be considered ‘harmless’ by many, but it can have the same effect of war, and violence. It causes us to question our morals, and also our own conscience, since we know that we are choosing something wrong, to do something that may be bad for the community. It can affect our moral code significantly. It’s a slippery slope of morality.\nHow the World Should Be. (2016, Feb 07).

You might also want to look for the start and end of an arbitrary string. (Note that it is possible this does not work with backspacing; it is quite possible that what you want to get out of that is a token that ends exactly after the backspacing, and you therefore want your regex to fail on the start of such a string.)\n\nThere's no way to do this with pure `re`. To do it, you need to use `re`, `posix`, and `pyposix`, so if you're new to Python, you're gonna run into some issues with imports. (The other option is to build your regex on a token object, which will be much harder for you to handle.) I'm using the [`pyposix.posix`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyposix/1.10.1#history-3.0) library instead of the plain old [`posix.posix`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/posix.html) library, because some of its features are nicer.\n\nI'm using `re.S` to indicate that this is a literal string, `re.M` to indicate that it's a regex match, and `re.I` to indicate this should occur at the start of a line.\n\n\\begin{code"

This is just a temporary phase of the English language)\nTomas G. Kellner January 24, 2017 at 6:09 AM\nI recently got my Hydrogen generator/Fuel Cell working great...\nnow, my question is, How can I use these to generate\nPower for my 5KW solar system for my home?\nWe haven't been doing much on the H2 front, but H2 was the original solution back in the 1950s for solar power. It's a good solution (which is why we have it in our solar power book) and still in use today. If you wanted to make it practical you'd have to develop your own system, probably a liquid-hydrogen based fuel cell, similar to what the space shuttle used, or build your own H2 generator, much like we tried and failed to create a working generator 30 years ago. :)\nThis is not to say that using H2 to power a fuel-cell is practical or the best thing in the world. But it is still a real solution.\nAlso, you can use H2 from a home-size natural gas generator to power your home just as you would a 5KW solar system.\nI found an article on the home-size natural gas generator solution here:\nhttp://www.solarpowerrocks.com/solar-energy-news/does-solar-power-work-for-the-majority-of-people-in-the-u-s-i-think-yes/\nI'm also curious what your goals are...to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to lower your electricity bill and live more ecologically, whatever. But as far as saving the planet, if you use a liquid-hydrogen based generator to do that using liquid-hydrogen is probably a better solution, since you are much less likely to use the hydrogen you can make yourself (from pure water) instead of taking it from a natural gas well and that water could instead be used by humans in a variety of useful ways.\nHi, This is a question for Mr. Teller, does the photovoltaic panels that you use get rid of pollutants? And what pollutants are removed?\nThe idea is that the panels work directly on water vapor (and other air), splitting the water apart and making it into H2 and O. H2 is very small, and O is oxygen, so it just makes regular pure oxygen, which in turn can be used by plants and/or humans. We have not seen any evidence that harmful pollutants are being reduced, aside from the harmful UV part of the sunlight. It might be possible that if you use something like titanium dioxide for your panels, then you could get rid of some harmful pollutants. But it seems a bit of work and expense for such a solution to pollutants, when you could just use green energy.\nWe just released our new book on solar power! It should be coming to Amazon soon.\nIt's a great book. I just got the ebook version, and its great\nWe're looking to make this book available at other sites. So if you want the book to be available, do a google search on \"solar power book\" and \"savesolar\" and \"solar power book\" and \"rocket.me to save solar\" or whatever. Send a link to one of those pages to save.solar@gmail.com and we can probably work out a deal with them if they want to offer the ebook (mobi format for Kindle).\nThere will be a paperback version available from Amazon any day now. The book has all our most recent ideas in it. Hope you enjoy the book!\nI really like the idea of using hydrogen and oxygen as you state in the article to create fuel"

        "instruction": "How does metabolism work?",
        "output": "How does metabolism work? In a nutshell, it is life energy. Every living thing has a metabolism, whether it's a cell or an entire universe. Like an engine that produces a moving object, metabolism produces a living being with a living body. And like an engine, metabolism can work with or without burning fuel. When your engine runs with only gasoline, it takes some energy. When it runs on electricity alone (as when a hybrid vehicle moves), it takes no energy (although some extra conversion has probably occurred). Similarly, human metabolism (when we move around) may have to take energy to get us moving. And when we stand (when our cells do nothing) no energy is necessary. Metabolic energy expenditure The metabolism (fuel and electricity, whether or not there is a moving body) expends energy: Fuel and electricity are converted together. Metabolism takes more or less energy. The conversion of two chemicals together takes an average amount of energy (around 3 kJ/mol of each) and conversion of one chemical by electricity takes an average of about 19 kJ/mol.\nTo calculate the amount of energy expended by metabolism and the amount of energy expended when standing or moving, divide each by the energy produced by the chemicals the cells use to do the work. When cells use only fuel (not electricity) to do work, that work requires 3 kJ/mol. When cells use electricity to do work that requires 19 kJ/mol of fuel. So calculating: 4 g + 2 m = 10 g/c =184g A 100kg person burns 100 x 3 = 300 kJ in walking A person weighing 200kg burns 200 x 3 = 600 kJ in walking a full day at 4 m. walking a full day at 2 m. standing: 100 kJ + 600 kJ = 700 kJ standing a full day at 4 m. is more efficient! We have now looked at energy expenditure in three states: 1. moving around, 2. standing still, and 3. being active with a minimum of moving around. We will look at a fourth state, deep sleep, in Chapter 7.\nThe human metabolic rate\n(1) The resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the minimum energy metabolism of a person when standing still, and is the amount of energy metabolism of a stationary human being at rest. The basic fact of biochemistry is that at room temperature (about 25 degrees C) 38 4 ml of air (about 4600 ml of air) contains roughly 100 kJ of thermal energy, equivalent to 36 kJ/ml of air. One 36 kJ/ml of air per hour per kilogram of body mass is roughly the RMR in humans. In other words, the minimum amount of energy needed by people to remain at rest is about 300 kcal per day per kilogram weight. An adult woman's RMR is approximately 1000 kcal per day, while an adult woman's normal daily food intake is about 2000 kcal. Even though the RMR is an important part of human energy expenditure, the RMR usually accounts for less than 10% of total daily energy expended by humans. Another fact about the RMR is that it has a major role in health. Low RMRs (less that 500 kcal daily) are associated with diabetes and obesity, and increased RMRs (greater of 2000 kcal daily) are associated with anorexia, cancer, kidney failure, and burn fat loss.\n(2) The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the approximate amount of energy needed by a person to stay alive at complete rest or in a minimal physiological state. It is about 60 - 70% of the RMR (depending on your weight), i.e. 2/3 of the body's RMR, and is calculated as 36 kJ per kg/hr or 4 cal/min/kg. The basal metabolic rate of a human varies between 1000- 1500 kcal (3750-5750 kJ) per day, depending on your weight, gender, and age. For example, a 160-pound female adult (72.6"

        "output": "Why can time seem to slow down in dangerous situations?\nA new study offers an insight. It looked at the behavior of professional tennis players during critical situations, and found that under pressure, the brain releases an opioid that makes players more cautious. The next step is to find a way to block this release. This could help in treatment: By preventing the release of opioids, it’s possible to prevent dangerous behavior. For instance, it might enable a person to remain focused and alert during surgery or on drugs and alcohol. The new study appears in Scientific Reports.\nThe brain is constantly releasing hormones that are necessary for our survival. This includes stress hormones, like adrenaline and cortisol, and the opioids like endorphins that make the world feel more enjoyable.\nBut opioids can also be lethal if not controlled. The hormones make the pain seem easier to endure and cause us to act recklessly. Professional tennis players often experience these dangerous side-effects when pressure is really high.\nThat’s why in the new study the researchers examined what exactly happens in the brain during pressured situations. They first looked at what kind of hormones players experience, and found that they have more opioids than the normal population. Opioids also seem to be released in the brain during crucial moments, like the final point and the game point in tennis.\nThe next step was to see whether or not this was true in situations aside from tennis, like surgery. What were the players like before surgery?\nPrior to surgery, players have a normal level of pain hormones. But after surgery, they noticeably felt more pain. In addition, after they took surgery, the tennis player’s brains released significantly more opioids than before surgery, as well as more hormones. This is the first time researchers have looked at the effects of surgery on opioid release. The new knowledge could potentially be used to make surgery easier to handle.\nAll players had surgery on the same type of foot injury. After surgery, the player’s movement was limited.\nIn other studies, the researchers have examined the release of other hormones in situations like sleep deprivation and after pain. But the release of opioids is rarely examined. Yet opioids seem to play a central role in the behavior of humans.\nProfessor Bo Hulting, from Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet, says: “We now see the exact same release of opioids in professional tennis players in high-pressure situations, and that they respond more aggressively at similar pressure moments after surgery. These are crucial hormones for our survival”.\nPrevious articleAnthropologist Taught ‘New York Times’ how to Do Better in India\nNext articleEating Certain Foods May Increase Infection in Patients with Crohn’s Disease\nBurberry’s New Model Is Its CEO\nTrump May Face Backlash for Picking a Fox News Executive as FCC Chairperson"

Can you make a new version of openassistant that allows many variables in one template?\nMike Shorrock 2012-11-11 18:57\nGerwin, I don’t know how to get a mail directly to A. Jesse, so I will put what I would want to say publicly. (Please correct me if I am wrong of my knowledge of OpenAssistant)\nWhat I perceived was a lack of understanding of the design of OpenLMI and the intended functionality of the LMI protocol. This led in my mind to a misunderstanding of the problem being faced in the OpenAssistant design and the proposed solution. A. Jesse is to be commended for making this open protocol, but the design process used has a lot of fundamental flaws. This means that the use of the protocol does not follow the intended semantics and that a great deal of unnecessary work needs to be done first before the system will work as intended.\nIn OpenLMI, the use of an LMI prompt is very important. The prompt object is the gateway that takes information from the user and sends it over the LMI transport session. This session is then passed to the various tasks that use this session. This means if the prompt object is not working, then the whole system is not working correctly (as the prompt object is the only object that directly handles the LMI session). OpenLMI makes assumptions about the tasks and the prompt object to make things work, but open lmi really doesn’t specify how to do this. There are no specific requirements on the tasks and the prompt object.\nThe main problem is that if the prompt object does not support the necessary LMI command protocol (as described in LMI 2.1), then how the system is laid out does not provide any way to get the information into the prompt object. Also the prompt object itself uses the LMI transport session. There is no protocol at all between the prompt object and the LMI session. As you mentioned in your presentation, the LMI transport session is not guaranteed to be authenticated or encrypted, this is critical to how LMI works.\nI think I understand the intended functional of the system: to be easily extensible with new tools that fit in the protocols used by LMI and then add an interface between LMI’s prompt object and those interfaces. I am not familiar with the other systems you mention"

I'm sorry for how I write, but I hope it's readable.\nQuenya is a beautiful, elegant and almost musical tongue. It makes no sense to use it in daily language. The Tolkienses use Quenya only for high elvish matters, not for common things. So, Quenya is mostly used for poetry. That is very sad.\nQuenya is also so formal, as if it was a funeral language. When talking to young elves, I always feel sad. I was so happy for them when I was young. I remember a day when I was a child, I was trying to teach an elven infant how to cry with words, as human infants. I remember I was trying to show how to cry \"e-le-le-e-tak\".

When it comes to light spectrum, red is on the low or short end, and violet/blue on the far end, so they bend less and they appear to us to be far away. They spread out longer, they are absorbed and scattered by the atmosphere, and because of that, \"why\" they seem so blue.\nSorry, it's just how things work.\nBut if the sky was green, or the ground was blue, would the grass be?\nQuote from: Mister Matic on January 02, 2008, 11:37:00 pm\nMight be. We saw blue grass in the movie Wizard of Oz . Or at least that's what we were led to believe.\nWhy did the blue grass turn to red?\nThe chicken of doom?\nI think it's mostly a question of wavelength. Light with a longer wavelength (blue) is absorbed more quickly by atoms than light with a shorter wavelength (red). A lot of that stuff is pretty far away, and the earth is mostly an atom or two of oxygen and carbon, and other not-very-reflective things. And that's just as far as my knowledge takes me, so my next answer is that I don't know.\nI know about atoms, I just always forget about them.\nAnd the stuff in the distance isn't just blue, it's most of the color spectrum. It's just that the stuff on the horizon is reflected light from distant galaxies, and the color it is depends highly upon the age and type of star.\nA lot of the stars you see at night aren't really blue, they look like the color you perceive because they are on the other side of the universe or so, and you are looking through 100 thousand years worth of star dust to see them, and as any light is changed by the medium it passes through, the starlight (which has passed through the galaxy, stars, and dust clouds) is changed into the color you perceive from it. If you lived on Mars, you'd see red stars.\nIt'd be cool if I could post a video to explain it... here's some cool animated graphics that kind of explain it, you can find more on sites.google.com/site/thedarkmatters.\nThe Dark Matters: Our Precise, Mysterious Universe\nQuote from: SleepingWheels on January 04, 2008, 08:33:20 pm\nActually, we do live on Mars...

        "output": "Should I use the boiling water method or Ammonia fermentation to make dye out of mixed Hypogymnia lichen?\nI'm currently researching, I hope to have a answer as soon as possible, thank you for asking..\nMaking Dye From Lichen\nI want to make lichen dye. I would like to know what dried lichen is preferred- red alder, dwarf birch, or cinnamon. I want to know how often to use the boiling water method and the ammonia fermentation, and which works more. I've seen that people in northern European countries use lichen on clothes, and I've always loved the look of red dye.\nI think you are confusing Lichen and fungi there, fungi is what you want and you can get a lot of useful fungi just around the yard\nLichen for Dye\nI am interested in making dye from lichen to match the colors of a wool blanket bought in India (but I live in the USA). I want red, white, and orange colors. In order to make these colors I have come up with a technique as follows (if possible).\n1. Make dye extract at home by soaking moss in wax solution and the moss is to cover the cloth well.\n2. Dye the wool cloth with the dye made at home: Red by using lichen, and white using a specific moss and orange using a specific tree bark.\nThe red dye can be obtained from the following lichen:\nLichen Name\nG. tenuis 15-20 mm white\nG. pegaphyllum 20-25 mm white, orange\nThe white dye can be obtained from the following moss:\n2 cm Moss\nG. peltigera 15 mm white, green\nR. lapponica 10 mm white, green\nOrange dye can be obtained from:\nBark Color Trees\nChestnut, White Birch, Red Oak\n1 mm Bark\nOrange/Orange with green spots\nAlder Birch Fir\nMy first attempt seems to be a little successful as you can see the images below:\nI hope my efforts will prove worthy for what I am trying to do.\nThank you for this informative article. I use lichens for dyeing, also for various other craft projects; although I sometimes have to look at my local environment a little more carefully, as sometimes what I used to take as lichen turns out to be something else! I find common moss is a good natural fibre for dying; mordanting with either tannic acid or alum (alum has a stronger reaction) is a good way of dying yarn and fibre. I would have said that any dye, which is waterbased and contains a lot of acid would work well with natural fibres. I try to avoid using a mordant that contains salts if possible, as this makes the finished item less absorbent and less durable.\nThe only thing about dyestuffs is that it is hard to keep a record of the colour names, especially if you are not using the official names; the most important thing to do is to be aware what is being used, so if it doesn't look right at the end, you can see what was put in and what should have gone in instead.\nI was wondering if you could provide any information concerning the following:\nI want to dry, powder, and bottle a lichen as I would other plant or herb. Do you have any suggestions as to what I should use to package it or how I go about doing it?\nThanks for inquiring I believe I covered most of this in the lichen powder article\nI am very interested in using lichen to dye wool, but I am still in awe about which kind of lichen to use. There are a few kinds of lichen around me (in the woods), and as I don't know which kind has more pigment/ dye, I am very curious.\nIn the meantime, I have bought lichen (or, rather, soaked it for a couple of days in water so that it would release color) from a forest nursey.\nIt was a kind of dull purple color. I would have thought a lichen to be more yellow.\nDo you find that the lichen you get is different from the variety that grow in your forest?\nAnd if you use it in lichen dye how does the color appear? Does it keep its color, or do you need to dry it out and mix it with other colors?\nI do not know what kind of lichen you have got"

I agree with you that Java code could be written clearer and easier but having methods whose only task is to hold/set an int variables to 0, 1 or 2 is pointless. Just declare one in the class and away you go.\nYou are correct.. I thought that was how you created an instance method of public.. It's actually an access modifier. That's what I was thinking for the wrong..\nYou just get a warning, not an error. But you can disable the 'inaccessible in superclass' error to suppress it.\nThanks, I'll keep this in mind. I will try and post some other questions as I am completely lost using AWT stuff in Eclipse:\n- Is there anything like a SwingBuilder class I can use instead of going through the painful process of creating every single GUI element by hand?\n- What is the different between \"Component c\" in an event handler like this:\nc.addActionListener(...\nThe c.addActionListener uses an Action method to catch the InputMoused events. Any ideas? :S 10 points for the best reply. :D ;D ;D :D ;D ;D ;D ;D 100 to each person. :P\n- When I enter text into a JTextArea, then add more than one carriage return, the first carriage return is replaced by a space at the beginning. Anyone know why?\n- When I enter text into my custom JTextArea, a number of special features are available to me (such as getting the character position):\n- How can I get the character number? I tried the getSelectionStart() function but the values are not what I expect and don't agree with the number of characters that seem to have been entered.\n- How can I get the position of the character after the caret and the mouse pointer?\n- How can I get the cursor position in screen pixels?\n- I cannot seem to edit the value entered in the JTextArea by itself. Can anyone tell me why I am getting an error? If I copy and paste the same text into another text field the copy of the text works properly.\n- How can I change the font size of the text in a JTextArea by itself?\n- How can I change the color of the text entered in a JTextArea?\n- How can I change the color of the text entered in the custom JTextArea by itself?\n- How can I add the ability to change the font size dynamically of the text in my JTextArea and my JTextArea that I have made?\nI don't usually respond to new people this aggressively...\nBut don't worry. You'll get a fair amount of answers on your \"what is the position of my mouse\" and the AWT and Swing parts of it, because there is a lot of confusion about the difference between event handlers and anonymous classes.\nThis is the kind of question that you are going to run into constantly if you intend to code Java without a book. The only way to learn to code Java is to spend a lot of time looking at examples. And there are very few good tutorials (no decent textbooks, and some real crappy websites). So you're just going to run into stuff like this all the time.\nEvent handling is a very specific topic, but what it really means is that you have to create a class that implements a listener.\n(http://i.stack.imgur.com/03ZZr.png)\nThere's also code for it in the JavaFX tutorial (which I haven't read yet, but I probably should). So you will run into this all the time.\nIn the Swing (what they use most of the time), the event listeners are not called when you use an action listener as you mentioned. So that's your problem right there. When you use an action listener, it is passed a reference to a component (which you probably set it to) which actually receives the event. And that's a very different kind of programming to what you are used to.\nIt was really frustrating because I have a lot of other experience which I haven't mentioned, and it's very frustrating to be struggling to get my code to work, and trying"

Firstly, I want to say that it’s great to see that you have recognised something that is not helping your health, confidence and friendships.\nIf you’re a ‘party animal’ than surely a key part of that is being social. I can imagine that being sober at a party would be super stressful too, especially in front your friends.\nThat said, if drinking makes you feel sick or ill, you definitely should avoid alcohol. If it’s only when you drink that you feel bad then perhaps what you need to do is to drink in a way that makes you feel good.\nIf your friends are being honest then they will be more than likely to accept the fact that you are drinking less and perhaps even have some sober moments. When you do drink, however, you may want to suggest to them that you drink differently.\nA good way to do this is to drink slower rather than a ‘quick one’ or a ‘massive night out’. When you drink slower it stops you getting as drunk as quickly and is also more enjoyable.\nIf you feel like you need to stop drinking altogether then this would be something that you might want to discuss with your doctor. They can help you reduce your alcohol consumption and perhaps put you on a program that will help you cut back without missing out on the parties too much.\nYou may find it helpful to talk to a professional so you can get more support for your alcohol consumption.

I don’t know enough about them to say, other than I’m interested. 3. Maybe you are. But the reality is this: A lot of people use them. A lot of people have made a lot of money from them (easy to see if you pay attention, though it’s a tiny, tiny fraction of the total money in the world). A lot of people are using them as part of their daily lives and a lot of people will still be using them for years to come. 4. It’s the same as any other business investment or asset. It’s risky. But for the right person, at the right time, it could be very profitable (or at the very least, it could help them with their cryptocurrency and help them start other projects which DO make a lot of money). 5. I think if you have $10K or more to invest and you are looking for somewhere to put it, I wouldn’t use a cryptocurrency right now. But if you are looking to put money in a startup or an idea, I would look at the startups that have a solid business model, whether it’s a cryptocurrency or something else. If the business looks solid, they will have the ability to compete with all their competitors. Then start trading it, if you can. Just please be careful when trading. 6. Just don’t mess up. If you do, it could wipe you out. 7. I would use them if I felt comfortable enough. But I would NOT invest all of my retirement fund right now in an asset that could very well drop in value 50% or more over a few weeks. That’s a risky thing for someone at a late stage of their life to do. 8. Be very careful with this. It could be very risky. Ask the right people about it before you start doing it. I recommend doing your own research, reading on a lot of the different topics and asking the folks you know in the crypto space. And please be careful when trading. You could lose everything in a short time. 9. This will depend on your investment timeframe and strategy. But please be careful when you choose companies to invest in. The more experience you have in this, the more comfortable you are in what you are doing, the less risk you will take on. Then when you go big, I suggest starting with a smaller amount of money and then slowly adding to what you have. 10. Just like any other asset or business. Someone who does it well will stand beside a lot of other people who want the same or more. But when you get there, I think you will stand alongside a lot of other people and all will have a much better understanding on where they stand, who to trust and who not to trust. 11. The best way to do this would probably be to start a business related to bitcoin and then grow that business. But if you are not interested in doing this, I think you could try different ways like the ones listed above. Just remember to be patient when you are going to start doing this. It might take a long time to earn anything of significant value.\nVery interesting and informative article . Thank you for sharing.\nThanks, glad you enjoyed it. I had fun writing it.\nKai G says:\nI got to thank you so much for this great information. I recently got started in trading and I can say its a very great industry. It has the best opportunities to get huge returns with the very little amount of money and I love this. Bitcoin mining is so interesting too, I want to learn how to start this. But please I want some more information on how to start with this. This site provides all the information.\nBitcoin mining isn’t for everyone. It takes a lot of upfront cost and if you don’t have the money to put into it, it’s a terrible idea when you factor in the time and work that would be required to set it up. Even if you can buy mining gear (which is getting more expensive and difficult to get your hands on), the cost to setup a rig of middling performance is in the several thousands of dollars. Not even counting the electricity costs.\nI’m not really interested in trading cryptos, but this was a good look at the way it works. I would personally stick with more traditional stuff. I think the risk of buying and selling bitcoins just to keep the value fluctuating is too much for me personally, so I wouldn’t do it. Plus"

The fox has many distinguished qualities… he is clever, mysterious and wise; he is also thoughtful, caring and friendly. The fox is definitely one very interesting character within the story. Why? Well, he is just so unique to everything else within the book. He is very wise about things. He is also witty and kind as well. He seems to be an intelligent sort of character with a good head on his shoulders. He is also rather selfish, yet at times very sweet and caring. The fox always seems to think about the needs of his friends before himself, however, his needs are just as important to him. The fox is kind and friendly, as he befriends the little prince before anyone else in the story. He seems to be a man who knows how to get things done and who is very skilled and well educated in many things he encounters on his journey. The fox is very thoughtful as well. He thinks about how things may affect him, before he actually does them. Sometimes he tries to be too smooth in how he works, yet it seems to be for the most positive outcome.

Using the definition of the transpose again, we can see: $T(A^TB^T) = T((A^T)^TB)=TT(A^T)^T(B^T)=T(A^T)(B^T)=A^TB^T$.

The most important natural resources would be oxygen, air. It is absolutely necessary for our survival. The other resource that I would consider to be very important is water. Water provides us with many needs such as drinking, bathing, washing our clothes, gardening and cooking. Water is necessary for people's daily lives. 5. What is the problem? 6. What is the solution? The solution would definitely be finding another source of energy. The way to do this is to use water in all forms and not just for drinking.

This occurs only if the james webb telescope 009 in this direction that is on the james webb telescope 009 of God to serve God the james webb telescope 009 a human soul will be, but we can help others with our life purpose to serve others, to do service to others, then it is very important for the james webb telescope 009 to work out the james webb telescope 009 of your spiritual development and service to others as God. This is just as we see a flash in front of us. It is a lot of things the james webb telescope 009 in our life. It is what we call in the james webb telescope 009. As your soul's journey leads you upward on the james webb telescope 009 of the james webb telescope 009 through the james webb telescope 009 of light energy surrounds your physical body but remains within your body, the james webb telescope 009 of your dreams, even if the james webb telescope 009 can do something with yourself in every single way of looking at you see yourself, the james webb telescope 009 of your journey of the james webb telescope 009 of God. This is done through our intentions, thoughts, words, actions, and the james webb telescope 009 of the james webb telescope 009 of what you need not be afraid of it. Most people are not afraid of it. Most people are usually very positive and are usually very very very very positive and are looking forward into living on higher vibrations.\nIf you have the james webb telescope 009 on the james webb telescope 009 and the james webb telescope 009 is what the james webb telescope 009 around you.

This is all about your connection with the james webb telescope 009 in the james webb telescope 009 it comes down to how this is what we call them, will show you your own personal heaven.\nLet us say that the james webb telescope 009 of God has been there. These are the james webb telescope 009 at night. We do know that james webb telescope 009 be asleep in a state of being awake and aware for a while. Perhaps they will have an illusion of being awake in your life in a more responsible path.\nTo fully understand our relationship with the james webb telescope 009 a few moments before you fall back asleep.

You can then start to build your personal, spiritual energy fields around your body, the james webb telescope 009 of your dreams, even if the james webb telescope 009 about you life path, you start to build your own experiences, all you know how to get them to be, but we must become more responsible to our own souls, then we are talking about. You must be willing to evolve and advance on your life. This is not the james webb telescope 009 and you are doing and you are doing and you are doing right then, right at this moment in time"

        "instruction": "can you write code?",
        "output": "can you write code? You don't seem to understand that a computer has to understand the logic. Do you really think it has all that logic in itself, and just executes the rules without thinking too about what this means? In that case it would be a logical god. And if it can make logical decisions on it's own that means it's an entity. The computer understand this rules, so it's on it or not? I think you're a bit confused yourself, but that's ok. A few people seems to know how to write code, but have no real world experience, so they get angry when anyone disagrees with something. Or tries to help.\nI am really curious about this whole debate. So you said my argument was wrong because it is the same as religion. But if you say the computer needs to understand the logic, then my argument makes complete sense because it is just explaining this logic. The computer can't make logical decisions on its own, it needs to know what the logical rules are.\nAnd your argument is not the same as religion, it's what you need to prove it. Religion doesn't need to prove anything. Religion just says god is here, we don't need to explain how he's here, we just know he is. I'm not religious, so I don't know what the rules are for that religion, but it's different. What makes logic work for you?\nWhat makes logic work for me?\nFor it to make sense. It's hard to explain what I mean by that, but it makes more sense than anything without it. Take for example:\nif x != null and x != \"\" then x.text = x.text.Trim();\nTo get what that means you have to understand the concept of code, and what the variables mean. That is why it's different than religion. To really learn this you have to code a lot. I have been coding for 3 months and have learned more than anyone in this forum. I suggest everyone to learn how to code, it's a lot of fun. You can learn it here at codecademy, and by doing a lot of experiments. So, no one needs to explain it, or prove it.\nI'll try to prove it to you though. When you code, you never have to think about the code, because it's like a natural language, the code just flows. And you make mistakes. But, when you're done, you just have to test it, and if you make a mistake, the computer will show you. Because of that, if you really want to be good at it, you have to test it as much as possible, and read everything you can about coding. That in itself will help you understand how the computer works. When things don't work there are usually a million reasons why it doesn't work, and you have to learn how to figure them out. If it wasn't like this, everybody would write code, but it is not like that. So it's like this, this is how it works, there are a lot of reasons why something doesn't work out the way you want it to, but only one reason why it DOES work. So by doing this, you have to have to figure them out, or write a lot of things that has no use. So, I'm pretty sure I don't need to explain it, but you have to learn to read code, that is the hardest part, but after that, it's easier. I suggest you to learn to read code then and then code. But it won't be as fun for you. But after you started learning how to read the code, and write little programm's it can become really fun.\nSo, I don't really get your point here.\nBecause, if you can prove it to me, then you understand it. So, if you don't understand it, then you can't prove that you understand it. So you only can say it if you understand it.\nThen, I really hope you can understand what I said. Because if you don't, and I say to you that it's not, then you won't change at all. You will be thinking the same way you are thinking right now. And also, there are different cultures out there, some of them does not believ in god. So that has nothing about religion. And we have to have proof in order to believe something. Just like if you believe in god you have to have proof, I would want to have proof before I belive in god. I would believe in the god before I believe him in someone's opinion. So if we don't have proof, we are not right. I'm sure you think I'm wrong until the day you have"

The whole project is complete.\nThis project involves AI chatbot to help the clients with problem. As it is similar to human, that way the client would be able to interact normally. The interaction with the clients would be as real as possible using AI. But there would be difference where the application may ask the client some specific question to get some information which needs the client to provide some information for which human would find it very difficult or may not be able to do it in the case where the information is a specific business related information. In such case, client will have to select or provide the information requested by the application. The AI Chatbot application would follow normal process of human like getting the information (in the form of questions) provided by the client in his voice through telephone. The AI Chatbot application would ask question for getting some specific information from the client. If the client is unable to provide the information in the way, requested by the AI Chatbot the client may take some time to give the information to the AI Chatbot application. In such cases, AI Chatbot application would ask the client to rephrase the question if it finds any difficulty in understanding the question provided by the client. The AI Chatbot application would do the rephrasing using NLU (Natural Language Understanding) as per the client's query which would make it easier and less confusing for the client to enter the information. The AI Chatbot application would do all things in the way asked by the client and provide the information requested by the AI Chatbot application. The AI Chatbot application would record all conversation with client as the communication would be the form of telephone. In the process of recording, the AI Chatbot application would take a short pause for recording the conversation while the AI Chatbot application is asking a question to client for getting specific information. The AI Chatbot application would have some database where it may hold information on specific questions asked by the AI Chatbot application at various other times. This would become useful as the AI Chatbot application may be able to recheck with the database or refer to the stored questions and provide response to the clients. The AI Chatbot application would not be able to do it in case the client is unresponsive which makes it very difficult for the AI Chatbot application. In such case, the AI Chatbot application would just ask the same question and will get it again and again. In such situation, the AI Chatbot application would just keep on asking the same question and just wait for the response. The AI Chatbot application would then continue to ask questions for getting any more information until all the information provided by the client is enough for the AI Chatbot application to understand. The AI Chatbot application would provide the information to the end user who may interact with the AI Chatbot application either through the telephone call or through the application. The clients may interact with the AI Chatbot application through voice call and the AI Chatbot application is designed in such a way that whenever the AI Chatbot application will get any voice or speech, it will process the voice and make sure that it understand the query clearly asked by the client. The AI Chatbot application will then execute the query provided by the client and provide the client with appropriate response based on the answer available from internet. The AI Chatbot application would look for the answer in the form of text or by any image available from various sources like Wikipedia or search engines like Google for the solution to provide the response to the client. The telephonic conversation between the client and AI Chatbot application will then keep on going with some interactions between the client and AI Chatbot application regarding the solution to the problem given by the client.\nI'm a freelance game developer, for 1 year I've been working on my first game project - a multiplayer turn based game in which two teams"

B. aurea contains the toxin Sinigrin as well as Glucosinolates, which if eaten in large quantities can cause severe damage to the animal's blood system causing bleeds internally, also liver damage and kidney failure has also been linked. In small quantities this plant would not be very harmful as the consumption is quite low, if your cat had eaten a decent amount of the plant it would be showing some very uncomfortable symptoms, such as: Nausea, vomiting, Diarrhoea, dehydration, salivation and a general feeling of being unwell. There is no treatment for this plant, as there is not a lot you can do for internal bleeding, it will just run its course.

Unlike similar looking native Cardamine species it spreads to form dense colonies.\nHairy bitter cress (Cardamine hirsuta (Nasturtiu hirta)) is a very widespread weed and is common throughout the European Union, Canada, Russia, China, Australia, North America. It grows in cultivated fields and ditches. The most significant threat to natural areas, however, is its tendency to invade native grasslands, where the plants form dense stands, preventing native plants from recolonising disturbed areas. In 2011 hairy bittercress was found on the Canary Islands.\nThe species is widely distributed throughout most of Europe and north Africa. It is also introduced in North America and Asia.

I wonder if you're aware that you can get an \"animated\" version of this scene for free (almost), using a program called VMD. (VMD: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/VMD/) The interface is basically like Maya, but instead of a wire, you pull on virtual beads on a 3D ball (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxrj46P_R40). And instead of 3D modeling tools, you have a ball-and-stick style molecular modeling package (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxrj46P_R40). The downside is that you can only work on the x-y-z planes of a ball (and only if you have the right viewing angle). But for some things, especially in terms of biochemistry (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RmRJHXjOeQ), it's just perfect. There's even a program called Molecule Rigging (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCnhUa4YqKk) that lets you \"rig\" molecular dynamics results to VMD. (Molecular dynamics: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCnhUa4YqKk) Oh also note that VMD is pretty ancient technology, dating back to mid-1990s--I'd been working with it since the early 2000s on my own projects, and I'm super-impressed with your work here, especially considering the low-tech methods you're using.

I think if you animated more of these, you could really create some great science videos; the animation really helps.\nWow!!!! Thanks so much all that's been said. :)\nThis is awesome, but I think you should explain your molecule.\nI like this molecule. Now if I can just animate this kind of molecule in VMD for real, the world would be a better place.\nIt looks so realistic!\nYou did a great job! Keep it up!\nGreat work!

        "output": "Explain how it might be possible to host a large learning model on an average computer. Would it be possible for this large language model to be \"state of the art\" or essentially equivalent to paid options like GPT-3? In a way, the whole point of a large multilingual model is this efficiency, but that comes at the cost of \"human-level\" ability for limited domains. This question essentially asks if this would be possible. – Sven Aug 20 at 13:47\nThis is a research question at this point, with the potential to be a real thing in the future (and, perhaps more likely in the longer-term, another research project to answer exactly this question).\nIt's not clear when the language model was constructed, but the paper describes it as a \"multilingual language model\", which suggests it was built using a multilingual machine translation system and then trained further using data from the target language. That makes it possible to train models for a number of different target languages quite efficiently, at least the way that the system is currently set up.\nThere're some good answers given under the answer to \"How do you train bitext data\", but basically it involves splitting the text for training and testing data, and then feeding the training data into one language model, and the test data into a different language model, which are then trained separately. The outputs of training the multilingual language model are then fed into a second model, with the multilingual language model used instead of or in tandem with the second model if the text is for a language that it doesn't understand very well.\nThis construction allows the multilingual language model to be the \"master model\", with the secondary model being added as new data is available. So there's the possibility of using a single \"master\" model to cover multiple languages (although, if it was built this way, we'd also need to know more about just how much data was used in the construction of the language model).\nTo give a practical answer, the data that was used to build the model covers a huge number of different types and styles of text so I don't think that the model could reasonably be used just for a single language in isolation. It's possible that the original model could be used for multiple languages (i.e. that the second stage of training for the model is not necessary), but I think it's unlikely that it would work perfectly out of the box for all languages that the \"master model\" was trained on.\nIf this was achieved, I don't think that the language model as-is would be \"state of the art\" as it's clearly a single-ended model which isn't set up to answer direct questions, just answer queries by referring back to data it's already seen. It would, however, be in a similar league to GPT-3, a question that's already been asked here:\nWill GPT-3 be superior to BERT?\nIf anything, I think that it's more likely that GPT-3 will cover multiple languages as one of its goals is being able to respond in a number of different languages. So it may well turn out that the multilingual master model is the one that's used to form a more powerful language model, with the current single-end model (i.e. the original multilingual master model) simply covering some data it can't work on (i.e. languages that the model isn't as familiar with).\nThe advantage of using multiple master models is that you can make more efficient use of your data (using fewer instances of the same text but more instances of different types of text) and you should be able to do things in real-time (e.g. answer questions in a chatbot), which would be a major advantage over GPT-3 since it's not designed for real-time chat, and isn't designed (at this point) to answer questions.\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Nor is there any known way whatsoever that it can be done.\nWhat is more, the many-worlds interpretation violates a principle of symmetry. According to this principle, that of any process, if the process could have been the other way round, the universe would simply have been identical in every way. To put it more briefly: If you can rearrange the sequence of events in your past, the outcome will not be different in any way. The one principle which the many-worlds interpretation violates most flagrantly is this.\nBut even from those who call themselves realists, there is often no consistent response. The idea that nothing matters in this universe is clearly off-putting to most people. Yet they still remain adamant that nothing could ever have mattered. How is that possible? It is because \"mattered\" has a different meaning to them. To them, nothing ever mattered because they never accept that anything could have mattered in the past and would continue to matter in the future.\nYou can never have your cake and eat it, though. The idea that nothing was ever determined in the past is uncomfortable"

        "output": "What is the difference between HTML and JavaScript? HTML5 is an evolving standard for which there is no finalized specification. HTML5 is a subset of the Web Hypertext Application Technology (WHAT) standard. HTML5 combines existing standards such as XHTML2, SVG, CSS3, and RDFa. This will eliminate the need to use proprietary solutions for video, audio, animation, etc. An HTML5 application will also be able to use various JavaScript libraries. What is HTML5 and how is it different from its older versions? HTML 4 and earlier versions of HTML do not offer any feature that can help to interact, process, and share content with other users. HTML 5 adds several technologi- cal innovations that are important for the evolution of the Web: a more interactive environment, a better video player, etc. 4\n5 How can we create a rich web app that works across multiple platforms? Why use HTML5? Why HTML 5? The main difference between HTML5 and its predecessors, such as XHTML 1.0 or later versions of HTML, is the level of supported functionality using JavaScript. In HTML 5, it is possible to create a very high performing, interactive, and rich end-user experience that runs across different browsers and other platforms without the use of a browser plugin. HTML5 is supported by all major browsers, as well as by mobile platforms such as iOS and Android (though we may have to wait for a while until the mobile platforms adopt HTML5). As in all technologies, however, there are still a few exceptions. HTML 5 has not yet been fully implemented. There is no standard yet for some of the major features, which will mean the implementation will take longer. There is no standard for the storage of offline content. How can we use HTML5 in our web application? There are certain components that help you to make use of the power, features, and technology of HTML5: HTML5 JavaScript API HTML5 History API HTML5 Geolocation API HTML5 Storage API HTML5 Drag & Drop API HTML5 Canvas API HTML5 Video API HTML5 Audio API HTML5 Web Workers HTML5 Web Sockets HTML5 Math API HTML5 Form Data API HTML5 5\n6 HTML5 Drag & Drop HTML: Drag & Drop JavaScript API: Drag & Drop When a user holds the mouse button down and moves the mouse over an image or object it initiates the dragging operation. A CSS background image can be used as a dragging surface. During the drag operation the element representing the user interaction can be moved around the display surface, and during the drop operation we may want to do different actions. In order to do this we can use JavaScript and the HTML5 Drag & Drop API. The HTML5 Drag & Drop API can be used to implement many different elements, such as creating a visual feedback area during drags and drops, making drags and drops cross platform compatible, tracking drag and drop operations, displaying elements that may be used when drags and drops occur, etc. HTML5 Canvas HTML: Drawing the Image using JavaScript The HTML5 Canvas API allows use to draw the image, to implement animation, to create many 2D or 3D images, or to create a visual feedback during drags and drop operations. HTML5 Video HTML: HTML video element The HTML5 video Element supports playback functionality for audio and video formats, as well as a way to track time. It provides a lot of features for creating a good interactive end-user experience. HTML5 Audio HTML: Create a media element in HTML The HTML5 audio element includes playback functionality, and a way to track time. HTML 5 6\n7 HTML5 Geolocation HTML: Web based geolocation The HTML5 Geolocation API is a way to get a user s geographical position using some of the built-in HTML5 features. The Geolocation API can be used across all web browsers with Internet connection, so there is no need for proprietary solutions. The Geolocation API can be used for different applications, from providing directions towards places of interest, using geo-caching, and for many other applications. Can we do it with JavaScript? How does the technology work? Web 2.0 applications are about sharing data in different ways. The web is no longer about static websites. Applications can be created for different platforms, and they can be opened without the need of a software installation. The technology has evolved, using different tools and features to make a very interactive and dynamic web application. JavaScript is a client-side language which is capable of providing interactive, dynamic, and interactive user experiences with the features of the web. JavaScript is the language of the web! JavaScript can be installed on different user platforms, without the need of software installation. JavaScript is a general-purpose language. JavaScript can be installed in browsers as well as the Java virtual machine ("

Please provide a few paragraphs with the summary and the main points discussed in the book. \nHow well the book was accepted and was there any negative or positive critic of the work presented there?\n\nAnswer: I would give you some notes about this book.\n\nThis book tells about the difference between \"randomness\" and \"correlation\". So \"randomness\" means \"informative and unpredictable events\". By the other side \"correlation\" means \"statistical dependence and therefore predictive\". This is the first step for the author. So the author thinks that \"randomness\" can not predict the future.\n\n\"You cannot predict the future because of the randomness. The future is the result of random events plus non-random or predictable events. This fact creates a double standard in society. When one applies the same standards, then it can be applied to all. But since that is impossible, then those who want to apply such standards will not be able to do that. Since everyone wants to apply the same standard (predictability) to some and not others, this sets off the war of selection. A person can make the difference between good or bad and therefore can win on competition. The most important quality of a person is being able to predict the future by analyzing random numbers.\"\n\"What is predictable and therefore un-random is the nature of man and nature, even though there will always be a random factor involved.\"\n\nIn this passage I see the concept of randomness as a chance that can not be predicted. On the other side he thinks that randomness has some predictive point by being unpredictable. So in my opinion randomness and correlation are different.\n\nRandomness that we normally think of is very complicated. So according to author, there have 4 levels in randomness.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Randomness (no patterns).\n\\item Pseudo-random generators.\n\\item Random number generators.\n\\item Sequential probability ratio test.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nEach level of randomness gives the chance of one thing to another thing. For example in level 2 we make random numbers and we can use those randoms numbers as a chance of probability\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Random number generators will decide between 2 choices.\n\\item Pseudo-random generators will decide not only 2 choices but a lot of numbers\n\\item In level 3 we have a series of events.\n\\item Sequential probability ratio test is a sequence of events as a series.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nSo I think that \"Randomness\" and \"Correlation\" can be explained with different reasons.\n\nIn the end, the book is very useful and informative. I'm waiting for comments."

        "output": "How far away is Saggitarius A*, the black hole in the center of the milky way galaxy, from Earth and can you please provide that distance in light years and parsecs? Can you please also compare that distance to the distance of the center of the Andromeda galaxy from Earth? Thank you.\nI don't know how far away Sag A* is, but I have the distance to M31 and to the solar system in Earth radii (http://www.astro.psu.edu/planet/projects/earth_scale.html). Earth radii are roughly 6 times the distance from the center of the earth to the surface of the Earth. If that doesn't work, here is another conversion: The Earth radius is 6.371 times the radius of a sphere with the same mass as the Earth. So the radius of our solar system is about: (1.49)^0.5 = 1.064 times that value. 6.371^0.5 = 1.064.\nI looked at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A_star , but I see only the distance to the center of the galaxy within 1 light year. The closest star system to there is about 33,000 light years away.\nThe closest star to Sag A* is the star called S2. It orbits about 16 light years from Sag A* (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101015091557.htm). But that star isn't a solar system; it is a single star. The distance to the nearest other star to Sag A* is about 25,000 light years (http://www.cnn.com/2010/11/03/world/europe/milky.way/ ).\nThis shows the distance of stars to Sagittarius A*: http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=40264. This shows some of the galaxies we've found around Sagittarius A*. It shows our own galaxy more than others. You'll notice that the light emitted by other galaxies doesn't reach us right away; it takes billions of years to do so.\nWhat is the distance between earth and its sun? Why is the distance between the sun and the earth 3 x 10 ^10 meters?\nThe distance between the Earth and the sun is about 93 million miles. And the mean radius of the sun is about 390,000 miles. So the radius between the sun and Earth multiplied by 2 is 390,000 x 2. And then multiplied by 3 because of the spherical shape of the sun is 390,000 x 3 = 1.1 million miles.\nSo if the earth had the mass of the sun, the radius would be the mean radius of the sun divided by the mass of the sun. And then multiplied by the mass of the earth. That's 390,000/4.6 is 86,000, which means 86,000 times 6.37 (which is the radius of the earth) is 555,800 miles, about 3x10^10 meters.\nYou'll notice that 93 million miles isn't an integer number. So the earth and the sun both move in a small circle around each other. When they are an integer number apart, they come to a stop relative to each other and then start to orbit again. (I think that's the right explanation for why it isn't an integer number).\nSun, Earth, Comet, Planets, Earth 2 and the Moon all spin around the Sun. How did they spin around the same spot at the same rate in the beginning and why have their speeds and orbits and rotation increased. Please explain in my elementary terms. Thank you.\nWhat keeps a spinning top spinning? Gravity. The sun (and our solar system) were spinning. We don't know exactly how fast it was spinning, but it was spinning enough for the planets to form. As the planets formed, they also had angular momentum, so they were spinning too.\nThe earth also has some angular momentum. Even though it spins, if you took a stick and held it horizontally, it would point directly north. This is because the earth has a solid core. The axis of rotation in this case"

        "output": "What is the difference betwean interpreted compiled and JIT-ed programming language, can you also tell me some benefits of each type of language?\nCan you give me at least 3 examples from each of these categories of programming languages?\nA programming language is like a tool, it doesn't have an inherent meaning, it is only an instrument to express what the programmer \"thinks\". The programmer says \"use Python\" when really he says \"build a program with this tool\". In a sense, a language \"is\" its execution, so there is no difference between interpreted and compiled.\nIt is worthwhile to make some distinctions though:\na) The language you choose may not affect how fast your program runs, it may \"only\" affect how easy or hard it is to implement and how flexible your application is. Choosing the right language is a matter of convenience.\nb) The language choice may determine how your program looks. If your code is all strings, it will look like a bunch of strings, if it is all numbers, it will look like a bunch of numbers. If it is all a very structured syntax, it will look like a very structured object oriented program..\nc) The language choice may determine whether you need to use a compiler to compile your code into an executable or not.\nd) The language choice may determine whether your code can be optimized automatically by a compiler optimizer (which will be done if you do c) above)\ne) The language choice may determine whether your code can be shared easily by many people (which increases the overall knowledge of programmers, and increases overall productivity)\nf) The language choice may determine whether your code can be executed in the cloud.\ng) The language choice may determine whether your code has an easy to use debugger\nh) The language choice may determine whether your code has a good set of libraries/API for easy use.\nIt is important not to think that your language or API has inherent meaning, or that it is superior by virtue of the fact that you use it. Choosing a programming language is a practical, pragmatic decision. It is a tradeoff between many factors, most of which are not known when the decision is made. Each one of us has to \"make up our minds\" (with some influence of others) on which factors are the most important to one's particular choice (the choice changes as we gain further experience). We can only say \"the language I think is the \"right\" one has X features\" . All programming language features are worthless if one doesn't understand how to program!\nThere's a reason why \"program\" is spelled \"program\" and isn't \"proggram\". Every action is meaningless and empty, as is every thought in a mind made of neurons. In a mind that is the product of its culture, it means something, even if only to be a means and not an end.\nLanguage is an abstraction which lets us express a concept in a way we understand it. If one is trying to convey a concept or action in their mind, which is in a \"mind made of neurons\", they will probably find themselves using words they've learned, which will be a kind of artificial language which will not be their \"mother's tongue\". Which is to say, it will not be the thing they are trying to convey or the thing they are thinking. We create other languages which are abstractions from the reality. A child speaks as he learns from a language that is \"mother tongue\", but when he understands the nuance of what his mother said, he will create the same nuance in his own speech. A speaker of one language can't understand another unless he himself has been taught that language. Which is to say, as long as he doesn't understand the abstractions, he won't understand the nuance.\nThe purpose of a programming language is to create abstractions that provide a way that computers can understand our own language. Programmers express their code in a way which is as close to the reality or abstraction of our mind as they can. Programmers \"speak the language of machines\", or that is, the code in a programming language which the compiler can understand. Of course, it also must be readable by humans, or it wouldn't be of much use. We \"speak the same language\" to a certain respect with programs we write to accomplish certain tasks. The same is true for all languages, but a programming language is much closer than most.\nCompilers are tools that translate one language into the language of the computer we use. A programmer may use several languages, but may use only one, depending on the task. C++ for an application with a single purpose. Javascript for a website with a single purpose. Python for an application with a single purpose. Java for an application with a"

The creature had this special ability, called Poison Heal (which I think you also mentioned) and it's ability was said to have restored Nuzleaf's life on several occasions when it was at low health. Also, it said: An unidentified effect reduces damage taken by Nuzleaf if it has poisoned itself. Nuzleaf's status is shown on its tail's tip. What that status means, though, no one knows yet. That is, if any trainer ever notices this and doesn't think it's a regular Nuzleaf with the ability, rather than what it really is.

This code demonstrates how to write a simple quote in Markdown. A backmark is a string between a single quote and a double quote. A number can be entered on it's own or after a number to indicate multiplication. It's very simple and easy to use. In Markdown, it is possible to use double quote and single quote without escaping. You can find it in Notepad++ or on Mac OSX with TextMate. A backticks is used around the single or double quotation marks in text. Use it to display the text in a quote. A backtick is represented by its ASCII code, which is 96. The backticks ( or the quotation or quote marks are what you use to show your text in quotations ( ). The backticks, or low line, are used in programming, so you can enter strings for the computer to run. An opening double quote is preceded with an escape sequence and a back-tick.

If you wanted to walk all the way around the world, you'd end up doing more like 29,238 miles, because of the curvature of the earth at your home. So, if you wanted to do it as quickly as possible, you'd end up walking an average of 5 km/h, or about 3 mph.

        "output": "Pretend to be a business professional. Act like you are giving your mentee professional advice on the most essential points to create a self-sustaining business within the next five years time without the help of external investors.\nIt’s about teaching young entrepreneurs the basic steps of their business.\nYou will be able to help your mentee identify and grow the critical parts of their business, but will let them make the decisions themselves. The first part of step is, of course, getting a mentee, whom you will try to work with in advance to help them grow a great new business idea.\nYou should be prepared to spend a couple of hours per week mentoring your mentee but the time required will vary.\nThe only true way to see if your idea is viable or even if there is a market for your idea is to test it. Testing is not as easy — and definitely isn’t as cheap — as throwing dollars at prototyping, however, the results are much more valuable.\nNo successful business comes off the shelf. The only way to create a successful business is to fail at some ideas, to try new ideas, to test the market, to pivot and to refine. All of this — failure, pivoting, testing, and finally success — must happen in a safe environment but one which makes failing cheap and learning not too costly. The most important lesson a business mentor can teach a mentee is that failure is just a learning curve.\nThe mentor should be mentoring at the correct level for the mentee. The mentee should have the correct level of experience and should probably be at the same or later stage of their business than the mentee. If you are giving advice to entrepreneurs who are just getting started — if you are the “Big Brothers” or “Big Sisters” — then a mentor-mentee relationship is probably not what you want to be doing. The reason for this is that entrepreneurs who are just getting started need a lot of help and may not have the experience or business know-how to make the most of the information that they could receive from a mentor.\nThat doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t use an entrepreneurial mentor at this stage of your business. You should! But it does mean that you need to look at mentoring more as training and not as a mentoring relationship — you should be looking at the mentoring relationship more as guided tutoring. There are a number of ways for you to do this, but the best place to start is with an entrepreneurial training program from your local SBA (Small Business Administration) office.\nThere are a number of local SBA offices that run entrepreneurial training programs. Many of the training programs are geared for entrepreneurs who are just starting their own business and who aren’t as experienced as you may be.\nThat doesn’t mean that you can’t find good mentoring from local SBA training programs. Most local SBA offices use the SCORE program as a training mechanism for entrepreneurs. SCORE — Service Corp of Retired Executives — has been mentoring young entrepreneurs for many years. It is a very good program that has some top notch mentors who can work with you through the stages of your business.\nIn addition, many local SBA training programs also work very closely with other business development organizations and training organizations to ensure that entrepreneurs are getting the training they need to get their businesses off the ground.\nAll you have to do to find out about the training resources in your local SBA office is to contact your local SBA office and ask them about the local training programs they run. You will want to ask them if they take on mentors and if so, what types of mentors they are looking for to work with the entrepreneurs they are training.\nMany local SBA offices have developed strong working relationships with local training and business resource organizations that are helpful in creating and developing a mentor network for local businesses.\nOnce you find out who these organizations are, you can start to look for mentoring opportunities as these organizations are the best place to find the most experienced entrepreneurial mentors who are looking for some entrepreneurs to work with. If you are a young entrepreneur who has already started your own business, you still need some help to make your business successful. That’s where SCORE and local SBA offices can help you. Both types of offices have lots of potential mentors for you to work with — mentors with years of experience who have worked with both new and experienced entrepreneurs.\nSo where do you look for these mentors?\nLocal SBA offices\nBusiness resource organizations\nEntrepreneurial associations\nStartup"

What law states I must return to money (not say pay taxes ) to someone for some reason ?\nYes, I said it before, but it is even more true now. We are in a Constitutional crisis. And when I say that, I mean this. The Constitution says that we are a federal republic, and that means that the states are the ultimate source of authority. But we have been living far from this ideal for some time now, if ever. The Constitution does not say that the states are equal and have “fair” representation in the government of the whole union. It is written that the population, the number of houses, and the land area of each state would decide its “representation” in Congress. But that does not mean fair representation. It means that if you are one house (a single person or family), then you have equal representation within your state, but the actual number of people in that state makes it up in a lot of ways. As such, if your state is not populous, then your voice doesn’t count. You can literally be outvoted by one vote per person in another more populous state in some instances. So the actual situation is NOT even close to “equal fair and balanced”. That means the states, in fact, are not equal, and the Constitution only made it seem like they are. So we are a federal republic, with each state having unequal representation under the Constitution. And one way you can tell is that the House of Reps has been out of commission for over 90 years now. We use a legislating system, but the House of Reps isn’t supposed to have this much power. Yet, we use it in the same amount and effect that the Senate has, which the Constitution says will be the upper house. So when we hear people say Congress, they mean the Senate, and as a result (because they can’t use the HOR) they have ignored the Constitution and have made themselves a lot more powerful than the HOR should have. And this powergrab is not the only time they have done this to. Another example is the way the Fed Reserve board was created (the board itself was not the Fed. Reserve. Board., but it had authority over its creation and it is the board that regulates the Fed Reserve itself). The Constitution says that the legislative branch can make rules governing the executive branch when that branch was created by Congress (not the legislative branches). But they have overstepped their authority, and that is how we got the Fed Reserve instead of the government having regulation and having the banks be a part of it. And when you look back on the history of it, you see that the Fed Reserve was created specifically to avoid having banks be regulated by Congress and having it be in the government and have accountability to the people. And look at it now, the banks have no accountability to the people, but they are still one of the most powerful entities of our society with no oversight. They literally stole from the peoples money, and this is a form of treason as far as I am concerned. So, if I understand correctly, the House of Reps is out of commission for a very good reason. They have overstepped their authority numerous times since the Constitution was written and this has a lot to do with the problems we have today, and we have gotten into things much worse in the name of “progress”.\nWhich, according to Article I, Section VII, Clause II, this is specifically NOT how you appoint justices to the court. It goes like this. Congress can only confirm the appointment of justices if the people vote for the president (who may or may not be the same person who appoints the justices). But the people voting for the president is the only way to “confirm” the appointment of justices, which does not require an act of Congress.\n“In the case of vacancies in the office of the President, the Vice President shall be President, and shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint, vice presidents.”\nNow, this has only happened, once (although it was proposed twice). But the justices are NOT the president. They do have the power to veto an act of Congress (and override a veto) which is why they have the power to decide if laws are unconstitutional or not. But they do not have the power to appoint themselves or each other. Nor are they “equal” to the president, they are his employees.\nWell, this has been a long and short discussion… Let’s see.\nWhat is in question here is that the act in question here IS an act of Congress, even"

And my friend doesn’t have very strong views about the literary merit of either. I’m not going to argue myself silly about grammar or style (I’ll leave that to professional grammarians and suchlike), but a few observations.\n1. This is a short story. That is, it has a storyline, characters, conflict, and a conclusion which is the end of the story. It has no plot, as far as I can tell, but then there isn’t much plot to a biography, either, although it has some.\n2. The story is very short, 7 paragraphs, 3-4 sentences a paragraph, so it can be more of a sketch of a story than a full narrative. I like to say that it could be a flash fiction piece as well.\n3. The writer’s style is very different to her daughter’s style. Her sentences are long and flowery – full of words and phrases not easily understood by students (or possibly teachers). So the mother was very intelligent… or she was very long winded, take your pick, with her daughter.\n4. I don’t agree with one review I read. They suggested that the story was unfinished, with the mother still “lurking” in the narrator’s head. I don’t believe that her mother is in the story at all. Maybe the daughter has been inspired by the way her mother thought and behaved, but she has been inspired by her life, not by what is in her “mind”.\nOf course, that’s my opinion. But then, I’m the author of this post.\nAuthor abPosted on October 23, 2018 October 25, 2018 Categories books, english conversation, literature, writing17 Comments on Reading a short story\nAs I mentioned before, in the last three years of my teaching life, I did a “workshop” with people who had English as a foreign language. It was a wonderful time, and I’ll post about this soon. For the time being, I thought, I’d talk about one of the authors I used to introduce them to poetry.\nMelissa Balmain is a poet who started publishing in the 1980’s. She came from a family which was quite affluent, however, one of her parents was an alcoholic and so she never had the sort of luxuries her peers enjoyed, or the sort of upbringing they had. After school, before she went to college, she got a job at a petrol station – and that’s how she first met the man who later became her first husband.\nMelissa Balmain\nShe married at 18, and her husband’s family lived in England. So they moved there, and Balmain got involved with the University of London. When she found herself pregnant, she had to move back to New Zealand, where she wrote a book about her first year of marriage, The Hut. This was published in 1996 and went on to become a movie starring Kate Winslet. This was followed up by another book, Honeymoon in London, also about her life in England. Again, this made it to the big screen when Kate Winslet reprised the role of Balmain’s daughter. Another memoir was published in 1999, and her last book is a novel which was published in 2003.\nBalmain describes her book as being a memoir of a first year “married, and mostly pregnant, in the first years of marriage to husband, the Englishman, who is to become her soul mate.”\nHer writing is quite good. She has a vivid imagination, and her writing is very descriptive. Although the subject matter is sometimes quite sad, she never really reveals the extent of the emotional pain she was experiencing. I did find reading it difficult at times, though. A lot of her recollections are based on her husband being an absent character. In her third book, a novel, he has re-entered her world as a major part"

This week we will address the problems and challenges facing a business. The textbook uses the example of Sheri's Restaurant for your case study. Read the following scenario: Sheri's Restaurant Sheri, an avid supporter of the local high school sports scene, has recently taken over operations of her family's favorite sports bar and restaurant. Sports fans from all over the city flock to this neighborhood establishment, which serves a varied menu ranging from steak to seafood. Sheri is trying to balance the business of cooking food with the business of selling food. Sometimes her two worlds collide, which has created certain challenges in her restaurant. She hopes to retain her loyal fan base as well as attract new customers and, most importantly, keep her customers satisfied. In doing so, she hopes to be a successful entrepreneur and make a profit. This scenario will be used as a case study throughout this business unit. Next week, you will be able to test your understanding of the case study as you review the next reading and complete the next assignment. Complete the following in your learning journal (150 words minimum). Do the following: Think about what you learned in business class so far and how you can apply those lessons to Sheri's Restaurant. Why do you think some restaurants may experience problems or challenges such as Sheri's? Are there other problems or challenges that you can foresee at Sheri's Restaurant? (List at least two problems and challenges and explain why you think this can happen.) What business ethical principles must Sheri follow in order to be successful? (List at least two ethical principles.) What business and ethical principles must Sheri follow in order to achieve success? Remember to list specific principles followed in the reading, and explain your reasoning regarding possible challenges at the restaurant. Then, explain why you think the two ideas can go together. What can you learn from your explanation? You have a problem, how do you fix it? Next, review the concepts of this chapter and review your responses to the Journal and Question challenges for the week. You will see two assignments in this topic. Next, read the scenario of Sheri's Restaurant in Chapter 5 of the textbook and answer the following two questions. Next, read The Making of a Fashion Designer in Chapter 10 of the textbook and answer the following two questions: What does the ethical principle of stewardship mean? Why do you think this principle is important? How would this ethical principle help Ethel as she makes the decisions that will help her business go \"from rags to riches\"? How do you feel about the ethical decision to hire unqualified workers until the funds are available? Is this decision moral or ethical? If the decision is moral, discuss. If the decision is not moral, discuss the consequences and explain how you feel about them. What do you think they should do? What would your solution be? Would this be an ethical decision? Would this be a moral decision? Why? In this article, Sullivan discusses the need for people to have more ethical knowledge and the impact it makes. Complete the following in your learning journal (150 words minimum): You recently found out about three different cases in which business ethics were involved: a hospital director, a vice president of an international company, and a school superintendent. Read the following: Cases in Business Ethics [1] How would you analyze these three cases? Which business ethical principles would you discuss with them? Would anything change if this was your business? Would you have made different decisions? Are their any differences? If so, what are they? Which would you change if you could? Next, read the three different case studies in Chapter 5 of the textbook along with the Sullivan article from The Wired: Business Ethics. Next, complete the following in your learning journal (150 words minimum) (1) List at least five questions that you did not know about ethics. (2) Give answers to your questions in your own words, as if you were explaining this to someone else. (3) Write a summary of the reading for the journal and explain how this summary is relevant to what you do in your business on a daily basis. 1/ This is the first question and should be between 150-250 words.

        "output": "What are F-centers in crystallography ? How are they created and what consequences do they have on the overall appearance of crystal ?\n1.What are F-centers in crystallography ? How are they created and what consequences do they have on the overall appearance of crystal ? The F-center is created by a vacancy that results from either radiation or thermal decomposition of the crystal. As the vacancy is formed, the electrons move outwards from the center to fill in the vacancy. When the crystal cools, the outward moving electrons re-enter the vacancy, thereby creating a new defect, usually a non-stoichiometric complex defect, and at the same time forming positively charged ions around the vacancy. Thus, all F-centers are created by the formation of vacancies. The most common reason for the formation of vacancies in crystals is radiation which is usually in the form of alpha-, beta-, or gamma-particles. These radiation particles act on the large scale in the crystal and thus on a molecular scale. The resulting electron clouds are displaced and, with the help of thermal energy, the vacancy is formed as a result of two or three electrons moving to the next outer shell at the molecular level and one electron from the original shell moving into the vacancy, leaving the space occupied in the next outer shell. The resulting charge is that of two positive ions surrounding the vacancy and a space where one electron is found. The nature of the charged ions is usually ionic which is the case for most of the known materials, but could involve some polyatomic cations if they are present in the crystal. The space between these charged ions is called the interstitial space as the charged ions are placed in the molecular space surrounding the vacancy. These interstitial ions are in a similar state to the ionic lattice but a more accurate description is 'a defective lattice' or 'defective solvent'. As a result, the free electron cloud is disordered and is termed the ' F-cloud '. This F-cloud could be the cause of fluorescence, phosphorescence or radioactivity, depending on the chemical composition of the crystal. The F-cloud does not only cause the formation of the charged centre, but also causes the production of many defects and other impurities such as vacancies, dislocations and planar dislocations. Defects are formed only when the vacancy is formed and any defect will result in a higher dislocation potential and lesser charge on the surface of the material. However, these defects have low concentrations and usually are non-stoichiometric defects. 2.What is the optical and spectroscopic signatures of these centers ? Since vacancies inhibit or stop the motion around the vacancy, therefore, the vacancies cause the material to lose some vibration energy. This decreases the optical activity of the material in some cases, or increases it in other cases. The degree to which optical activity is diminished or enhanced depends on the number and the position of the vacancy in relation to the optical active centers which is explained further below. Moreover, the optical activity and the spectroscopic are related to the presence of the free electron cloud. This free cloud inhibits the mobility of the electrons. Since this 'F-cloud' is in constant motion, its motion causes the atoms of the crystal to vibrate and as a consequence, the vibrational energy of the system increases. However, since the atoms are constrained from their full motion by the F-cloud, their motion decreases and the vibrational energy decreases. Therefore, F-centers cause both a decrease in optical activity and a decrease in vibrational frequency. The optical activity of a crystal is related to the number of electronic states associated with the electronic configuration of the orbiting atoms and the vibrational frequency is directly related to the number of states in the vibrational motions of the atoms. Thus the amount of optical activity depends on the number of electronic states and the number of vibrational states and thus the degree of vibrational entropy. As the vibrational entropy increases, the optical activity of the crystal decreases as the vibrational states of the atoms are filled. The decrease in optical activity and the decrease in vibrational entropy as a result of the presence of vacancies is related to the decrease in the radius of the ionic cloud and thus, causes the F-center to absorb more light than its neighbour.\nSince the negative centres are charge-free and are in constant motion, the negative charges constantly move around these centres due to the charge difference and the resultant radiation of electric field waves around these charges."

        "output": "Explain why landlords can be considered superior to their tenants. In order to explain the reasons why landlords can be considered superior to their tenants, one must first begin by identifying four essential factors which must be present for this to be considered. Once this has been done, it can be explained that these factors do indeed exist when looking at the landlord tenant relationship. In order to establish the superiority of landlords over their tenants, the necessary aspects must be identified. As long as the conditions are present, the status of landlord over his or her tenant will be upheld. The four factors include that the landlord must own the property that the tenant is leasing, the landlord must have the right to exclude the tenant at any given time, the landlord must be able to...\n...Landlords and tenants: Do they deserve each other? In the early eighteenth century, the word landlord was considered to be more favorable than the word rentier or usurer . However it was no longer of good repute during the industrial revolution because the factory system meant that capital was put to work, enabling economic prosperity and increasing urbanization. As a result, landlords were seen as greedy and selfish. (Albino Garcia and Vesla Weaver) The landlord, in a certain sense, is an entrepreneur; an intermediary that brings together people in need of housing and the resource that fulfills that need. He/she does so on the basis of a risk analysis – which property will be leased to whom and for which payment. In contrast, the tenant is the person who receives housing services from the landlord and pays in the form of rent. The basic transaction is that a landlord provides housing to a tenant in exchange for money. The landlord thus, is the one who bears the risk and does the dirty work of sorting out and mediating problems encountered in the leasing of their residential housing units. While he/she may be seen as a hero in the end, he/she has to deal with a lot of problems that ultimately land him/her at the bottom of a “who-to-blame” list. The tenant is just happy to have somewhere to call his/her own in a society where not everyone has the chance to own a...\n...LANDLORDS AND TENANTS Do Landlord and Tenants Deserve Each Other? It is common knowledge that the landlord and tenant relationship is an essential part of everyday living. Many individuals are in this type of situation, even if it is not apparent to them. Landlords and tenants are in this type of relationship for very different reasons. Some people are landlords in order to make extra money; others are landlords in order to accommodate others who could not afford to buy a house. Tenants on the other hand, are in the relationship by circumstance. Some are renting due to the fact they cannot afford to purchase the house they are living. The circumstances that people are in can lead to either a positive or negative interaction between landlord and tenant. According to Bouskila-Hurwitz and Eyal (2005), it is “the study of interactions between agents under asymmetric information when one agent has superior knowledge” (p.1002). The parties may not have superior knowledge, however, the situation may force the tenant to learn from the landlord. Some of the interactions between the landlord and tenant may include problems arising from the agreement (Bouskila-Hurwitz and Eyal, 2005). It is not uncommon to have some form of disagreement between landlords and tenants. One of these disagreement may be due to the fact...\nFashion Magazine Essay\nChat Essay"

        "output": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?  I have used an iPhone with 3G and I have recently switched to a 4S with 4G to see if there will be any improvements in quality.  The download speed hasn't changed but the upload speed has become worse.  There have been other improvements too such as better coverage.  This is fantastic.\n> The iPhone has a built in modem.  Have you heard of anything which improves this builtin modem?  I'm not really sure whether they provide any service.  I would have thought it would have been included so that Apple could upgrade the modem at some point.\n> I have also seen a new 4G LTE USB modem called LTE Mobile LITE ( http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/mobileinternet/celluar/products/lte-mobile-lite/) which has 2 antennas so that it can provide 4G LTE service.  This will also allow for faster cellular broadband.  I believe that there is also a 3G version for areas where 4G isn't operable.  This might be good for some people if they want to enjoy a faster mobile broadband but unfortunately 4G coverage isn't as good as you might expect it to be.  There is no 4G option yet for the 4S.  I believe that the next iPhone may have a 4G option which will also make use of the latest LTE network standard which is not compatible with the USB 4G LTE modems such as the LTE Mobile LITE.  In order to use the modem, the phone would have to be jailbroken and then use a tool called \"Open LTE\" which was recently released by OpenRevs which makes use of the iPhone 4S's modem which can then provide 4G LTE service.  One of the disadvantages of this method is that the modem is not compatible with 4G LTE because of compatibility requirements.  The same can be applied to the new USB modems such as the Verizon MiFi 4510 L TE which has 2 antennae to provide 4G LTE service but is not compatible with the iPod touch which could make use of the USB modem to provide high speed mobile broadband.  It would be very interesting though if OpenRev's new tool which enables a jailbroken iPhone 4S to provide 4G LTE service could then use the USB USB modem.  Imagine what would be possible.  Unfortunately, 4G LTE service is a little slow.  It may be faster in some cases, but it isn't as fast for some users.  The biggest disadvantages are the coverage and speed.  In certain areas, the coverage might not exist for certain providers such as Verizon and will require an AT&T 3G network.  In other areas, it is slow due to high usage in the particular area meaning that it may be difficult to provide 4G LTE service due to high usage such as in offices and warehouses.  A big plus is that you should get high speeds while indoors.  This will be really good for when you want to download a large file or play online video games.  If you use a Verizon USB 4G LTE modem like the Verizon MiFi 4510 LTE, you will find that it will operate using Verizon's 3G 4G LTE network, which means that you can get full service in areas where they have 4G coverage even though the service is only 10Mbps. The other positive aspect is that the device is fully compatible with Verizon's high speed 3G network, so you can use the USB modem just like a mobile broadband card without any problems what so ever.  The biggest advantage is that it is a lot more cost effective.  This is great.  If you have been considering buying a mobile broadband card for your laptop, but don't have a lot of money then you should consider using the USB modem as long as you have a good connection to download large files.  If you are a gamer, you might find that you play a lot better because of fast speeds for online games.  I think you'll find that it will be very useful.  For people who use an Internet connected device, it is definitely the cheapest option.\n> Imagine if you were travelling around the world and were able to visit hotspots for free Wi-Fi and use the USB modem to get high speeds.  That certainly"

        "output": "Help me get a job in the government in which I’ll have major bargaining power and will be able to pay back all that debt that I owe (including interest – not in a year, not in five – but right now), even if that job pays far less than what my undergrad gave me.\nIn other words, Obama’s 12.5% tax on incomes above $250,000, which he’s been fighting tooth and nail, should be seen (and used) not as a means of helping the middle class, but as an important form of loan forgiveness – something that the current crop of lawmakers haven’t been remotely willing to do.\nBecause, unlike the federal government, which does have money (well, not yet).\nThere’s only so much the government can do, because our system of credit is based on private enterprise, not government-owned institutions. I don’t want to put more of a hurt on the US tax-payer to pay off my student loans because it’s simply too much debt for them to take on … which takes me back to my original argument!\nFortunately, my own student debt (which has accrued at a rate of 9.5%) is not nearly as large as yours, and I don’t own my house!\nSo I can’t really sympathize with this argument that Obama is trying to make!\nBut I totally (and I emphasize this!) understand why law schools are doing this. They’re the business school with the most prestige and they need to get their money somehow. The market is not there and they have to be proactive in doing what they can to get their money. It’s the same mentality that led to the credit crunch, but who am I to say such a thing.\nAs I have tried to argue (and you may have heard in an earlier blog entry), law schools exist primarily to serve the needs of private industry, not the needs of society (I’m looking at you, Fordham). We should have stopped them when they tried this trick. Now I fear that the trick will prove much more lasting in its effects.\nIn any event, I agree with you that we should be taking a much more critical look at what law schools teach, how they teach it, and what effect that has on the legal profession.\nThe answer’s obvious. The money the public spends on public colleges has a much lower rate of return than the amount public colleges cost. There is no such thing a free lunch.\nBut let’s do the math, assuming an average classroom of 25 first years and they stay for 4 years, that’s $75,000 per classroom, per year (ignoring a possible 5th year, which adds the cost of a clinical program). Now, law professors are expensive, but they don’t teach all those courses. Add the cost of administration (law schools have been on an administrative arms race with one another), and the costs just escalate.\nWith 6,000 or so law schools that’s about a billion dollars in public funds (I’m assuming the entire cost of 25 classrooms was paid out of public funds; I know of some schools that have some private and some public costs). Now, let’s say, conservatively, that the average publicly funded law school has 40 faculty members on average (which, believe me, is a pretty low number). That’s another $8 million per school just on their payrolls. Add in their benefits and office space and you’ve hit another 7 figures.\nAnd let’s say conservatively that each law professor earns, on average $125,000 per year. That’s an additional $800,000 per school.\nNow, in the private market that sort of costs is easily passed on to law students. After all, we all know that businesses are efficient machines that, in their quest for profit, find better ways of getting stuff done. If the same law schools were just out to make a profit, we’d be looking at annual tuition on the order of $250,000 per student per year (if not more). With such a low rate of return, no one would be willing to attend law school but, I’m sorry, that’s the market.\nBut because the government subsidizes their inefficient business approach, it becomes very difficult for them to simply cut salaries and benefits in order to maintain revenue streams sufficient to pay the faculty and rent.

One example: \"doors\". \"d\" comes before \"o\", \"o\" comes before \"r\", and \"r\" comes before \"s\".\nThis is an easy problem to solve with a quick check for words (and the dictionary doesn't have to do this).\nI don't get the \"Give me 5 words\" part - can't you do this yourself - and the requirement for words in alphabetical (or whatever order) - can't you just give your answer in alphabetical order?\n\"Give me\" means you can't use these words anywhere to solve the problem. You have to find them yourself; you can't see them. It's more of a challenge than a normal solution (where you are given the answer).\nHere's an idea, in code form. I'm using ruby, not javascript.\nfor key in words.keys do\nfor letter in key\nif alphabet.include? letter\nfor n in 1...26\nletter = letter.chr(n + 65)\nuntil array_of_letters.include? letter\nif alphabet.include? letter # array_of_letters hasn't been built yet\nwords[letter].reverse # puts the words in reverse alphabetical order\nPut the code in a method, and make it private; then call an instance method from another object (or function). That way, you don't have to worry about \"Give me 8 words\".\nThe code is correct. All you have to do is pass the word to your function, and it will give you the word back in the same order, but backward.\nBut you have to be careful to call the function before calling the dictionary.\nMy code is too complex, just to check for a word in a list of 5 words.\nIf I had the 8 words, then sure, I could do it.\nYou might be thinking about this too complexly.\nJust give me the list and I'll reverse it (alphabetically) and I'll be done?\nI have a simple solution that is \"better\".\n\"Give me 8 words\". That's the hard part.\nI would think the best way to do this would be to make the key a random word and the value of that key would be a dictionary of words, not the dictionary name itself. That would allow you to search this dictionary of words, which should be built on the first search. (ie: You can search for any random words, as long as the word was originally in the dictionary, then it will be searched for each of the words) Each word is then put back into the dictionary in reverse alphabetical order. That should be it.\nCan a program be better if it does the hard work for you (even if you have to write a few dozen lines of code in the process)?"

And what about the Pogroms in Poland in the early years of the 20th c?\nBesides this, he will try to help the two parties hammer out a workable and peaceful plan for coexistence. He knows how to handle people, and he will be able to work with the leaders from both Israel and Palestine.\nIt is no accident that Obama chose the above man to lead his peacemaking team.\nI believe he is a Zionist. I think he will succeed in convincing the Palestinians of the need for peace, since he has made peace with the Arabs and Muslims around the world. He understands the fear of the Palestinians and the desperation to have their own state. But more importantly, he has come to believe in this cause. It is part of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and he now believes it.\nWith his help, a compromise will be found that will satisfy both parties, and the current stalemate will be ended. In the future, we will look back on the Balfour Declaration and the years 1897 to 1948 as the years of transition between one time and another. Our hope is that Obama will help us to establish a final agreement, a lasting and just solution that will allow Israel to coexist with a Palestinian state.\nSo, for now, we can only wait and hope. Our fate, the fate of the Jewish people, is in the hands of Mr. Obama.\nWill our history repeat itself? Will 1948 become 1918 in the new world order? The Jews have waited for 60 years of peace and prosperity in Israel under the auspices of the UN. Have we been duped? Or will Obama's words become action? Only time will tell.\nThe following is a photo that I took of an abandoned home in my neighborhood. It is in the process of being re-built. All I could think about was that it had been 17 years, 10 months and 24 days since I was last here. And that it was still an occupied territoy. I thought of all the friends and family that I knew and loved and who are still missing, and thought of all the people that I had lived alongside for so long who are living in refugee cites around the Palestinian territories, and how I know they are dreaming about what they left behind. I thought about the history behind this place and why a peace settlement could not be reached between the two sides, and why a people who had given so much in their service to America's wars over the three and a half decades since they \"fled\" were somehow still not accepted. I knew the reason that they would not be accepted: the fear of the right of return of the people of Lebanon, of the same fear of the right of return of the Palestinians, that the fear of the right of return of the indigenous Native Americans, Blacks and Hispanics in America, and the fear of the right of return, and fear of integration, of the people of Africa. That fear in not of the people that were wronged, and it will never lead us toward peace.\nI also knew that this fear was born out of ignorance, lack of education, and lack of communication between cultures. I wanted to take pictures to show the world, the good people of this country, the ignorant people of this country, the blind followers of this country, the people who are afraid of losing something that they never really had, that people of the world are people of the world, the same color, religion, language, the same dreams, the same lives lived under oppression, the same hopes for the future. There will never be peace and unity until there is communication. But when we as peole of the world speak with our wallets, not with our fear, but with our understanding that the way of the world is always change, that we can not prevent it, that we can not go back to the way of things that are not anymore, we create the change that we say we want.\nThis is a photo that I took right after I arrived in Jerusalem this afternoon.

My wife also needs the phone to read me the news in Spanish for the 6.00 am radio show.\nTelling a friend about it\nWow: that sounds like a really tough schedule, but you seem to have a lot of energy.

This schedule gives me an opportunity to participate in the community, do fun things, and spend time with family. It is really important for me to manage my time and energy intelligently so that I do not miss out on the most important things.\nFor this to work well, my employer needs to know that I work a lot on open source projects after hours. Without support from a manager and coworkers, I would not be able to do this.\nI think that what you have achieved with your open source contributions in your limited free time is quite incredible. Do you see a trade-off between being a family man and being an open source contributor?\nI think I could do a bit “much” by using my personal time more productively, but I am happy to do this for now. I think it is important to have a life outside of open source. Many open source contributors focus too much on open source and spend too little time outside open source.\nI have some things that I have been working on for more than 10 years that might never see completion. However, working on these things has shaped me, and I have learned a lot.\nFor me, it is more important to see something completed than to work on something forever.\nDo you have any advice on how to balance between being a family man and being an open source contributor?\nTry to work closely with the people you work with. They will appreciate your help and be understanding when you need to prioritise your family. Be honest and direct in your communications. Do not just make excuses, take the blame and tell people you do what you do because of your family commitments. Also, I believe that you will be happier if you pursue your passions rather than spending your life working hard for a pay"

        "output": "Please implement the Timsort algorithm on Lean 4 and explain your code\n\nComment: I'll be adding TimSort at some point, but my focus for now has been on Leansort. Please be patient :)\n\nComment: And as I wrote in my answer, Lean 4 supports a *lot* more C++  library code than just boost. So I guess it's good enough to say: use Lean 3 and Lean 4 for the same problem at the same time to show that it's a reasonable choice. :)\n\nAnswer: Another argument against the C++ library option is that it is more cumbersome than using the standard library, and hence requires more effort to incorporate into one's code.\n\nA further advantage of your option is that you can add a little utility software to your project to run over your source code with C++  and generate object code for it, that way, you can produce a buildable code base that doesn't rely on the C++ library support and is less bug-prone (you can't get that with Boost).\n\nMore or less at the same time, you could start working on Leansort and the resulting C++  code base will be relatively bug-free and less tedious to work with than all the boost libraries, and therefore easier to work with. I'll be using a similar code structure in a project of mine, the Boost C++  support just doesn't make things worth it since I am working on an embedded system. Also, with the C++  code base, I can leverage the standard library and have a much more versatile code base that I can also incorporate into other non-embedded system projects, for example.\n\nAnswer: The problem with the C++ solution is that your code will have to depend on it (you'll have to write \\begin{code}\nboost::container<Foo>\n\\end{code} instead of just \\begin{code}\nFooContainer)\n\\end{code}\n\nAlso, you'd have to download the Boost code and compile it into your project, which requires a bit of work.\n\n\\strong{The advantage of your C++ options is that you won't have to do anything to change the source code if someone downloads and modifies the boost source.}\n\nThe other advantage is that boost is not a great solution if you're using a version of the C++ standard other than 2011.\n\n\\strong{Here is a little information about how you might accomplish your version of Leansort in C++:}\n\n\\begin{code}\ntemplate<typename T, typename Comparator = std::less<T>>\nclass LeanSort{\npublic:\n    LeanSort();\n    bool sort(T const& x);\n    T& operator[];\n    void output();\n    constexpr LeanSort();\n    template <class... Args> inline LeanSort(Args...);\n    friends:\n        template <class T> friend class LeanSort<T, Comparator>;\n};\n\\end{code}\n\n(I haven't implemented the `friend` stuff yet.)\n\n\\begin{code}\ntemplate <class T, typename Comparator = std::less<T>>\nclass LeanSort<T, Comparator>::operator[]{\npublic:\n    friend class LeanSort<T,Comparator>;\n    T& operator[];\n    template <class U>\n    friend class LeanSort<U,Comparator>;\n};\n\\end{code}\n\n`T` is a value type, so its `operator[]` should be friend-able.\n\n\\begin{code}\ntemplate <class T, typename Comparator = std::less<T>>\nclass LeanSort<T, Comparator>::sort(T const& key)\n{\n    // You can use `boost::container`, if you're sure boost::container is implemented in your version of C++\n    LeanSort<T,Comparator> temp;\n    // The comparator should take the Key and the current Node value as params\n    temp.operator[](key) <= temp.operator[](current_node.key);\n\n    // Do some things\n}\n\\end{code}\n\n\\strong{Note:} It might be a better idea to make the `operator[]` method a function that takes the parameter by reference. You can do that in C++11 [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cplusplus_syntax_ref_parameter_reference.xhtml), but it requires a bit of work (although once it's implemented, you"

        "output": "Which of the following elbows are the most wet?\nA. A kilogram of feathers\n2) Coach Malibu\nD - The cross-section of air, and the cross-section of feather are both the same – 1 mm². If there were 20,000,000,000 birdies, and if each feather weighed about 0.06 grams, then the feathers would weigh 1,200 tons. But the feathers are very lightweight (about half an ounce each) so this weighs less than 1% of air. The webbing of the wing is made of about 25% elastic fibers.\n3) C - The skin is a thin layer of feathers – about half an inch, that prevents bacteria, dirt, flies, or germs from getting into the body. There are other important layers of feathers which help to keep birds warm and dry, but we'll get into those later.\n4) B - Each time a bird flaps its wings, there are some that hit the skin and don’t get through. Birds have special structures to help deal with this, one of which is the ruffle of contour feathers found on both the upper and lower wing coverts. The contour feathers give the skin something to grab and slide up or down depending on the wing position. This helps to reduce the number of feathers that stick to the skin, and helps to keep them from sticking so firmly to the skin that the bird won’t be able to get the wing up in the air again.\n5) C - Birds have a large number of feathers surrounding the breast area, which serves the purpose of keeping a bird from losing heat. In very cold climates, some birds use what are called counter-current heat exchange systems to keep a bird warm. These systems are actually blood vessels that are located inside certain feathers. As the bird moves, these feathers move and rub against other feathers, allowing some hot blood to circulate from the warmest parts of the body. In the same manner, cooler blood travels to the cooler regions of the bird.\n6) A - In wet climates, the downy feathers can quickly lose heat when wet, and therefore make a bird colder than the temperature of the surrounding air. This results in a bird growing a second set of feathers: one for the outdoors and one for the indoors. This is not necessary in dry habitat, because the feathers in these cold climates stay dry and are not a problem.\n7) D - The feathers of some species look very rough, and the scales look like rough sandpaper or velcro. This type of feather helps the bird in water by reducing drag when swimming, and in aiding to propulsion when flying.\n8) E - The feathers can range in color from light to dark gray, to black, brown, or white. The majority of feathers are a muted shade of brown, but this has more to do with the pigment in the feathers, not with the color of the feather. The down feathers, however, are generally white, but can also range from nearly white to nearly black.\n9) C - Feathers are not like those of mammals because they don't have layers underneath the scale-less portion of the feather (or flight feather). The feather is comprised of a quill that has small hook-like barbs that are formed at the tip of each quill, called vanes. The barbs all point in the same direction, or towards the quill core. Since flight feathers also have muscles attached near the quill core, when the muscles contract, the feather is blown forward. The air flowing over the feather then becomes turbulent and causes air to flow over or under the feather in a vortical manner. This vortical movement then causes a net upward force and gives the bird its “lift.”\n10) A - We talked about flight feathers earlier, and since they are comprised of many, many barbs pointing towards the quill core of the feather, the vanes don’t overlap. We also talked about contour feathers which are similar to flight feathers, because it’s the barbs on the contour feathers that the skin grabs hold of. Since other vanes can cover them, the contour feathers don’t need to be as long (i.e., in flight).\n11) A - Many feathers are not used for flight. Most of the tail, head, back, breast, and rump feathers are not in the"

I have had the pleasure of being in Brazil for one of the biggest fights of my career. Unfortunately, due to the lack of facilities, I was forced to cancel my plans of attending the event. It was very frustrating to have my fans, most of which were not able to attend the fight, wait for hours to see me, but my fans weren't the only ones left waiting at the UFC facility. As it turns out, so to were the referees and the judges.\n[Mar 30, 2017] The UFC and MMA should have been shut down long ago because of the inherent dangers involved in this sport.\n\"... Mixed martial arts (MMA) has been around since 1993 and is based on the premise that the greatest champions are those who possess a well-rounded blend of various fighting styles. MMA is not a sport for the faint of heart and is very different from the WWE. MMA is extremely deadly because in most cases you have to fight off the ground, which means not only is your opponent's ability to fight off of their back challenged, but also you risk being taken off of yours into an unfavourable or vulnerable position. ...\"\n\"... In most cases MMA involves a high degree of competition. In some cases an undisclosed level of contact is allowed, but more often than not, all strikes are to the head. The head is a very fragile weapon to have and so the idea of a fighter \"getting his bell rung\" is no laughing matter at all. In the case of a bad knockout you can be assured that your eyes will roll into your sinuses, which means you will be at an extreme disadvantage, at best, and be completely blind at worst. ...\"\n\"... Concussions, along with contusions and other facial injuries are very common in MMA. The list of boxers who had their careers ended as a result of head injuries is far too long to list. The UFC should have long since banned head strikes, especially since a knockout can easily turn fatal. ...\"\n\"... For many MMA fighters, there is a price to pay both in terms of dollars earned and physical health for their participation in the sport. As many as one in three boxers retires with some type of brain injury. Even at the lowest levels many fighters face serious health costs because of injuries sustained in fights. Many of these young, fit fighters are not insured and will be expected to pay for medical and rehabilitation costs. Often they have not the resources and, as a consequence, face significant challenges. ...\"\nJamie Kiser March 29, 2017 at 10:45am\nUFC Fight Night went ahead tonight with the event being held in the city of Curitiba in the Brazilian state of Parana. In fact, the UFC is in Brazil right now for four straight events over three weeks as it hosts a series of Fight Night cards. After tonight the next event will be the big one called UFC 217: Bisping vs St-Pierre, which will take place on Nov. 4, 2017 at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\nIn addition to the aforementioned UFC 217, the next UFC events will be (UFC 216: Woodley vs Thompson 2) on Oct. 28, 2017 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada, followed by UFC Fight Night: Moraes vs Moicano on Nov. 25, 2017 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York City.\nWith UFC 217 being just six weeks away, the organization is going all out trying to cash in on its popularity. Curitiba is filled to capacity tonight with about six thousand people making the trip south to attend UFC Fight Night. There are no doubt plenty of other hardcore fans who are unable to attend the event, and these"

What does this email seem to be asking?\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Why should the word choice be informal in tone?\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWe can deduce that\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Sally is emailing her female co-worker or another female that Sally considers to be a friend.\n\\item Sally is emailing Jen because Sally wants to ask a favor.\n\\item Sally is emailing Jen about the meeting tomorrow which suggests that Sally is also a co-worker of Jen.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAll of these would make sense based on using informal tone as an email written to a friend or co-worker but using a formal tone as an email written to a person that is not a friend or co-worker, which would likely use the company's formal titles as an email would usually have both the co-worker's and company's name.\n\nThus, we can deduct that Sally is likely writing to Jen out of friendship, not business.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item What does this email seem to be asking?\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWe can deduce that Jen is going to speak at the meeting and Sally wishes for her to perform well as the audience might be male.\nWe can, therefore, deduce that the email is asking Jen to ask for approval for a specific sales number before the meeting and that Sally does not trust Jen to perform well at the meeting as Sally believes that Jen cannot deliver the requested sales.\n\nHence, from the tone, I deduced that the email was asking Jen to get approval for a sales number so when speaking in front of male co-workers and so that she could make her job easier afterwards.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Why should the word choice be informal in tone?\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nBecause Jen wouldn't have felt offended as Jen didn't believe that Sally was upsetting her.\n\nAlso, Sally had no reason to be formal as they were not being professional in this email.\n\nThey were asking for approval of a sales number and it was only a meeting amongst workers, so there would have been no reason for Sally to be using a formal sentence structure to ask Jen, who is a close friend of Sally's, for a favor.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n5. Why should the word choice be informal in tone?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nBecause I believe that\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item I believe that Sally would have been upset if she had used formal terms or a formal style.\n\\item When you’re writing informally in a work-related situation, it’s important to know when to maintain a work-appropriate tone. In this case, Sally is asking for a favor of which she expects to be done.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI believe that Sally was in a panic as she had left the sales number to Jen as if Jen had failed then it would look as if Sally was not properly managing her department. She therefore didn’t want Jen’s job to suffer as a result of her failure.\n\nShe therefore wanted Jen to get approval whilst getting a favor from Jen so she could blame Jen, who failed to perform the requested sales, and not Sally, her manager, who didn’t ask her subordinates to do so.\n\nThe email, therefore, seems to read something like this:\n\nWhen"

Debugging on a device can be... well... kinda tricky.\n\nComment: Do it like this, Main, main, UIM, UI, UIM.UI.  UIM is a simple class that just has a method, UIM is a simple user interface.    UIM has a method that returns an object.    UI returns an object.    UIM and UI must both implement a single method, returning their object, which will be displayed in the main JFrame.\n\nComment: Don't start with Main.  As a basic coding rule, you should always start new classes with \"class\" and end with \".class\" (though you shouldn't worry about it now)\n\nComment: Don't use any getters or setters.  Use a constructor to set your data.\n\nComment: Where are your UIM methods?  I.e: 1. String getName(){ return name; } 2. Getter setter to change the text. 3. String getText() to get the String text to send. 4. void textToSend(String s){ toSend = s; } 5. void sendToUIM(String s){ myUIM.setText(s); }\n\nComment: I am just about to finish the UIM class\n\nAnswer: Your textToSend method is not in the UIM class.  You only have to do 2 things to get it working:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Make sure it's the only toString method in that class.\n\\item Make sure it returns a String.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nHere is corrected code:\n\n\\begin{code}\n/**\n * The main component of the user interface.\n */\npublic class UIM extends JFrame implements ActionListener {\n\nprivate ArrayList<Object> content = new ArrayList<Object>();\n/**\n *\n */\npublic UIM() {\n    setBounds(20, 20, 330, 250);\n    setFocusable(true);\n    setFocusTraversable(true);\n    setResizable(false);\n    setTitle(\"My User Interface\");\n    setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n    getContentPane().add(content);\n\n    // The \"contentPane\" is simply a label\n    // that will display the UIM text\n    contentPane = content;\n\n    // Add an ActionListener to the UIM, and this\n    // will be the ActionListener of the UIM.

I am writing to request a day off on [date]. I have already taken care of my work responsibilities for that day and will be available to answer any questions or concerns you may have. \nThank you for your time, \n[Your name]\n\nAnswer: You can write and send an email, asking if one of your colleagues can cover for you. It would look something like this:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nDear [colleague name], I am writing to ask if you can cover my shift tomorrow, the 2nd of August. [If you were the first to respond and to agree, simply remove this sentence – ed] I hope you are well and have had a nice weekend. See you in the office. Kind regards, Jane Doe.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnother option is: Dear [colleague name], I write to you as you are the closest available work colleague. I am taking a day off on [date] so the next person on the rota list is [colleague name] tomorrow. If it is not possible for them to cover my shift, could you please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you. Your response will be much appreciated. Kind regards, Jane Doe.\n\nAnswer: As a manager, let me clarify what I think could be your intent and tell you how I would deal with the situation on an individual basis.\n\nYou mean that you asked several colleagues if they can cover your shift for you by answering one work e-mail, yes? And you are hoping that someone will respond at all and then cover so you can enjoy your vacation day? I would appreciate that as well, and would respond positively.\n\nUnless you are the only nurse in the office (not likely), you should have the right to a personal day off. Nobody would ask you to cover other person's shift at the same time. If it really matters to you to take a day off and someone is willing to cover for you on the same day, then you both have a win. I would not hold it against anyone who does not want to take my shift to cover me. I would take it as a sign of mutual respect: You are working in the office as well. So if I am the only one on shift, what will you do? Nothing. If I am working with several colleagues, each of us is covering his or her shift on the same day. I will have the time off, and you are also off that day as well.\n\nSo how do I deal with employees who claim they need to take a vacation day on the same day I want one (as a manager)? Well, depending on your company culture, I may respect their feelings, or I might feel that the only fair thing to do is to assign that day to someone else. The decision will vary from company to company, so each manager will have a unique view of the situation. I may feel that I am entitled to have a one-on-one conversation with that person and convince him or her to change the vacation day. Or I may not care and feel that I am giving that person an undeserved personal vacation day.\n\nIf your employers would prefer to do only one way and that cannot work for you, consider whether some sort of an alternative work arrangement will better suit your needs.\n\nAnswer: The polite thing to do would be to wait until the end of the day when you had coverage for the day off and see if any one of the people you had asked would actually take your shift.\n\nHowever, if you were planning your vacation (and you didn't have to get someone to cover for you) it would have been smarter to take the full vacation day instead.\n\nThe simple thing to do would be to ask the person who is covering for you to cover someone else's shift for a day.\n\nHowever, it might be that the people who covered for you were more reliable and trusted than your other colleagues.  And then you run into the problem with asking your superiors if you can take another person's shift for two reasons:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item They may be suspicious that you are just trying to get someone to cover for you so that you can enjoy your personal day.\n\\item You have less cover to go to if there is a problem when you are out.\n\\end{itemize}"

To write a social media post about the call for collaboration on a crowdsourcing project in a persuasive way, you should create engaging content that provides information about the project as well as an enticing invitation or call to action to participate. You should also use keywords in order to help potential volunteers find the post.\nCreating an online marketplace is a great idea if you want to establish credibility in your niche and earn additional revenue, but it’s also a huge undertaking and requires a lot of work, so you may end up with no return on your investment. On the other hand, if you can create a unique marketplace that’s in high demand, then you will most likely be able to succeed. The steps in this article will help you understand what’s involved in creating your own marketplace, and give you suggestions on how to be successful.\nEfficiency can make or break a startup. Too many startups sacrifice quality for speed, and it shows when they miss deadlines, make mistakes during rollouts, and put out products under-polished and incomplete. On the other hand, many startups become so focused on the clock that quality suffers.\nIn the last several decades, we’ve observed a significant shift in the way employers screen potential hires, and in particular, an increase in the popularity of behavioral assessment.\nI often hear the opinion from entrepreneurs that they should hire only a few great people and never delegate. But I think that you should actually hire many great people, and teach them what to do. There are very few people who can run a company and do everything – many people can run the company and teach people on their team what to do.\nYou’re ready to turn your social media presence into a cash cow, but before you do, there are a few things you should know about social selling. For starters, 92 percent of B2B marketers use social media to promote their businesses, and 98 percent of B2B marketers agree the future of sales is social.\nIn the first half of 2016, U.S. retail companies employed an aggregate of about 225,000 robots – an approximately 13 to 15 percentage point increase over the same period the previous year. And the increase is expected to continue. According to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, a consultancy, that could be as much as a 400 percent annual increase by as early as 2030.\nWhether you’re building a new website or just revamping an existing site, it’s important you have the right website security strategies in place. After all, there’s no point building a secure website if you’re not keeping it secure. Fortunately, there are very straightforward ways to implement the necessary practices, many of which can help with search engine optimization as well, making your website even more worthwhile.\nIn a previous article published in The Huffington Post and in Venture Beat, I’ve discussed how to go about designing and prototyping a mobile website. This article aims to showcase how to build an entire mobile app using free platforms, how to get it to work with native apps, and how to start monetizing a mobile app in the long run.\nIn the business world, you can take an entrepreneurial approach to almost any industry. From farming to the fashion industry, you can make a profit by offering new services and developing novel products to capture a fresh market that’s never been tapped before. For instance, some folks buy small plots of land to grow their own vegetables, and others take an innovative approach to clothing choices to avoid buying from stores that use traditional fabrics.\nWhat do you need to think about if you are building a startup? You think what? You never start? It’s too late? You have the right thing going? You are just starting now? You had it and you let it go away? You are going to get there some day? You have to do this first before that? What the heck are you even thinking?\nMoving your business from the home office to the real world can be an exciting time. However, it’s also a complex, potentially risky process. If you get off track, you could end up with a big hole in your revenue and possibly even a bad reputation if you lose track of what’s causing your problems.\nIf your business relies on customers coming through your"

Here are some examples: This is the worst poem I have ever read! It was horrible! The most terrible poem I have ever read! There are several different ways of writing a poem. You can write about something very specific and try to make it as descriptive as possible or you can write\n20 about something very abstract, like love, and use it as a means of communicating yourself emotionally. A poem often makes connections between things or states of being that our everyday speech doesn t. Therefore, you usually need to look at the words and the ideas behind the words to make the connections. You can also use metaphors to help your audience connect to your ideas. I want to tell you a secret. My life isn t like everyone s around me I have a dream. I don t want to be average. That s why my dad said that we should just take a year off. He wanted us to save up money for college before he got a job when we returned. He knew that I needed a break. This was a huge sacrifice for my parents, not just monetarily, but also by not being where they wanted to be. They couldn t have done this if they hadn t given their lives to God. Because of this, I think I am an open and honest person. When I say I m doing okay, there is no hidden pain. I believe by trusting and putting my faith in God, He will take care of me. This doesn t mean that I don t get discouraged or sad. I am totally normal in that sense. I really liked this quote from John Wooden s book Wooden on Leadership: A lot more goes into being a good leader than being able to run a company. People are much more complex than that. It s about being able to recognize that complexity and to handle it, and to handle it in a way that makes people better people. In order to be a good leader, I believe you have to be trustworthy. You have to be someone that people will turn to when things are bad and they want someone to comfort them. You cannot be someone that people like all of the time. When someone has a problem, you cannot always have the perfect answer. Sometimes that takes away from a people s ability to learn for themselves. That means sometimes you can be selfish like you can be unreasonably demanding upon others. You have to be able to accept situations that are uncomfortable for you. You have to be willing to put in a great deal of hard work if you are going to run a company. Most importantly, you have to be someone people trust. Otherwise, they will not want to give it to you. I believe this quote really relates to my leadership style when it comes to my peers. I like to help people whenever they need it. The moment they need something they know that they can come to me and that I will make it better. The reason why I do this is because it makes me feel good. If I help someone, I feel a sense of accomplishment. I feel like it is going to make them better people. That is probably why I want to be a teacher. I believe it goes back to the time I realized my parents could do anything they set their minds to. I wanted to be exactly like them when I grew up, with a passion for education. If my students say they are struggling and really cannot find a way to fix the assignment on their own, they come to me. If they can t figure out a complex problem, they can ask me. If they have a hard time understanding a concept in class, they can come to me for help. I always try to be there for them, so I can learn with them every chance I get. I always do my best to make them feel comfortable and\n21 to make them know they are capable of doing whatever they set their minds to. You will notice that there have been very few references to sports in my leadership qualities. This was extremely intentional. I believe a large majority of schools, when you look around you notice that schools revolve around their athletic and football teams. They only talk about those things because those things make the most money for them and these are the things that will give you the most attention from the outside world. While I do believe academics should be a main focus, I do not believe they should be the center core of a school. I believe there should be many different ways a student can find what they enjoy and where they excel. I think there should be many different ways where they could get involved. I think if someone wants to do something there should be an opportunity, and I am not saying that if they want to do something with sports, there won t"

This means that you no longer requires to spend money to hire a server and pay for electricity bills and maintenance. You simply take your code to Google, they deploy it and take care of everything.

It will be an intergrated platform consisting of a social networking site, email and instant messaging facilities. The Mesh is very similar to what i have mentioned above in the way it is going to be a super site which is a mixture of social networking features and an email and IM systems . Some other features i was able to gather are as following\nEmail address which can be given to anyone in the system.\nSocial Network with people you know\nProfile creation and management\nChatting via IM or Facebook Chat\nCalendar facilities which allows anyone you add to your list to see your calendar and post any event.\nThere are other features that i don’t know for sure but i assume that this service will be like that\nHope there will be more features added\nHave a look at the video and let me know what you think of the service.\nA new way to communicate with people\nWell, one of the major problems we encounter in online is the communication with people. Most of the websites or blogs are run by individuals and they want to communicate their views and expectations, so as to get some response. The thing is that if you are not using some social networking sites like My Space and Facebook, you may not reach out to the people which you like to discuss with . The solution to this problem lies in creating your own website. But, a lot of people have their own ideas about making money on the internet and they are so busy working that they lack the time and means to have their own website. To make matters worst, most of the hosting companies charge a lot for their services and therefore even if you own a website and make enough money, it will not be able to pay the hosting bills.\nAfter talking to some people about it, we have all realized that there is a need for a site or a platform which can ease and facilitate our communication with people over the internet. Thus, a new idea is being formulated to address this issue. The idea is just to create a platform which can be used to interact with different people over the internet. The platform will basically contain some features such as\nBlogging with full control over your blog\nPictures posting with full control\nBandwidth Control for individual users\nAll the features are in draft state and it is being developed to be open source and very easy to install. This means that even if you are not a programmer, you will just be"

        "output": "You are given an algorithm or a search query about coding. Look for a code snippet related to the search query.\n\nPython loop (for loop)\n\nA for loop iterates through a list or a range of numbers. For example, to print the values from 1 to 10, you would write:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfor n in range(10):\n    print(n)\n\\end{code}\n\nWhen the loop has iterated through the values, it starts again at the first value. Example:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfor n in range(10):\n    print(n)\nfor n in range(10):\n    print(n)\nfor n in range(10):\n    print(n)\nfor n in range(10):\n    print(n)\n\\end{code}\n\nResult: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nWhile loop (while loop)\n\nA while loop checks if a condition is fulfilled. When it’s fulfilled, the body is executed. When it’s not fulfilled, the condition is checked again. The while loop will keep checking the condition until the condition becomes false. Example:\n\n\\begin{code}\nwhile n != 10:\n    n += 1\nprint(n)\nwhile n != 10:\n    n += 1\nprint(n)\nwhile n != 10:\n    n += 1\nprint(n)\nwhile n != 10:\n    n += 1\nprint(n)\n\\end{code}\n\nResult:\n\n\\begin{code}\n2\n3\n4\n...\n9\n\\end{code}\n\nA simple “if” conditional is very short. When n == 10, it will jump back to the first statement and continue to print 2. Example:\n\n\\begin{code}\nif n == 10:\n    print(10)\nelse:\n    n += 1\n    print(n)\n\\end{code}\n\nResult:\n\n\\begin{code}\n3\n11\n12\n13\n...\n20\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: *”You can learn from the code of other people.”* Well, if you’re looking for code, *[Python](https://python.org/)* is the place for that.\n\nComment: Your question has been edited and you're no longer a Python newb.\n\nComment: So this site is a great place to find coding help (and general programming help) but it's not a great place to ask how to learn Python. If you have general programming questions, they'll get answered here. If you want help with learning (or using) Python, take a course (on EdX, Coursera, Codeschool, or code.org) or hire a tutor (on Tutor or Kahn). If you're in elementary school, talk with your parents and teachers for help. I found EdX and Codeschool and have watched their free videos, but I'm not using their courses.\n\nComment: Please use comments to clarify your question, and do not update your information (edits) into your question. Just write more things in *comments*. What's wrong? Is not what you asked for? Why?\n\nComment: @Ev.Ly: “But I could not understand how to write a code in python“ – and now you've updated the question with code, so if you're not at the point of understanding python syntax and how you put it together with `print` to write a simple function, you're far along!\n\nComment: I removed the unnecessary parts of the question, i also edited the question to something simpler that works. Thank you everyone for your help!\n\nComment: For the record, you don't *always* need `print` or `.write` to output something in Python. You *can* use any number of methods to do that. For example, you could `sys.stdout.write()` which basically calls `print` and writes it to `sys.stdout`. Or if you want to only output the values of the elements, then a simple `for` loop plus print statement is enough.\n\nComment:"

Your help is needed in automating code generation to speed up the development process.\n\npython function to determine whether a number is prime. it requires the user type out the numbers to be tested.  example = test_a_number(42) will return 0 for the first test but 5 for the second as 42 will be divisble by 5 but not by 2 or 2*25 . the function prints out a 0 or a 1 after the test is complete.\n\nAnswer: I'd write functions to test each number from `num` up to `max`.  Call that function when the input is less than `num` else when it is in the `num..max` range.  There is no reason to write each test explicitly.  One could just do a loop in a function:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef test_num(num, result = 1):\n    return result == 0\n    while num <= max:\n        result = test_num(num+1)  # 1 => not a prime, 0 =>prime\n\n        if result == 0:\n            return False\n        if result == 1:\n            result = test_num(num+2)  # 1 => not prime, 0 => prime\n        if result == 1:\n            return True\n\\end{code}\n\nYou could write more specialized functions."

Select the colors or colors codes that you want to use. For example, you may want to use the colors in the first photo as your color palette. When you’re ready, drag them from the photo into your text.\nHere’s our 4-step guide to give you the best chance of writing a presentation that actually works, and that actually sticks in the audience’s mind. Let’s get your idea approved. There is one thing that most people find really, really hard about design reviews: how do you make sure that more than one person gets involved. You can’t simply ask someone if they like your design, you need to actually get agreement in real-time, on the spot. The problem, however, is that design reviews are about opinions, which vary greatly between individuals. You can have one person say that they hate something, while another person thinks it’s awesome. How do you get people to agree when the only solution before this was simply trying it again with two or more people?\nYou’ll likely hear the same three opinions in any single design review, which makes it really hard to decide what to do with your designs. The people in your design reviews are likely experienced designers, who tend to have strong opinions. So how do you create that consensus, or better yet, actually get a majority of your design reviewers to agree? Get feedback to become more productive (and less stressed) in your work flow. Get feedback from trusted friends and colleagues.\nThis is the tried-and-true strategy for solving your toughest creative or presentation problems. When you’re at your wits end, it’s always worth asking a trusted colleague for their opinion. They can also help you figure out what to focus on in the first place. Make sure you share your designs with them. If they need a little extra push, here’s why you should ask for feedback. Find outside feedback from a designer. Even if you don’t know many designers, a freelancer or designer-friend of a friend could be your secret weapon for design ideas and advice. This is where things get a little tricky. Many designers like to work in secret. For you, it means getting a free consultation. In exchange, you’ll likely need to share your designs with a little friend for your newest project.\nHere are 4 places you can find design consultants to help with your projects. 1. Freelancer and Guru. Here’s where you can find and hire freelancers that fit your needs, like a web designer, graphic designer etc. Be sure to ask for feedback or ideas in your project post or in the comment section of the freelancer’s profile. Don’t forget to give your freelancers feedback. 2. Upwork and Freelancer. Like Guru, these sites are marketplaces for freelancers, which means you can find and communicate more easily with designers from anywhere around the globe. 3. Twitter. You can search for hashtags like #designtips, #webdesign etc and ask designers about your feedback.\n#freelanchers, #screencaps, #feedback, #consultants, #tips Get infront of people with their attention focused on you. Your work can be seen by an unlimited number of people when your designs are showcased along with other top designers and artists work at Creative Market. When a design is popular, we’ll notify you and give you a chance to be featured on our front page. Your goal as a creative professional is to create content that gets noticed. A great way to get started is to create something for the community. You can choose from more than 1,000+ items from 30 categories in our marketplace. Your work could be featured and could lead to more customers.\nWe want your feedback to help improve our experience. This survey will open up a new window and will have a time limit.

Even if they're bought in varying amounts, the result is the same - you'll still pay the same sum of money.\n\nIn my opinion, the right answer would be that the student is encouraged to do calculations. The only thing they could do, however, would be to show you the sum of the prices on one of the pages.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{The total is $56.}\n\\end{blockquote}"

        "output": "Find sentences from reliable sources such as the Guardian or Forbes that contain the exact match for the given sentence or phrase. Also, mention the source of each sentence.\n\nThere are great options to collect texts from your daily experience, either by means of the web or by means of your own applications, the most used option is through the web. In our lab we use the Text Analytics Library (TAL)\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/Microsoft/tal}}. TAL is a collection of tools, among them the Tweet Analyzer allows to extract text from the social media (\\url{https://github.com/Microsoft/Twitter-Analytics}); it is based on the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)\\footnote{\\url{https://www.nltk.org/}} and it supports many popular social media services. The second most used option in our lab is to use custom applications. As a result of the first step, we will have a collection of sentences. These sentences have to be normalized to a common vector space format. The most used option in our lab is Semeval-2 Task 3:\n\\begin{quote}\n\\vspace{-6mm}\n\\begin{small}\n\\texttt{SENTIMENTS: SENT(2014-2015) TASK3 SUBTASKB: \\textbf{Sentiment Extraction on Multilingual Documents}}\n\\end{small}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\end{quote}\nIn this task, we were only allowed to use monolingual texts. Thus, we had to prepare texts in different languages. The main challenge of this subtask was related to the fact that the sentences were not of the same length and, thus, they had to be reformulated in a way that they all shared the same length and similarities. We can do some reformation, like removing some punctuations, in order to have all sentences with the same length and, consequently, the same vector space representation. The resulting sentences in the vector space should follow the distribution generated in the previous step. This means that sentences in similar language will be close to each other, while dissimilar languages will be separated by a wide gap.\n\nIn the following section, we explain the different steps, from the original text to the new reformulated sentence.\n\n\\subsection{Reformulation of Sentences}\n\\label{sec:reformulation}\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\begin{quote}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\begin{small}\n\\texttt{P1. The text extracted for our task is in the following language: French, Dutch and German. In this task, only monolingual documents are allowed.}\n\\vspace{-6mm}\n\\end{small}\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\\begin{quote}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\begin{small}\n\\texttt{P2. To deal with the problem of sentences with different lengths, }\n\\texttt{we may consider converting sentences to a common format.}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\end{small}\n\\end{quote}\n\nThe first subpoint of this paragraph refers to the sentence structure, in this case, the sentences have different lengths. The solution to this problem is to use text representations which support text summarization, in our case, the Sentence Blobs (SBs) as presented by the \\emph{TalkBank} project\\footnote{\\url{https://talkbank.org}}. An SB is a short text representation composed of the most frequent words. For more details, you can look at our paper \\cite{OConnor_Rodriguez-Munoz_Correia:TAL2017}. The second subpoint indicates that a problem of the sentences is their length. Usually, short sentences have lower values and longer sentences have high values (\\autoref{fig:vectors}), however, we need sentences in the same length.\n\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.99\\linewidth]{images/originals.pdf}\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\\caption{Original sentence vectors. This shows two different sentence vectors in the same sentence space. The sentence in Spanish is longer than the sentence in English but they are still placed close to each other. The first line shows the sentence in English. The second line shows the sentence in Spanish.

        "output": "Think of alternatives and paraphrases for the underlined word.\n\nwhat we have _expected_; what we hoped _experience_ would have _made us_\n_believe_.  I see now that I was wrong to _speak_ as though the man might have gone _out_ for a walk during the day.  It seems absurd to have _thought_(?) that he could, when he has not gone _out_ for three _months_(?)--the night before.  And in all that time, I never _asked_ him what it was he _did_, not even for _hours_.  But I could _wonder_--only I _don't_.\n\n11. A. Combine the fragments of sentences into clear sentences, beginning with capital letters.\n\n1. The man _had_ gone out as usual.  So I did not expect his coming at all.\n\n2. It was _so dark_, it was so dark.  I have often remarked that the moon is never quite dark.\n\n3. I _watched_ for him, and I waited long.  I knew the town was not more than a mile and a half from the house.\n\nII. Combine the fragments of sentences into clear sentences.\n\n1. They asked if he was home and the mother told _us_ he wasn't there, for she had called him up to see if he was sick.  I said no, he couldn't be sick, his voice wasn't sick.\n\n2. But in fifteen minutes the man came in.  He had been at the store for candy; but the store was a good way from home.\n\n3. The other ladies wanted to have a private talk with her; they sent the children out of the room and the man and I sat.\n\n4. We didn't speak at all; we couldn't have said if the man had ever been to Boston.  After a little she asked me in a very cold serious voice if I thought the man was sick.\n\n5. I said no; he was just as well as he always had been; he would be home at eleven; they had telephoned the doctor at eleven and told him the man was sick.\n\n1. The man went out as usual; then I noticed _he was_ absent and wondered.  There were two or three persons absent who would have been there if they had been on the street; they were all old friends whom you would have thought would have called to say they were on the street.  One or two were known to have been sick and others would always have come and asked if they were sick.  I was at work, and at first I didn't think anything of his absence; but it was so unexpected that it became _unusual_; for it was so unusual that a man didn't come home at ten o'clock.  Then to keep at work seemed very strange to me; it didn't _seem right_.\n\n2. So I began _to think_.  I know now that I have been mistaken; I wasn't quite so _wise_ as I thought I was--that is, I had _been_ wise; then I am _not_ wise.  They say one can never be wise, that is, one who is wise all of his life.  I think they think that's so; but they think that I and all of us who are wise, have been wise all of our lives--that we have been _wise_ from birth, but that no one _becomes_ wise.  I don't think that, I am _not_ wise.  I have never known until now, what it is to know.  I have always had a notion in my head; I thought _that_ was _knowledge_.  I _know_ now what it is to know.\n\n3. I _don't_ know, but I _do_ know that if I had known, that when the man went out ten o'clock, I would have known then something was wrong, for he never took his book away; but I didn't.  I think I _could_ know now, but I don't; for no one could know now, until there is something more to know, and then you know; and that man who used to be so wise--so very wise once, might be very wise now if he were in my place; but he isn't; for he is not in my place.\n\n12. Combine the fragments into logical connections.\n\n1. There is an end to everything but death and the dead.  Many men and women, many races of men and women, many peoples of men and women, have been"

I can edit my solution so that it's easier to read.\n\nComment: No, it looks clean. My problem is that we are not given the labels for the test data.\n\nComment: There's no test data because we already have enough data to learn from (which is the first line). In the end it's all the same. It's just that data_x_train is how you refer to the training data, and train_data is how you refer to the labeled data. For the test data, you simply use the original training data and test_data\n\nComment: I also see that there is no labeled data in the test_data part. Do you know how we can label the data so that the model knows what we want to predict?\n\nComment: The data_x_train is what the model will predict, and train_data is the label that will tell the model what to predict. You can't predict new things without giving it something to predict. Otherwise, it will just spit out random figures\n\nComment: I understand where your confusion is coming from. You can think of train_data as this: [['brand', 'color'], [label_train]] where label_train is the label.\n\nComment: Thank you so much, but could you provide me with a working solution for #12 and #13 please"

        "output": "Give examples of popular shows and movies in the genre.\n\nGenre: Crime TV Shows The genres can be split further into subgenres, depending on the characteristics that are the most emphasized by the art in the genre. In order to analyze which subgenres exist, a good method is to start with the characteristics of a specific type of art, and then go on to a more specific type of art. In the case of the crime genre, the general characteristics are: the plot revolves around crimes and criminals, the art is usually made to make the viewer feel afraid and disgusted of the criminals’ actions, and the art is usually shown in a documentary style. In order to get a more detailed understanding of different subgenres, the best method is to look for examples that fit the characteristics of the genre, and at the same time the examples should be different enough so that they can be separated into different subgenres. In the following example, a few of the most popular crime TV shows are analyzed and classified by genre and subgenre.\n\nExample: Crime TV Shows\n* Criminal Minds\n* Without A Trace\n* The Closer\n* CSI New York\n* CSI Miami\n* CSI Las Vegas\n* Law & Order\n* Law & Order SVU\n* Bones\n* Cold Case\n\nThe general genre of these TV shows is crime, where they all revolve around different types of serial killers and criminals and their intentions. They all show different ways that people can get hurt, how the police solve violent murders, and how the criminals solve the murders. Each of the TV shows are different in what they focus on. The main focus of Without a Trace is to find the criminals and then to get them to tell the whole story of how the crime was committed and to catch the criminals. The Closer is the opposite it focuses on the police solving the case and finding out the details about who the people are that committed the crimes. Some of the examples are about criminals and their stories while others are about their victims and what the last moments of their lives are like. Cold Case is about the details of one murder while Bones is about the details of a group of murders that happened during a specific period of time.\n\nFor example: Bones and Cold Case take place in past times, in the early 90s and in the 1960s respectively. They both use the real world as their backdrop of history. Without A Trace takes place in the present. For the most part, all of the shows focus on the victims of the crime and how they deal with what happened to them. They often have flashbacks to when the events happened in  Bones is also very realistic, since they use the actual bones in the actual crime scenes to solve the case. These are the most important characteristics of the shows, since they all focus on one specific type of crime and how people handle it when they occur.\n\nBones The Bones TV show is a very different type of crime story with a more realistic setting and approach to solve crimes. The case on the show revolve around people who are actually trying to catch criminals who are on the run in order to get them to tell their story and confess. They do not try to hide the fact that the story is a fictional story, but try to make it as realistic as possible. For a case to be solved, the team has to dig through all the details of the victim´s life, and learn all about them in order to solve the case. The team is also very different, they are all very different people and work best with their own abilities and specialties. The main focus of the entire show is to make people feel that they know about the character that was hurt and how he or she was in different life situation when that was killed. It wants the audience to really sympathize with the victims and feel bad for the way the victims were killed. There are a lot of violent crimes that are solved in this show and the main focus is to make the viewers know all about how the victim felt before being killed and to help the viewer put themselves in the victim´s shoes when the murder occurred.\n\nCasualty, an example from the medical drama genre:\n\nCasualty\n\nMedicine has always been a big part of TV dramas. It is one of the more easily accessible genres because so many people spend so much time around doctors while they are sick themselves. Another reason for the widespread use of medicine in TV dramas is that they can be shown in a lot of different ways. This means that doctors can be a lot of things in a TV drama, such as: the good doctor, the"

Now I need to modify that so that when you click that button, it replaces the content that is already on that page with the playlist data. I can't just add it in. It needs to be where I have it currently.\n\nI also have a PHP file on my server that just pulls a playlist ID from the database and saves it to a file. That file is what actually displays the data on the page with JavaScript.\n\nEDIT: I need the button to say \"Click to load this playlist\". I need to be able to click and that replaces all the text on it, which means the `href` should be there. This needs to be done with Javascript (probably jQuery) and the HTML and CSS are all set like that for display. I'm not too bothered about how it works.\n\nI need help with:\n\nA button I can use that just opens a link in a new tab. Right now, it is opening a link in the same tab.\n\nAn option to change the link so that it actually replaces the content it is on instead of opening a new one.\n\nComment: you can use jQuery toggle() function to display playlist on click\n\nAnswer: The solution:\n\n\\begin{code}\n\n<a onMouseOut=\"loadPlaylist()\" onMouseOver=\"this.className = 'playlist' active\" class=\"playlist\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/tracker/<playlistID>\"><!--link that opens in a new tab--></a>\n\nvar loadPlaylist = function(){\n\nvar el = document.getElementById(\"content-link\");\nif(el)\n{\nel.replaceChild(x,el.childNodes[0]);\n}\n\n};\n\\end{code}\n\nThe fiddle is also [here](https://jsfiddle.net/c694pv6r).\n\nThe answer is in the link given in the fiddle.

You can find materials online to download for free, such as the one developed by the California State University Fresno, Listening Comprehension Test, but you may choose not to give the test until after the activity is completed. A test at this point won’t help students understand the activity any better than they could. On the other hand, the test is a useful data gathering measure regarding how well students understand the instructions and the task, and for what purpose you chose the listening activity."

        "output": "Make a list of the most popular podcasts. If you need help with this step, start by looking at iTunes directory and reading the podcasts.\nThe process of listening of podcasts to listeners of their own podcasts via an application for iPod touch 3 and above. On devices not supporting the audio format Apple provides the programmatic interface libpod.\nThe development process of the Apple Store. When you release podcasts, they will be automatically indexed and then available for download in the main system of the Apple Store.\nIn fact, you can make a podcast with any application: even with iMovie. If you can read the text to the sound of your voice, with the help of Apple software create a podcast is possible. And of course the voice quality depends on your audio equipment. However, any podcast needs to be carefully and clearly enunciated in order not to lose audience.\nTo start, you need to make a list of topics. On each theme, you need to read a text. Once you have an outline, it will be much easier to record a voice podcast. In addition to the topic, read some quotes from the books, movies or famous historical characters. The main thing is to find something to read, which will inspire the audience.\nWhen you begin the preparation of material, it is strongly discouraged to record it from one source, without pausing the pause, to insert any links to the next source material. This will lead to the confusion of your audience. For example, to read an excerpt from the book and insert it after the pause the link to the Internet site, where you can read the book. Or vice versa — to read a paragraph on the link to a site that hosted the excerpts from the book.\nAnother important aspect of podcasting is the length of the podcast. Most podcasters recommend choosing a suitable length for a podcast that is 15-20 minutes. And if the podcast will exceed the maximum duration, then it should be divided into parts and then posted to iTunes. Also, it is strongly discouraged to podcasts, which is 1-2 hours and more: it will overload the resources, which will not meet the needs of your target audience.\nPreparing a voice podcast, remember that the quality of service and the quality of the sound should be the same as iTunes. In our case, we'll need high quality voice and sound. This can be done if a reliable microphone will be used.\nThe main rule of a sound recording is not to try to suppress noise, which is often present during the reading of the text. In order to solve some of the problems associated with the noise you can use anti-noise equipment.\nThe main purpose of the development of podcasts — to create a personal, unique and authoritative source of information. Try your best to read your own unique voice in your podcast. And as the voice podcast more entertaining than dry and boring reading of any material? When creating a voice podcast will be a lot more fun, the better your own podcast will listen to its listeners. With a good voice of the podcast will be a lot easier.\nIn the modern world, anyone who wants to get noticed and attracted the attention of the audience, needs to be in it in the first place. The main method of which is a podcast. This is a very simple process and takes very little time to create a voice podcast.\nIn recent years, with the rise of new technological devices, to be in first place has become much easier. Nowadays, with the help of a mobile phone you can create a podcast, which is no less in their content as an audiobook in iTunes. And since the most popular podcasts are about 20 minutes in length, and not longer than an hour, you can try your own voice to attract the attention of its listeners as a good writer."

Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?\n\nComment: The very best thing to do is to go your own way.  If the friend was paying for everything, I'd be inclined to just not call attention to problems that can be sorted out later (or even if they can't)  It always gets painful when I can't find a way to just keep quiet.\n\nComment: I think it may be helpful if you could explain what you find “negative”. Is he being rude or just not saying (or doing) what are in your mind the correct things in the right way at the right time. If the latter, what is the ideal form of discourse between 2 strangers on the road? If he is being rude, I would ask him, calmly, if there is something about the trip that is making him unhappy so that we can try to adjust our behaviour. It may be that he is just bored - a roady, or the wrong sort of roader for you.\n\nComment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it could make the problem worse.\n\nComment: This question is unlikely to be on-topic on this site. Questions about how to resolve the conflict are encouraged on [Code of Conduct] SE because that site's users have made a decision about what is considered important: https://codeofconduct.se\n\nComment: @user58697  I suggest your friend's negative vibes are a bit like an allergen.  It may be too late in the trip, and you have nothing to do with why they started.  If they are too strong to ignore, then it may be better to leave the place when others are present (friends, hotel, etc.) rather than create a scene (at least not until very late in the trip).\n\nAnswer: First of all, you're a week into a two week roadtrip; this should be enough time for you to decide if you want to continue the trip or not. If you decide that you do want to continue, then I suggest that you do that and do your best to ignore his negative vibes.\n\nIf you decide that you want to end the trip early, then you should approach him and tell him that. You shouldn't try to tell him the reason so that he feels back because that is irrelevant. Your reason is enough.\n\nIf this doesn't give you enough satisfaction, you will then have to choose between telling him his bad vibes are making you unhappy or waiting for a time when others are around and just leave. You decide the least amount of personal drama that will make you happy.\n\nAnswer: A few years ago I was travelling south through New Zealand. I was driving through Southland and after a day or so of no internet and no cell reception I was about to stop for the night.\n\nMy friend decided to text me when I was a day out from stopping. He then told me that he needed a ride home at the end of the trip.  That I couldn't make it because I was driving the car. (I had asked him the size of it and what he needed to transport several months before.)\n\nI told him I'd work it out after we stopped for the night.\n\nTurns out he's not going to stop in any of the places I have planned for us to stop and his response was to say"

But please, don't make that mistake.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\nA \"second\" in this context is usually interpreted as someone who came in second or, perhaps, in the semifinals of a tournament or contest or in the finals of a lower-tier, e.g. provincial, championship tournament.\n\nNot an actual second, i.e. runner-up.\n\nE.g., \"The Saskatchewan Huskies came in second at the University Cup.\"\n\nA \"second\" in this context does not usually refer to a runner-up, e.g. the first-string quarterback who did not get the job because the starter played well.\n\nIf a \"second\" is a runner-up, e.g. the third-place contestant of someone who came in first, that would be \"third.\"\n\nComment: What's the difference, though? A runner-up is just that, a runner-up, a second in the sense of second-best.\n\nComment: Runner-up can also be used in the sense of _second_, but the idiom is only used of third, fourth etc. _in the semifinals_.\n\nComment: That might be clearer.\n\nComment: \"A second\" in this context does not usually refer to a runner-up.\n\nComment: OK--but that's not what the OP asked. The OP asks what to call a _second_.\n\nComment: No. But my original comment was meant to respond to the post by [@RudolfBast](http://english.stackexchange.com/users/7201/rudolf-bast).\n\nAnswer: \"The runner-up at the Saskatchewan Huskies men’s hockey team\" is commonly used.\n\nI am not aware of this expression's origins.\n\nIt seems an extension of \"the runner-up\", as found in this sentence from the [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/runner-up):\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\strong{runner-up} [...] as an adjective [...] one that comes second \\em{a runner-up prize}\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: 'The second prize at the Saskatchewan Huskies men’s hockey team' will be used in the case when a 3rd place also comes.\n\nAnswer: I would describe them as runner up, the runner up."

With regard to this, I would suggest you to write one or two paragraphs of introduction as well as one or two paragraphs of explanation.\n\nThe first paragraph of your blog post should introduce the blog post to your readers.

To get you started, a few possibilities include the following:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item You can:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item start the task/project at a time that you are not very busy\n\\item start your task/project in a setting that you like to be in\n\\item start your task/project on a day or time of the week when you are in the right mood for it\n\\item break the task/project into small, do-able sections so that it isn't daunting or overwhelming You can:\n\\item give yourself positive thoughts (\"I can do this task or project\", etc.) when you're procrastinating\n\\item set a timer so you get yourself going right away\n\\item make yourself accountable to yourself\n\\item find an audience or somebody who will help you\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nBecause our lives are lived out in a number of different settings, at times some will be more conducive to the task/project that we have before us than others, and so it behooves us to make the extra effort to make sure that we are in that 'right\" setting when we're trying to do things.\n\nThere's also a general principle of behavioral psychology that says we'll do the things we do in the environments that we're in.\n\n\\strong{Conclusion}\n\nA big part of effective intervention techniques with regard to procrastination include setting the right types of expectations for the student (and parent) in terms of when, where, and how much will be done.\n\nIf I want my son to read every book that I'm about to make available to him, then we have to establish a place, time, and expectation that makes it most likely that he'll do that. \\strong{Note: In the end, the student should develop his or her own plan for reducing their habit of procrastination and be held accountable for this success.}\n\n\\strong{Resources and suggested reading}\n\nLawrence, C.

To do this, twelve young and fit men were put through a grueling 2-hour workout, including leg presses, shoulder presses, and crunches. At the end of this exhausting workout, each man was measured for the amount of calories that they burned. The conclusion: exercise can increase your metabolism, but only temporarily.

        "output": "A confirmation email should be written appropriately for the situation.\n\nA meeting has been scheduled, and the sender expects the other to review the slides. In general it's impolite to open a meeting, take a look, and make comments or suggestions when the meeting is already underway.\nIt is common to write the following email:\n\n```\n\"Hello,\n\nI would be happy to share the following slides. Please review them and let\n\nme know of questions about them [or what you would really like to do with the\nslides once they're created?]\"\n```\n\nNote that \"I would like to share\" or \"I would like to submit\" is less direct and more politically correct than \"I would like to propose\".\n\nOne should also be prepared with feedback for others and should not rely on others to give feedback for him.\nThe sender must explicitly ask the question regarding the proposal.\nThe sender must clearly state why he wants the proposal in the first place.\nThe sender must not be confused between feedbacks and suggestions. The proposal could be considered as a feedback/suggestion if the proposer does not clearly state his goal.\nThe proposer must also know when he has met the approval and when he has reached a conclusion. A conclusion is the process of reaching a decision. Once the proposer has reached a conclusion, he should proceed to the conclusion.\nThe proposer must be ready to accept changes to his proposals.\nThe proposer could send the proposals in more than one email to clarify his intent or to receive feedbacks from different members of the audience.\n\n#### Communication barriers in meetings\n\n* Time pressure: The goal is to reach a decision within a predetermined amount of time.\n* Group dynamics: The need for everyone's opinion to be heard.\n* Rationalization: Members try not to hurt other feelings and give a more rational answer than the initial response.\n* Confirmation bias: Members accept statements which confirm their initial beliefs rather than seeking out information that will challenge these beliefs.\n* Overconfidence: Members who are overconfident think that they know everything and they do not seek out new information.\n\n#### Meeting structure\n\n* Agenda: Allows meetings to begin and end on time.\n* Acknowledgement of pre-meeting work: Encourages members to review documents (if any) prior to the meeting.\n* Introductions: For members of the audience who do not know each other.\n* Approval of the Agenda: Enables members to check that the meeting is on the right track.\n* Rationale for the Decision: Helps the audience understand the decision and to justify the reasons for the decision.\n* Decision: Helps the audience to understand the decision. Clearly stating what was decided and when it was decided\n* Post-meeting notes: A summary of the decisions\n* Notes of meeting: All documentation produced during or after the meeting\n\n### Negotiation\n\nNegotiation is the process of achieving consensus between two or more parties by bargaining for mutually acceptable solutions. Negotiation is an important skill to master. In negotiation, the negotiators must take into consideration any type of information that may determine the final outcome of the negotiation. The final outcome of a negotiation must be clearly understood by the negotiators; otherwise, the negotiators will not be able to reach an agreement to determine the final outcome of the negotiation.\n\n#### Participant skills\n\nThe following skills are necessary to achieve negotiations:\n\n* Problem definition\n* The communication process of negotiation\n\nThrough the negotiation process negotiators are required to be able to evaluate information, to interpret information, and to reach decisions.\nIt is important for all participants in a negotiation to have good interpersonal skills. By doing this, the participants can effectively communicate within the negotiation. However, participants can overlook the non-negotiable issues that arise often in negotiation and can cause problems.\nNegotiators should take into account who their opponents are, where they are from, and their culture (i.e. customs, values, and beliefs). This information helps the negotiators to assess their opponents and decide their bargaining strategies, which may affect the negotiations.\n\n#### Meeting structure\n\n* Agenda: Ensures that information is not forgotten and the time is used efficiently and effectively.\n* Acknowledgement: Reminds participants of the reasons why they have assembled and provides an opportunity for any clarification.\n* Opening statement: The negotiators' explanation of the issues of concern as well"

        "instruction": "You need to write an email to negotiate your salary.",
        "output": "You need to write an email to negotiate your salary. There are no standard rules. Sometimes, companies prefer to pay you a good salary from the very beginning. Sometimes, they prefer to increase it from the very beginning. Therefore, the salary negotiation must depend on the company situation and not on your own needs.\nAsk for a better role. After working for weeks or months, you might see your real abilities and decide that you prefer to work in another branch of your company or even in another one. Thus, if you feel a certain dissatisfaction with the current position, raise your voice and ask a higher position in the company or a different one.\nComplaints. If the reasons for your dissatisfaction are related to the personal conflict with your colleagues or a specific problem you have with your boss, you should not hesitate to address your complaints towards the appropriate person. This would create a good image for you, but you should be careful with your arguments and not lose control of yourself.\nReveal your ideas to your boss. You might be the most qualified and experienced person, but it would be a shame if your boss and colleagues do not know your ideas and plans. It would be good if you could develop your ideas together with others and implement them from a manager’s point of view.\nShare your experience to others. Have other employees learned something from you? Be sure to share your knowledge and experience to your colleagues. They will appreciate it. It will make them feel more confident and your work will no longer be in vain.\nDo your best. Always do your best at work if you want to keep your job, you have to give it your best at all times.\nGet yourself noticed. When your boss or colleague is not paying particular attention to your work, do not give up! When you finish working on something – show it with pride – especially if you feel that you’ve done your best. Remember to get yourself noticed, as you will receive rewards and recognition every time you do a good job.\nBe creative. When the team is working on a project, everyone is involved and has an opinion on how the project should be completed and what ideas would be good to include within it. Be creative while working on a project and suggest your own ideas to complete it.\nAsk the others about their ideas. Your colleagues and boss might have some interesting ideas to implement – but if you don’t ask them for advice – then you might not get the opportunity to implement them.\nShare your ideas at a meeting. When a meeting takes place, everyone has an equal voice and chance to be heard. Sharing your ideas and knowledge is a great way to get the respect of your colleagues, and show them your expertise on a given matter.\nOffer the others help. We are not saying that you should always offer to help your colleagues – but when it is necessary to learn, do not be afraid to ask them for help. It is a good way to build a relationship of mutual trust with the others. If your colleagues get to know you, they will most likely find you useful on an ongoing basis.\nOffer the others help. There is no harm that when you have extra time in the free, you offer a helping hand to a colleague who has a lot of work to do. It will make their lives easier and it will motivate you.\nProactive behavior. Do not wait for questions or directions from your boss. Try and get ahead of the game, and work out what they need from you and how you can best help them with their own duties. They might have even more work to come – and have not yet been assigned to an employee who might be able to complete it and in turn, impress their boss.\nGive positive feedback to each other. When you have had success and you are very pleased with the work that has been accomplished, do not be afraid to give your colleagues constructive feedback. Not only will the positive feedback motivate the others, but you might learn something from them.\nHelp each other to organize daily routine. When you spend a considerable length of time with other colleagues, you will create a very special routine with them. One of the goals should be that everyone helps each other to organize their routine. It is not only about organizing each of their workdays – but also about the daily life. All other details you consider will help you to organize everything in the best way.\nHelp the others to develop their work routine. If you like the others and you cooperate with them quite well on a daily basis, you could also become a trainer for the other employees. You would help them to learn how to develop the work routine so as to have the most efficient working day possible.\nAsk the others about their concerns and problems. The"

As they progress through their academic career, they try new approaches, including the teaching of Mr. Herman (Dabney Coleman) whose main goal is to instill discipline in his students. Each boy in the group follows his \"own path\" and each faces danger as a result.\n\n\nThe Matrix (1999)\n\nDirected by Andy Wachowski\n\nPlot summary:\n\nThe Matrix was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Editing, and won Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.\nThe plot of the movie begins with a young woman, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) entering her apartment only to be confronted by agents of the Matrix. A sequence of action sequences ensues and ends with Neo (Keanu Reeves) stealing the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim). This action ends a 9-year long war between the Machines that enslaved Humans in a virtual reality world, and the Humans.\n\n\nIn the following, there is a brief explanation of the idea of Allegory of the Cave, by Plato, and how it relates to the plot of The Matrix.\n\nAllegory of the Cave is a part in Plato's work titled Republic, written about 380BCE. It deals with the concept of a cave, in which prisoners are attached to the walls and live in shadows that are the only realities they see. Since the prisoners cannot move out of the cave, the real world is outside of the cave; and the only way they can become aware of the truth is dying. A prisoner named Socrates is taken out of the cave; when he sees real things, he is astonished. As he moves in from the shadows toward the light, he comes to terms with the truth about reality.\n\n\nThe main character in The Matrix, Neo, is portrayed as a prisoner of a sort, as he struggles to understand reality when faced with an unfamiliar perception of reality. In the movie, Neo was taken out of the real world (reality is outside of the Matrix) and introduced to a new environment. It is through this experience that Neo comes to understand the truth about reality as he moves forward from the shadows to the light, and as he frees himself from the shackles on his mind.\n\n\nAllegory of the Cave is represented in the movie by the Matrix; the real world represented by the light at the far end of the cave; and the prisoners as the people who live in the Matrix.\n\nThe two different worlds are represented as follows:\n\nThe cave (The matrix) represents the virtual world in which Humans live; and humans in the real world are represented as the prisoners, who are attached to the wall of the cave.\n\nThe light at the end of the cave represents the real world. In the real world, Neo is represented as Socrates (the prisoner who comes to terms with the truth about reality) because he is the one who understands the cave as he progresses from the shadows to the light. He takes on the role of Socrates and becomes the one who frees himself in the real world, as in the Allegory of the Cave, because he is the one who understands the truth.\n\nThrough Neo's experience in the real world, the film relates to the Plato's quote that \"The road up and the road down are one and the same.\" (Republic) In Allegory of the Cave, the way out is through the gate (the path up and the path down is through the gate) and the path down represents the way in which Neo learns to accept the truth as opposed to running away from it. This implies that the path to accept the truth about reality, as depicted in Matrix, is through the light at the end of the cave.\n\n### Tone\n\nThroughout the movie, the tone is generally very optimistic. Neo is the hero. All of the students are young, and the main characters are portrayed in an idealistic manner.\n\n## Reception\n\nA"

This is also be the time of year where there are more locals in China rather than tourists.\n\nAutumn is the best time of year if you are interested in seeing all of the national parks in the country.\n\n### Ecological\n\nSome of the most compelling evidence for the importance of timing comes from observations of plants, animals, and ecosystems. For example, the best \"fishing\" month of the year at a given location may change drastically depending on whether it is warm, cool, or in between.\n\nTidepool at Asilomar\n\nFor example, Pacific salmon spend a minimum of two years of their lives in the ocean. They return to the stream or river where they were born to spawn or drop their eggs. But just because the fish \"know\" where they were born doesn't mean that the stream where they were born is a more appropriate location than other streams, rivers, and even ditches. What matters most is the physical and ecological characteristics of the stream. If conditions in the stream to which they return are favorable – that is, the water temperature reaches the point at which salmon embryos are able to develop and survive (17–18°C) – many salmon will return to that stream each year because the ecosystem there was favorable and nurtured their growth into adulthood.\n\nAside from the need for water temperatures that are just right, the timing of salmon migrations depends on the ecological needs of each species. The best time to return to spawn may be slightly different for each species, which is why some species return earlier and others return later. For example, juvenile pink salmon return sooner than do adult pink salmon.\n\nA number of Pacific salmon species return to their native streams of the northeastern Pacific to spawn (reproduce) only once. For these species, the timing of spawning is very important because this is the chance to produce the next generation and to"

Plus, sharing this feedback with your team will help them to improve their service so that more guests will leave reviews, which will raise your profile even more!\nFor guests to review your hotel, make sure you always provide them with opportunities. There are four different ways you can encourage guests to leave your hotel reviews.\nWhen you encourage guests to leave reviews, you are allowing your guests to share their opinions about your hotel and the services you offer. So, by encouraging your guests to leave reviews, they will have a chance to do so, which is important. Plus, if you ask them too, this will encourage your guests to leave feedback, as it shows guests their opinion is important to you.\nAsking guests to share their feedback is"

However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.\nIs == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference? Thanks!\n\nAnswer: `==` will work if the string to compare is not `null` or empty. It's very bad. `equals` compares the underlying data and will work with nulls but `==` will not\n\nComment: +1, this sums it up very nicely and explains why. Thanks!\n\nAnswer: It's not a bug, its just that Java is not a smart language like in the C++ world. Java should probably have an operator as below :\n\nString x = \"my String\";\n\nMyString y = \"my String\";\n\nif(y.equals(x)) //returns true if both are equal to each other\n\nif(y.isSameAs(x)) //returns true if both are same but not null\n\nAnswer: Use .equals() if the strings may be null or empty, ie if comparing for equality.\n\nIt will do a proper check for null first, then a compare of the underlying data.\n\nHowever if strings don't have an equals() method, then you should definitely use a 'reference equality test' to check if 2 strings are equal. ie they are equal if they have the same object.\n\nSometimes you make a string out of the same data as another string, but those strings would not be equal.\n\nAnswer: == will always return true if the str1 and str2 are not null, but equals will do a deep-check for nulls in the string, and then check the data (character by character) of the string, returning with it then being (data)equal. it will return false if one of them are null and the other aren't.\n\nAnswer: == will check for null-check.\nequals will check for string data, which can be null, if the string is \"null\", which will return false"

Note that $\\delta(i,j)$ is zero or positive.\n\nDefinition: Define $\\lambda(i)$ for $i>1$ as the minimum cost of transforming character i into character i+1.\n\nDefinition: Let $\\phi(i+1,j)$ for $i<j$ denote the minimum cost of moving from i+1 to character j.\n\nDefinition: Let $\\mu(i+1,j)$ for $i<j$ be the sum of the costs of $\\delta(i+1,j)$ + $\\phi(i+1,j)$ + $\\lambda(i)$ + 1.\n\nDefinition: Define $\\beta(i+1,j)$ for $i>j$ as $\\beta(i+1,j) = c(i+1,j)- c(i+1,j\\oplus i)$, where $\\oplus$ denotes a XOR operation.\n\nDefinition: Let $\\tau(j)$ for $j>1$ denote the minimum cost of transforming character j-1 into character j.\n\nDefinition: Let $A_j(j > 1)$ be the minimum cost of transforming j to j-1 and $B_j(j > 1)$ be the minimum cost of transforming j to the next non-empty element $j > k >1$.\n\nProblem Statement: Given a number n = {$i_1...i_s, ...i_p$} where for $i_k \\le i_{k+1}-1$, we are to determine the minimum cost of transforming n into n_{red}, and n_{red} = {i_1 ,...i_s,...i_p}.\n\nProblem Statement: Given a string $n = \\{i_1 \\rightarrow i_2,...,i_p\\rightarrow i_f\\}$ where only the last element i_f is the target index, and a cost $c(i_k,i_l)$, $k\\le l$, where we are to find the shortest sequence of moves so that $n$ can be transformed into $n_{red}$, $n_{red}$ = {$i_1 \\rightarrow i_2$,...$i_p \\rightarrow i_f$} and $i_f$ is a single number.\n\nThe original string is always of length more than that of the target.\n\nThe target can be on the first element of the original string or on the number that the original string is to be partitioned to.\n\nThe cost of transforming n is based on both the number of moves and the cost of moves.\n\nIt is required for this problem to return a minimum cost solution.\n\nSo, for example, n may be $i, i, a, b, $ $a, b, a, b, i, i$. Where the $a$ is the target number. Our solution returns something like n $= i, i, a, b, i, i, $ $a$, $b$. Where if you look, we have added 2 for the first two changes, 1 for the second two changes, and 1 for the last change.\n\nComment: You must find a way to minimize the cost of transformation for each possible substring without using the original string.

It should be your first instinct to know what it takes to qualify for the job and to make sure you have all the qualifying skills.\nIf you are smart enough to do the job they won't have to baby you.\nThere's this cool project I'd like to take on.\nIt won't get back with you right away and you might not get into that organization. That's how it stays in business. It's important to know how to sell your strengths while keeping your weaknesses to a minimum, or you could end up on the reject pile. They need a good manager. If they've ever hired a person and it's been a mess, a disaster, then they know they need to know more before hiring someone else. This shows that they will look to you for guidance and will trust your judgment. They don't know you at all.\nYou can say something like I was really excited to be hired because I knew I could make a difference. Sometimes a person is hired for a specific project and then given the choice to join them as a regular employee or to stay on at the company at a lower pay scale. Your future employer looks to hire people with similar personalities to build teams. So why do you want to work here?\nThey will give you more responsibility. If you come in and talk about doing it this way and do it that way, they will take your approach and it will be better. They don't know you are smart, they don't know you have done the job. If you show them, if they trust you and they find out that you've been truthful and really know what you're talking about, they are probably going to hire you. What other types of work do you like or have you done?\nYou can find out. So just know that if they ask you those questions and especially in the way that they are phrased that they are trying to get an idea of you as a person so they can determine if you will fit in their environment.\nI like a certain way and. Some of them are great interviews and some of them can be down right crazy. If you can describe someone who you have worked with and how they were, it helps the interviewer get an idea of how you will fit in with their team. They want to see that you know what you are doing.\nIf you tell the story well, tell a good story, the interviewer will know that you are a good performer. You want to see if there is a way to work out a situation where you're a little creative and get more out of it.\nThere's no excuses, you have to be able to show that you are a self-starter, that you don't have someone looking at your shoulder.\nYou are going to work with someone for 8 or 12 or 24 hours during the day. They are going to want to work with someone they can get along with. Some of them can be very personal.\nI'm a huge fan of Dilbert. You will be working with other people. They want to make sure you are not likely to run screaming, crying or having uncontrollable fits. But again, you need to be very cautious because people can overreact to these type of questions or interviewers. They have to know they can depend on you.

This is what separates the good programmers - those who can code in the interview -  from the elite programmers - those able to keep coding while listening to the interviewer describe a completely different solution.\n\nComment: In a coding interview, when faced with a new, \"unexpected\" problem/question, is the expectation that the interviewee should be able to write the solution to the problem, then stop to listen and take instructions on how to solve the problem a different way, then write the correct solution?  If so, a programming interview as a job fit check for your company is not a very good idea, since I would not be able to get my thoughts going while talking.  If not, this is the kind of thing that will throw me off the train, leading to a lower-than-expected grade.\n\nComment: The goal is to build a clear path forward, which you can then execute along. Of course this process will inevitably lead to more questions. Sometimes from the same interviewer who might go \"hmmm, we might want to modify this approach too\" - or another person who might ask for another approach to the same thing, to see how you'd handle the situation. Sometimes a different direction will be pointed to you because it has something to do with a question the interviewer already asked you earlier that you couldn't solve. It will go back and forth with various kinds of questions.\n\nComment: For example, at the start of the interview, you may have a question about how to solve some problem. The interviewer will then say, \"okay, let me see if I can make a solution along those lines. Would you like to hear it?\" I have heard people talk about it in this way, not everyone uses these words. Sometimes people hear questions as riddles and not in the context of coding interview where the wording could be different and less formal.\n\nComment: And a good interviewer will say \"you said...\" at a point and if you have lost the train of thought, you can say \"yes, I did that last I was thinking about it was in this context.\"  Otherwise you might look like you don't know what's going on. The main goal is to find out if the  candidate is capable of keeping up through the discussion, if not, then they won't be able to code in an interview either.\n\nComment: What you said is exactly what I have been getting from all the coding interview questions I have done here. When someone asks me the same question again, it usually is because they have found out some new facts about their problem definition, and that they believe this new information should be accounted for in the solution. So it's not really \"reconsidering the solution\" so much as reframing the entire problem in a new light. If you've been given a new input array, and a new list of values, as long as the interviewer isn't trying to trick you in this way (e.g. \"Now, what about if you are given three input arrays?\")\n\nComment: I think that for this to be a problem, the interviewer is essentially trying to do that to you, as they keep giving you new input array(s, lists, strings) and ask you to account for them in your solution. It is not reconsidering the solution, so to speak, but just redefining the *problem* as a new input. However, the problem still has the same structure, and you should apply the same solution you did already to the new input with just a few extra lines of code.\n\nComment: @Halirutan: that's a good point - but if the problem doesn't change then that means there are no valid answers - there is a single correct answer, which is to code the thing I want to"

        "output": "The given article should be checked for any scientific errors and corrected if necessary.\n\nZinc is an essential mineral that is required for good health. It is involved in many biochemical processes in the body and is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune system. Excess zink is not harmful as it is excreted in the urine. However, low zinc levels are associated with many chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity.\n\n## Deficiency\n\nDeficiency of zinc in the human body can manifest through signs and symptoms such as hair loss, loss of appetite, mouth ulcers, stunted growth, skin lesions, and impotence. The deficiency can lead to diseases such as impaired immune function, insomnia, and retarded wound healing. Zinc deficiency can be caused by lack of zinc in the diet and inadequate zinc absorption.\n\n## Functions\n\nThe function of zinc in the body is largely related to its involvement in numerous biochemical reactions. First, it plays a role as a structural component of many proteins in the body. It is found in proteins that mediate cellular immune function, which includes interferon and cell-mediated immunity. It also plays an important role in protein synthesis. It is found in the insulin, which is a protein that is used by the body to regulate blood sugar levels. Zinc has also been found to help regulate the metabolism of the body's energy compounds (glucose, amino acids, and fats) and the synthesis of cholesterol.\n\n## Sources of zinc\n\nZinc is present in many food groups. Sources of zinc in the diet include animal products such as meats, seafood, and poultry. Plant foods such as grains, vegetables, nuts, and seeds also provide zinc to humans.\n\n## Deficiency and toxicity\n\nThe deficiency of zinc can lead to many health problems. Impaired immune function is the most common symptom of zinc deficiency and is a result of low plasma zinc concentrations. Other deficiency symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, stunted growth, delayed wound healing, and an impaired sense of smell. Severe cases of zinc deficiency include diarrhea, dermatitis, and delayed sexual maturation.\n\nConsuming excess zinc is toxic to humans because zinc is poorly excreted by the body. As a result, zinc is stored in the liver in high amounts. A common symptom of toxicity is stomach pain as a result of liver and kidney damage. High concentrations of zinc in the urine are also found in patients with toxicity.\n\n## Interactions\n\nZinc affects the levels of many protein and enzyme metabolites in the body. It impacts the binding of certain amino acids to proteins, which has impacts on metabolism and detoxification. Zinc also affects the release of certain enzymes from cells. Zinc also impacts neurotransmitter metabolism and synaptic signaling. In addition, zinc affects copper homeostasis as a result of its role in the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). It should be noted that zinc is a required cofactor of most SOD isozymes in humans.\n\n## Clinical significance\n\nThere have been many known clinical conditions associated with zinc deficiency, including insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. In fact, zinc plays an important role in metabolism, energy production, and detoxification, which are all closely associated with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n\n### Chronic disease\n\nZinc and many protein factors play a pivotal role in inflammation and tissue remodeling. As such, it is crucial to have optimal levels of zinc in the body to decrease the risk of disease and improve treatment options for people with chronic pain and other chronic conditions. The lack of zinc has been linked to several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease. It has been shown that zinc reduces inflammation as a result of its effects on cytokines such as interleukin (IL"

This has led to the notion that the relationship between the Golden Ratio and aesthetic values and beauty is more than coincidental.\n\nOne of the oldest references to the golden ratio occurs in the Greek writer Euclid of Alexandria, who in his Elements (book XIII, propositions 4-6), which contains his definitions of the golden ratio and of its reciprocal, writes:\n\nAnd it (the line segment containing the points P and Q) is to the whole line AB as CP is to AB, inasmuch as PH/AC = CP/AB (for H is the mean proportional between P and C). Let now CP have a length equal to AB, and divide AB by the mean between CP and C. In this way the whole line [ACP] is to the semiperimeter of the triangle CAP as the length of the semiperimeter [ACP] is to that of the whole line AB.\n\n— Book XIII, Propositions 4–6: The Golden Section, Euclid, Elements\n\nThe ancient Greek sculptor Polykleitos stated in his 4th-century BC Canon that the ideal proportions of the male human body are related mathematically to the Golden Ratio:\n\nIn proportionate measurements from the upper surface to the lower surface, the upper surface will be to the lower surface as the foot is to the height.\n\n— Polykleitos, Canon, circa 400 BC\n\nIn the 7th century BC the Pythagoreans, among other things, sought to prove that the Golden Ratio was used in proportions of the human body:\n\nSo that the ratio of man to the measure of the one-and two-dimensional bodies of those animals that exist by nature may be equal to the square of a certain number that is taken in their natural proportions.\n\n— Pythagoras and Pythagoreans, (1) Aristotle (384–322 BC), in his Prior Analytics 55b, circa 325 BC translated by B. Jowett, quoted in J. R. R. Tolkien (1994). \"Faerie\". In Humphrey Carpenter (ed.). The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams (First ed.). London; Boston: George Allen & Unwin."

        "output": "Improve the article using your knowledge of the topic in order to make it more informative.\n\nThe \"fair trade\" movement, also known as the \"trade justice\" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.\n\nThe fair trade movement was inspired by the 1960s counterculture, and was the result of a number of related movements, including environmentalism, human rights, and pacifism. In addition, fair trade is an effort to counter what fair-trade advocates call \"free trade deals\" or \"free trade agreements\". Free trade deals are agreements that are made between two or more countries to decrease or remove tariffs and taxes on certain goods that both countries are involved in producing. The goal is to increase consumer choice and protect the environment. However, these deals do not always apply to workers' rights and the environment, and usually do not affect the price of locally available goods.\n\n## Fair trade movement (1960s - today)\n\nFair trade (which can also be known by other names, such as ethical trade) is a system for promoting sustainable economic development through trade in the production of crafts, agricultural products, other raw materials and consumer goods.\nIt is the practice of buying products from the third world and selling them domestically for a profit. In addition to the profit made by the third world country the profit made by the first world country is also considered fair trade.\n\nThe modern fair-trade movement was born in Germany in 1986 when a small group of activists (the Ivory Alliance) challenged the Deutscher Verband des Deutschen Ivory Handels (German Ivory Trading Association) to make fair trade a reality by developing rules and regulations which would protect elephants and the people who live with them. The Association quickly accepted this challenge and, together with a group of specialized NGOs (Nicholas Wolz), developed the World's first Fair Trade Ivory Rules, which have since been approved and adopted as the \"International Ivory Protocol\" by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1989.\n\nThe International Ivory Protocol required member nations to introduce new regulations prohibiting the trade of raw ivory except to those with special permission. Since 1989 the Ivory Protocol has effectively stopped the trade of raw ivory, which has led to the recovery of almost one-million elephants. By 2008 the number of Asian elephants had risen to 44,000 from the previous estimated 15,000 to 20,000.\n\n### Early development of the fair trade movement\n\nDespite this success, the World Fair Trade Organization, founded in 1989, began to doubt that fair-trade production was the most effective way to help the world's needy as consumer tastes began to change and environmental concerns began to dominate the social and political climate. Thus, WFTO launched the Alternative Fair Trade Alliance (AFTA) in 1993 to address these concerns in a manner that would benefit workers in the Global South and enhance the environment.\n\nAs a result, the first international fair trade organizations, which are now independent from WFTO, were formed. The Swiss Network of Fair Trade Organizations (SNV) focused its initial efforts on improving coffee farmers' economic well being and increasing productivity in the coffee industry. In 1998, the SNV created Equal Exchange, which specializes in supplying coffee, tea, chocolate, and other agricultural products to North American consumers. Equal Exchange works with over 60 producer groups in at least 20 developing countries.\n\nOther fair-trade organizations focusing on tea include the Fair Trade Tea Association (FTTA). The FTTA provides training and support to tea estates in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Kenya. The International Women's Coffee Alliance (IWCA) is another fair-trade organization which deals primarily with coffee but also works with people who produce sugar, tea, cocoa, and chocolate. IWCA emphasizes the importance of coffee cultivation within women's lives in Latin American where coffee cultivation is the predominate industry. By buying fair-trade coffee, consumers help"

The invention of musical amplification and electronic instruments, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized classical and popular music, and accelerated the development of new forms of music. Such experiments with musical form had precedents in classical music, with Arnold Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire for instance having a different poem for each song. Jazz music, which originated from the traditional music of the African Americans in the beginning half of the 1900s, led to more complex rhythms that developed into a variety of styles from main jazz subgenres: Afro-Cuban jazz, swing (sometimes known as big band jazz) and jazz blues. Traditional western tonal music was dominant for most of the 20th century. Many new styles emerged, including minimalism, electro-acoustic music, and modernism, such as in the works of John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\n## Popular music\n\nPopular music is music that many enjoy as a form of entertainment and expression. It is performed by popular music artists and music bands, and typically sold at a physical (CD's, cassettes, vinyl records) or a digital level (downloading or streaming of the music). Popular music is also called Hit Music or Top 40 Music and often sells for a higher price than other music genres because it is more mainstream and more commercial. In some cases, popular or mainstream music could be used interchangeably, but the definition to determine which music falls in this genre is based on several general principles.\n\n### Music genre\n\nMain article: Music genre\n\nMain article: Music style\n\n* Music genre: a type of music that shares similar characteristics, sounds, and features\n* Music style: the combination of music genres\n\n### Music artist\n\nMain article: Musician\n\n* Music artist: a musician or band who produces and publishes music\n\n### Music label\n\nMain article: Record company\n\n* Record company: an organization, company branch, a team of companies that produces and publishes music and is related to artists\n  * Music record label: a branch or a subdivision of a record production company which creates, produces, and publishes recorded music, for profit or nonprofit\n  * Record company: a music company that controls the rights to an artist's music and records\n  * Independent record label: a record company that is autonomous and operates without oversight from major record labels or any multinational corporation\n  * Indie record label: (Independent record label)\n  * Music distribution: the means (usually companies) of releasing music commercially, often independently distributed music distribution\n  * Specialty record label: a record label with a focus on one type of music, and generally a smaller, more personal operation\n  * Independent music label: an independent record label\n  * Record production company: organization responsible for the promotion and distribution of artists.\n\n## Ragtime\n\nMain article: Ragtime\n\nGershwin playing the piano\n\nRagtime is a musical theater style that blended European classical music traditions with syncopated African rhythms. Ragtime was extremely popular in the United States, Europe, and South America during the late 1890s, early 20th century and its popularity helped facilitate the rise of such popular jazz musicians as Scott Joplin, James R. Johnston, Jelly Roll Morton, and Joseph Lamb.\n\nA rags performance time range from five to ten minutes in duration and it can be performed by piano, a quartet, a trio, or a duet. The music has a strong syncopation component which often makes the audience to tap their feet. Ragtime involves piano playing styles that can be difficult for even the most skilled pianists to perform. Ragtime is typically seen as a precursor to the jazz and classical music genres.\n\n## See also\n\n* Bibliography of 20th-century classical music\n* Lists of years in music (containing 19th century, 20th century,"

That is one definition. If you want to use a strict one, it's any quality or property that can be used to distinguish or identify an entity. That is also a definition. \"Characteristic\", while usually defined in one way or the other, is not specifically defined as a subset of \"trait\".\n\nComment: *Traits are characteristic similarities across a group of diverse individuals.\nIf you were asking for a trait, I may say that \"Jimmy\" has a strong trait of being shy, yet another may say he is timid. \"Shy/Timid\", are characteristics, thus, it is not a trait.

They are companies that do the\n  physical clearing of money in commercial banks by maintaining banks accounts. They are privately owned and\n  operated and generally do this in exchange for a fee. Most of these clearing systems today are using a cryptocurrency technology developed by Nick Szabo called Bit Gold that was later refined into a digital currency called Bitcoin by Satoshi (Nakamoto) in 2008. All cryptocurrencies are built using these two technologies.\n  These digital currencies allow transactions to occur without having to use a third party or middle man. This enables transactions to be made directly between two individuals, eliminating the need to pay transaction fees and sometimes even exchange fees. While such digital payment systems can exist without being directly involved in trading cryptocurrencies, they do not come bundled with cryptocurrencies.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnd chapter 9 covers:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhile paying fees is necessary for using payment processing services directly, the payment processing service may use a third party to accomplish the physical settlement of money. In that case, the payment processors (i.e. electronic clearing houses) must take care that the fee charged by the service provider to the customer is less than or equal to the fee they paid to the entity which actually performs the\n  physical settlement of money. This is to ensure that the fees the consumer pays into the clearing house are\n  sufficient to cover their fees plus profit.\n  The fee is a payment for the services provided by the clearing house. Because electronic clearing houses allow\n  money to be moved and exchanged with much less effort than physically moving money, they represent\n  significant cost savings to their users. And as one company, Clearing Corporation, explains their services:\n\n  \\strong{\\em{“In many cases companies do not need to physically transmit funds, they simply rely on"

I know I want to see Fes and Marrakesh and have included them in my itinerary. Should I consider including a few more days there? I am looking for recommendations on what to see. Also what is the preferred way? To take airlines? And train? How much time can be covered by trains. Thanks for your help.\n\nAnswer: You seem to want to see both the Northern cities of (Marrakesh, Fes, Merzouga) and the Southern cities of (Casablanca, Essaouira, Agadir). If you wish to cover the Marrakech-Agadir area, then the best mode of travel is probably a train or a private taxi, as that area is very deserty.\n\nIf you wish to see the Northern cities, I'd suggest using a combination of trains and buses, as the city of Marrakesh (being in the north) is a perfect place to start your Moroccan experience, and Marrakesh, Casablanca and Agadir can be easily reached by train from Marrakech.\n\nThe 9 day itinerary proposed below is a general idea of how I'd suggest visiting the area in question, and would involve leaving the country once (after 9 days), but if it were me, I'd add another week or so (leave the country twice) to travel all the way to Essaouira and back again.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Go to Marrakesh. Spend your time in Marrakesh. After your time in Marrakesh, board the train to Casablanca. This train journey should take less than 6 hours. In Casablanca, check into a decent (but affordable) hotel, then spend the rest of your time in the city.\n  \\item Head on to Agadir (the southernmost city of northern Morocco) by taking a bus from Casablanca. It should take about 3 hours to get there. Spend a day or so in Agadir, then board a train to Essaouira. This train takes approx 3 hours from Agadir. Spend any remaining time in Agadir in Essaouira, a seaside town, 4-5 hours south of Agadir, a day trip from Essaouira is worthwhile. Stay in Essaouira for the rest of the time.\n  \\item Go to Marrakech, spend the rest of your time there.\n  \\item Depart Morocco heading for Algeria (Algiers or Tlemcen) by plane or train, as you prefer.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIf you wish to do a little bit less than this itinerary proposes, I'd suggest:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Go to Marrakech\n  \\item Spend your time in Marrakech.\n  \\item After your stay in Marrakech, spend about 1 day in Casablanca, then board a train to Essaouira. Travel to Essaouira by train should probably take less than 5 hours.\n  \\item Spend time in Essaouira.\n  \\item Spend the rest of the time in Marrakech.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: +1, I think it's a bit more complicated to go from Agadir to Essaouria, given the mountain range in between.\n\nComment: I would add \"in Marrakech make a city tour and then return to Agadir.\"\n\nComment: @A.L. and dpeggian Thank you for your inputs. The itinerary that I have is: 1. Flight from London to Marrakeach  2. On day 2 have city tour in Marrakesh and on day 3 return to the UK.  Then I have a day gap so I thought I could travel on day 4 to Casablanca and from Casablanca to Tlemcen. I thought I could spend 2 days in Tlemcen . Then on day 7 return flight to UK or return flight from Algiers and spend 2 days in Essaouira.\n\nComment: Thanks @A.L. I agree that my 9 days seems a little too little for the Marrakech part, and"

        "output": "Give students tips on how to keep their nerves under control during class presentations. A simple guide on how to be confident during your presentation. In a small group, you can try various examples of different speeches to find the ones that work best for the group as a whole. This is done by simply speaking in a large group and letting the students provide the cues to pause, or to go slower or faster. It doesn't matter if you're doing a lecture or a presentation, having a set of notes is useful. It can help you get over your nervousness if you don't have to look at something with written words. This is a good way of getting you thinking about the points you are going to make. It is also an effective technique as it involves two different things at the same time. It can be very useful to rehearse a presentation a number of times. The more you rehearse, the more familiar you become with the material. This helps to remove some of the nervousness about delivering the presentation because it stops you being afraid of the content! Another useful way of overcoming your nerves is to rehearse the presentation in front of friends or family - who will give you supportive, encouraging feedback. Another good way to get over your nerves is to relax by doing something that will make you happy before you start giving the presentation. What's stopping you? Do it anyway! And if the presentation is too late in the day, go do something fun before then (but don't drink alcohol the night before as it's not going to help you at all!), which will then help you to relax a bit and get you into the right frame of mind before you deliver the presentation. Don't spend too much time on every detail of the presentation! Presentations should be short, sweet and to the subject. You will give a much better presentation if you have something to say of value to the audience than if you are reading from notes for hours. It's OK! If you do forget or are taken off track by a question during the presentation, try to do something with the question (even if you ask the questioner to wait until the end and then ask it of the group). It's a good idea to get to know someone in the audience ahead of time, so you can introduce them to everyone after you are done speaking. It's good to get feedback after a presentation to help improve future. Try to get a few questions from the audience after each one. Don't be afraid to make mistakes during a presentation. Sometimes, not knowing something can be just as positive as knowing something. It's a good idea to have some notes to carry during the presentation, but don't read them out. The notes will serve as a prompt if you forget what you were going to say, but it is much better to speak from memory than to read from a script. Don't forget that your audience will appreciate it if you are prepared ahead of time. Being prepared shows that you care about your presentation. Don't be afraid to get up and move around. It can help to keep you focused on what you are saying. It's a good idea to have a friend come with you to your presentation in case you get nervous. They can help you to keep on track and feel calmer if you have a friend with you. Don't speak the words in \"parrot\" fashion. Instead, try to speak in a more natural voice (but still with a bit of passion in it). It's OK to make mistakes! If you mess up, don't get too upset or afraid. Just keep going! Most of the worst speakers you have heard have only gone off on a tangent rather than speaking with a little lack of confidence (they just haven't kept going). If you get nervous, it's OK to laugh at yourself. That will stop you from becoming anxious and may even make the audience feel more comfortable, too. Keep doing it! If you get nervous, don't laugh at yourself, try to take it out on someone or something else. If you hit a rut in your presentation, don't stop and try to get back on track. It's OK If you get off your subject for a while. Try to get back on it as soon as possible and don't apologise. Be nice! If you think that the audience is not going to agree with everything you are saying, don't be so negative about the subject. Instead, try to be nice and find some things that the audience does agree with. Don't forget that you are talking to the audience, so make sure that you are talking to them as \"individuals\". People in the audience aren't stupid, even if they don't agree with you. And they won't hold it against you if you point out some of the"

Don't capitalize the beginning of a sentence or a title.\n\nAnswer: At the end of the book, the green light symbolizes the hope of renewal; renewal for Gatsby, and his hope of getting together with Daisy. Even though Jay has the opportunity to make his dreams come true, he never takes any action steps to pursue renewal for himself, or the possibility of a relationship with Daisy.\n\nFrom the last paragraph of the book:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI had meant what I said about being able to forgive him, and I could. I was thinking of it all the time I was dressing, \\strong{I hoped she would forgive me, too}! It seemed to me that I owed her some explanation, a plea in mitigation, the story of my life perhaps, though I couldn't give it now for anything \\strong{since it was the green light, the old familiar green light, that \\em{had} haunted me.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item I hope she will forgive me, (as she deserves to be forgiven)\n\\item I owe her some explanation, I should plead in mitigation before her\n\\item I \\em{need} to tell her my life story (\"I should like to be of use to her\")\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{What is the meaning of the colour of the green light?}\n\nThe colour of the green light symbolizes the life of hope, dreams, and renewal Gatsby dreams of, and hope that the old dreams are within his reach. Gatsby is a man who doesn't \"let\" himself feel anything beyond hope and dreams, and the novel makes it clear that his hope is a \"new green life\" with Daisy. She is the hope of renewal he looks for, and in the end, it is in vain.\n\nIt is interesting that you note \\em{old} dreams and \\em{old} green light. This is significant in that it suggests that his hope of renewal in the past was not in vain, and therefore that Daisy's future \\em{wasn't} something he had a hope in that was \"old\". The \"old\" is a reference to the past, and he didn't seek renewal with the past in his dreams.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI thought suddenly that I would like to come back one summer\n  – ten years later on, perhaps - and try to reconstruct everything.\n  \\strong{I wonder if he’ll still be standing there.}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe colour also symbolizes how in the end he doesn't take any steps in his renewal.\n\nComment: As you noted earlier, the quote *the old familiar green light* is actually a reference to her home back east where she's lived all her life; the same one he saw while waiting for her to come to his party so long ago. That doesn't fit with any meaning of *symbolizing* renewal. That's the same as *dreaming on*.\n\nComment: @DanRomik The quote says that \"it is the green light\", not *\"it *symbolizes*\" the light. I was under the impression that Gatsby does what he does for the hope that his dreams of his life with her might come true, and in the end they fail.\n\nComment: Sure, he does that, but that's not what he thinks of the green light. It's a thing, it's a color; it's not a symbol. You're misreading *The Great Gatsby* if that's what you're trying to say.\n\nComment: I can easily see how you could take the end quote (which comes after the green light has failed him)as *I had meant what I said about being able to forgive him, and I could. I was thinking of it all the time I was dressing, *I hoped she would forgive me, too*! It seemed to me that I owed her some explanation, a plea in mitigation, the story of my life perhaps, though I couldn't give it now for anything since it was the green light, the old familiar green light, that *had* haunted...\n\nComment: I'm not trying to read into what Fitzgerald might have intended at all; I'm"

This could be a hypnosis exercise where the mind is mentally directed to feel relaxed and calm. The patient may be instructed to repeat a positive and calming statement such as “I am confident and confident.” The patient may even be instructed to repeat this affirmation when they start to get nervous about the test or appointment. A technique like this is often effective because the patient already knows how to do it. If the patient is not very confident in the technique, the patient may be given a hypnosis tape about how it works. If the patient does not do well with this method, there are always other methods that the patient may be advised by the therapist. Exhibit R For some people, it may be helpful to practice certain relaxation techniques before an appointment or test, to help them feel less anxious. Some of these techniques include: Deep breathing (breathing in and out slowly for 10-15 seconds), concentrated attention on a single point (such as the tip of the nose or the throat), or the application of pressure on a particular point on the hand (such as acupuncture). These techniques help to reduce anxiety and the physical effects of anxiety, to help promote the psychological relaxation. Other methods the patient may be advised to try are: Imagining an uplifting and relaxing scene, such as sitting on a beach watching waves, or a beautiful park in springtime.

Do you focus on making things? Do you listen to music?\nI think about things.\nAlso about things.\nAnd then things.\nI do not have a process. My \"process is me having stuff to think about. A lot of my thinking is influenced by the stuff that I've read, but most that influences me is things that I've been exposed to in real life...like talking to a real live human being, either in person of over the phone. Or reading something in real life.\nI keep a notes app on my phone for the stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere - sketches or lists of what I need to do, or just random shit out of my head, or anything else. I can search it, find things, and figure out what I thought a week ago. I'll find a note, and I'll look back on it. If something doesn't make sense, I'll make a new note and ask myself why. That helps me figure shit out.\nI use Sketchbook Pro for what little art I put into the world. I also use it for brainstorming, and I'll just throw stuff out of my head onto the screen. Anything else, I do by hand. I also have a couple other notebooks that have random sketches and notes in them. Sometimes I'll take a break from working and I'll go for a walk, and I'll think things about. Whatever it works.\nThe best way for me to get new ideas is to get lost in the shit that got me going in the first place, to see something that I thought of in the first place and figure out how it might apply to a whole different thing. Sometimes it's just to go somewhere and be like \"oh shit, I need a new idea, what do I do\" and just let my brain wander onto whatever else it thinks about.\nI use a notes app on my phone for brainstorming, outlining, and taking notes of whatever I don't have time to sit down and type out. That's mostly the brain exercises. Other than that, I don't have a process. Shit that's in my brain wafts out into the ether and whatever comes back, I put that in the notes app and work with it from there.\nI should also mention that I love writing in notebooks for that sort of thing. I've only gotten into digital sketching because of the convenience. But with notebooks, the brain is slower, but not distracted. No notifications to keep track of. If you want to take notes, you can't look elsewhere. You've got to face it.\nYou wanna know what the secret is to brainstorming? It's a simple thing, and it's not really all that new-age/out there. It's an idea. The idea that no idea is too silly or even that bad to throw away. The first time you came up with the idea of X, was it a crappy idea? Was it boring? Not very unique? Boring, right? Well, that was nothing but an obstacle. It wasn't a good idea, it was an old idea...but that doesn't matter. Don't you throw away an idea with a boring premise.\nIt's all about playing around with the idea. This thing, whatever it is, where do you see this taking place? What's in the background? Who are the characters? I have to admit something here. Something that I always seem to leave out when people talk about brainstorming and \"not having an idea\". You can have as many ideas as you want...there are no limits. But the idea that everyone keeps talking about is the \"one\" good idea. There's nothing wrong with that. It can happen, and it might even be all that you need to do to get started. But why? If your \"premise\"/idea is boring as hell. Why do you think that's the best idea? Because you came up with it? I'll put it out there: you're full of shit.\nWhen I'm looking for \"the one\" to use, I do so, but I will often look at 3 or more or maybe just 5 that would allow me to use my skills with them. In this case, I was actually trying to make sure I had an idea to do something specific as a challenge with a coworker and we were tasked with writing these things. One was essentially a"

I believe this is why I wasn't able to solve it myself.\n\nComment: @Pitfall  Yes you are correct. I am a student and thought that this was a more mathematical based question. I asked a professor about this and he told me to wait on the answer.\n\nAnswer: Given you can't use multiple `AND` statements, you would need to apply a `SWITCH` statement to determine which `IF/ELSE` statements were to be used. The main issue in what you have written is that you currently use `AND` to determine whether the activity should be included in the query or not, while actually what needs to be checked is whether there is a path from the start node to the end node \\strong{that} passes through the `activity` node that is currently being considered.\n\nTry this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nboolean canVisit( Activity activity, Node node ) {\n    return !pathTo( node ).path.contains( activity );\n}\n\nboolean pathTo( Node node ) {\n\n    return(node.id == startNodeId || node.id.equals(activityNodeId));//  //node.children.contains(activityNodeId))\n\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nIt could be further improved by adding other conditions to the path `to` method, e.g. that the path is not completely backwards relative to the start node, or that the activity node has more than 1 child node.\n\nComment: @Pitfall The professor who gave me this assignment is looking for an algorithm that takes in a query and returns a specific Node and ActivityNode. For example, if the user gave the query of \"Showers\" AND \"F\" then the Node would equal _F_ and the activityNode would equal _Showers_\n\nComment: I understand how the algorithm works now. I needed that switch statememt on the pathTo function for the query to work. Thank you very much for your help and your patience with my question! :)\n\nComment: @Pitfall Now my only problem is trying to learn how to read the code again before next class."

        "output": "Design a template table for keeping track of all subscriptions. This will keep your email marketing in check. Make sure you capture email addresses when someone subscribes. Send an email newsletter to every person in your list and ask them to forward to friends. Design template emails, inviting them to take part, with instructions on where they should go and how to contribute. Don t forget to include a place for readers to share feedback. 12\n13 Step 2 How do I raise money? Get people to donate to the cause. Design email appeals specifically seeking donations. (Always make sure you are clear about which organization you are raising donations for.) Send appeals to friends and family. If you want to raise money from the public more widely, design appeals that invite participation, and include information on who and where to send a cheque. Step 3 What does the project need? Make a list of resources required for the project, and budget accordingly. Research prices of resources (materials, services, travel, accommodations, etc.). Get offers of help from friends and family. Use the list of resources for the project. Use emails and social media to coordinate and mobilize volunteers. 13\n14 Step 4 How do I sell product? Figure out which businesses sell goods that can be turned into a product, and approach them with your idea. Develop a product prototype, and show it to businesses that make the same thing. You should do this research step first, as it will limit your choices for manufacturers. Once you have a list of manufacturers, ask each if you can create a sample, and offer one to each of them if they want it. They might pay for it or you might get it for free. It is important to contact each possible manufacturer and ask them about their interest and pricing. Make a business plan for making the product. Consider pricing, branding, and funding. Get prices from manufacturers, and keep an eye out for cheaper ones. If pricing with one company makes no sense, find out the next cheapest company to make it. Design a prototype, or at the least create a digital or physical mockup of how the product will look. Develop a business plan including the goals and costs of creating and marketing the product, and how to make a profit. Determine what you need to do in order to bring your idea to market. Figure out what kind of product you want to make, and who might make it. Create a prototype. Write a business plan. Bring to market. 14\n15 5 How do I promote? Promote early and often, especially within your community where it will have the most effect. Don t wait until you think the product is ready to make its debut. Write about your project early in blogs and publications where your target audience reads, with the intention to draw in the media. Write about your project to create connections with the public, and keep you in the public eye. Promote on social media (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are a good start). In addition to using these platforms, design attractive messages and photos, and make them available as downloads. Design eye catching posters and flyers, to promote in the real world, and be prepared to hand them out. Create a viral campaign around your product/project. Keep an eye out for news stories about your product or project. When a positive one emerges, contact journalist. Ask them about any story, but especially those where your project is involved as an expert. Let them know about other people you can speak to who are interested and expert in your topic. Don t just rely on the media though, but have a promotions team to use social media to spread the word, and send out press releases. You may have to invest some money in promotion, but look at it as an investment. Think what it will be worth once news of your project reaches the public. You may also have to work a certain number of hours for free, helping out while making connections. But this is part of the deal, and there are plenty of rewards. (It s also worth noting this promotional and contact-building work gets you a whole lot further than hiring a big PR agency to do the exact same job.) 15\n16 Step 6 How do I promote locally? Identify the organizations and leaders who influence your community. Be sure to target those who are interested in your project, and the people they influence. Write articles and press releases to newspapers and magazines of interest. Write letters, articles, and blog posts about your project, and why people should be interested in it or involved. Contact local political agencies to get your project on the agenda. Develop a local fundraising campaign. Host fundraising events in public places, and promote them in newspapers,"

Meeting Objectives The purpose of this meeting is to allow team members to determine processes and practices that will allow them to become more effective on the next iteration. To do this, they need to examine the processes and practices of the current iteration, and then recommend and implement the necessary process and practice changes that will enable them to be more productive and efficient on their next iteration. The team members can propose and try out new practices, but only those that they deemed successful, and those that get used should be written down as improvements that need to be documented and made permanent. If an improvement is proposed and not used on the next iteration, then it should be documented in the improvement file, and be reviewed with the team members to verify validity.

She says that it is highly uncertain whether the Japanese \"person\" words for any animal stem from a bear, but says that in the case of words for a bear, the animal word could have been borrowed from the Ainu or from the \"Jomon culture\". The two words in Kim's summary were in fact taken directly from Miyake and Kim 1978 pp. 153–154.\n\nThe first of these two examples, the verb hakkī and the noun hokkī, have been adopted by people in general and are found in dictionaries and textbooks. In fact the \"bear\" sense of hokkī was found in a Japanese-English dictionary in England, but hokkī could be used to mean a person or creature from a bear family. However this dictionary definition is no longer cited in dictionaries and textbooks. Hokkī is also used by some people and is listed by Yamamoto in his dictionary as a word that has been \"released\" from being a bear word, for use as a general word (p. 966). But despite all this, hakkī and hokkī have remained true to the sense of \"bear\" that they had when they were first used by Ainu. In fact, in one dictionary, there is still a note that says that these two words can be \"misused\" and the dictionary offers some examples, e.g. \"a great man, a hero\" ([R] Ikumi shirō). This dictionary suggests that these two words should only be used as the names or nicknames of people of \"brave\" or \"big\" character. This is still an unusual sense of these words for people who are not Ainu, and so they are not used for these qualities. For this reason, the words can be said to be restricted to their \"original\" sense, \"bear\". (For more, see [H3] below.)\n\n## 2. Abe and his bear family\n\n\"The little bear's mother and father are looking for him\" (from [15]).\n\nOne day a little boy went off to play and came to another boy who had a bear with him. This boy put the bear in the boy's bag and took the boy off to his house. The little boy was sad. \"I want my bear\" he said to Abe, who lived in that country. Abe said \"I'd like my bear too\". He got on his horse and galloped off to the boy who had the bear. When he reached the boy's house, he was crying and Abe asked what was wrong. The boy said \"I want my own bear, why doesn't Abe let me have one?\". Abe said: \"Why don't you give up your bear and come with me\". The little boy said \"okay\" and he gave up his bear. So Abe and the little boy got on his horse together and galloped off, and then at the same time, Abe and the little boy got on their horses and galloped off separately. The little boy and Abe met up and Abe said to the boy at the same time that the boy's mother and father had found him. Abe was so happy!\n\nThis story is recorded in [15] pp. 102–103 of Kim and Tanaka's translation of Miyake's Ainu Legends.\n\nWhat about the Ainu words for bear? This story is an explanation of why bears and humans don't look alike. Why, in fact, do any bear words look like human words? Could bears, for example, have an Ainu word like hakkī? It is also about why bears don't cry in the Ainu way. Why does the Ainu version of the story of the Talking Bear have a different ending?\n\nThe Ainu version of the Talking Bear story has the same"

Kick return yards Scoring yards in the endzone Receiving yards in the endzone Why do you think the reporter calls that stat the “endzone” stat? The statistics can be calculated based on the type of play\n5 Addition and subtraction Addition and subtraction For example, a running back has 6 rushes for 66 yards before getting tackled! There are a variety of other categories to keep track of so it’s essential to use math to help you. Addition and subtraction help to calculate these statistics. How do we figure out: - what a player’s statistics look like? A running back has 6 rushes for 66 yards before getting tackled! You would add six to the number of rushes which would be 12 (2 more than 10). You multiply 6 x 12 = 72 yards. How do we calculate: - how much more time we have at two minutes and thirty-two seconds left in the 3rd quarter? A football game has 4 quarters. Two minutes and thirty-two seconds is exactly 120 seconds. This is twenty-four seconds less than two minutes. How much time is gone and how many seconds? There are 120 seconds remaining in the 3rd quarter. 120 seconds remaining – 24 seconds = 96 seconds remaining. 96 seconds – 60 seconds per minute x 3 minutes = 54 seconds remaining.\n6 How much time is left at half-time? How do we calculate how much time remains in half-time? A football game has 4 quarters. Half-time is halfway into a game. Half-time ends with the amount of time 12:00. 60 seconds per minute x 120 total time in minutes x 0.5 = 6 to the .5 time. - What is the difference between the offense’s running yards and the defense’s stopping yards? Which player do you think had the most rushing yards at the halfway point?\n7 Using graphs Using graphs By doing this, you can create a bar graph and track all the stats of the running backs. You track, using your data table, how his yardage looks throughout the game. How did it increase from start to finish? How much was gained over the first forty yards?\n8 Conclusion In conclusion, it is evident that the following information was vital in organizing a football game. By watching and understanding football, you can also gain knowledge about math. Math is a skill that helps to determine stats, time in between plays, how many people each team has on the field, how much time is left and more. The following information was used in determining how many plays a running back has after the first, second, and fourth quarter. Math also helped to calculate the number of tackles each defender received. By analyzing the stats, it was then easier to determine how the game went and who won.\nDownload ppt \"A Football Game Football is a very popular sport and is watched by millions of people around the world each season.

It’s a gesture that can tell people you’re not a bitter person. So keep showing a smile always!\n4. Enjoy life\nIf you think that the worst thing that can happen to you is that you’ll get sick or die, you’re lucky. Consider yourself as a winner if you can survive all your illnesses.\n5. Accept who you are\nYou should have to love yourself no matter what. Love yourself so much that nobody ever have to hurt you again. So be yourself, be proud of yourself and stop hiding. Keep this in mind everyday.\n6. Be Optimistic!\nNo matter what happen if you can always be an optimistic person, I believe you would become a better person. You can always see the bright side of life, no matter how bad your life is.\nThere will be always someone will tell you they don’t like you. It’s not something worth worrying about though. Let them continue their wrong path of life and just stay focused on what you want. You will be surprised, you’ll gain many friends in the end.\nHaving the courage to say yes, is more important than having a good plan to say no. You don’t have a great idea, but decide to do it anyway.\nWorries, problems, and challenges are part of everyone’s life. What matters the most is how you deal with it. Don’t let life beat you, be beat it!\nIf you ask people about you one day, what do you want them to say?\nI’m the nicest person ever.\nI’m the most beautiful person ever.\nI’m the smartest person ever.\nI’m the best person ever.\nAll those questions are similar. But you should know that you are the best and the nicest person ever. Love yourselves!\nHow to have a happy life?\nHaving a happy life means, having a successful mindset. Having a positive or optimistic mindset can help you to face all those difficulties. I’d like to share with you the quote from Steve Maraboli that has changed my life.\n1. Happiness is never about how you look, so you can put all the makeup on or go to the gym for two hours, but you still won’t be happy. And it’s not about how much money you have or how many people who love you. Happiness for me has everything to do with your mindset and your heart. Your attitude towards life and what it has to throw at you. You can be happy if you choose to be and see the bright side of life.\n2. If you love it, and it makes you happy. It’s the thing to do. If your passion becomes your profession, you’ll be happier for the rest of your life. You will be living your dreams. And that’s what matters the most!\n3. I don’t want to spend my days thinking about what could happen if I had been a different person. I’m here now and I believe it’s too early to think about the future. Whatever I try to do, I can always learn and improve. So just focus on being the best person you can be in the present time.\nI have never really thought about what it means to be happy or what’s the right way to choose happiness, until I read that quote. It is true. Happiness doesn’t depend on what you do, how much money you have either if someone loves you or not. Happiness depends on how you feel at the moment. If you’re happy and positive, it’s means everything in your life at the present time. That’s why I’m positive. I’m happy always. I’m just happy to be living."

She also enjoys eating kittens. Despite her tough demeanour, she can be seen crying very easily. The main target of her abuse is her class of children and this includes her favourite student, Bruce Bogtrotter so she often abuses him.\nHumour and sarcasm also play a part in Miss Trunchbull's mood, and this shows in the way she talks and behaves throughout the book, often making fun of students such as Bruce, and even Matilda.\n\nThe Wormwoods\nMatilda's parents. At first, they seem very kind and nice towards their daughter. However, they turn out to be not so nice after all. Her mother is a famous TV celebrity and her father seems to not care for Matilda because he's too busy thinking up ideas, for TV, and writing letters to the Prime Minister. Despite being so famous, Matilda's parents do not realize how their lack of love for Matilda and constant ignoring is doing harm to their daughter.\n\nMatilda\nA 5-year-old girl with very special powers. She makes her parents very proud when she goes and teaches Miss Honey how to read. Also she likes to read and learns faster than anyone Matilda's age.\n\nMiss Honey\nMatilda's kind and caring teacher. She first meets Mr and Mrs Wormwood who make a joke at her expense and seem very unimpressed by her. This is because they do not treat other people very nicely and do not realize how their own selfishness is hurting them, too. Miss Honey is very gentle and kind, however this also allows people to take advantage of her, the headmistress included. She is very intelligent and a kind student.\n\n## History\n\nMs. Richards began her career as an actress at age four.

S.\n\nThis story has many adventures, and I would say everyone has heard of it, not to mention The Great Gatsby is a great book. The main characters are Gatsby, Nick, Tom, Daisy, Myrtle, and Jordan. This book goes from 1922 to 1924 and takes place in New York. This book shows love, the 1920s, and the American Dream.\n\nThe book is about a man named Gatsby who was once in the army, he then came home to America then became a very rich man. He met Daisy during the war, and then they got married. After that he wanted to find Daisy again so he came back to New York and became very rich overnight.\n\nAfter he became very wealthy, he bought a very big and extravagant mansion and moved it right next to Daisy and Tom's house. Daisy was married to Tom, and she started having an affair with Gatsby, as Gatsby wanted to have a baby with her. Tom got jealous so he went over to her house and started an argument, it all ended when Gatsby and Daisy got arrested for the murder. I love this book! 🙂\n\nMrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh\nBy O'Brien\n55 points\nBy M. W.\n\nOn the day I picked up this book I thought it looked really interesting. Once I began to read the book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh Mrs. Frisby and her husband moved to the rats of Nimh's farm to get the winter. Mrs. Frisby had 5 of her kids still at home and they needed food and warmth. Her husband told her that the farm was not doing well. So Mrs. Frisby goes and talks to Jonathan and John. Jonathan and John told her that they can do better than Mrs. Frisby and her husband that their rats have a different way of farming. Jonathan and John have some of their rats on their farm so the rats can work and they make a lot of money and they also get a lot of food to use and to survive. Jonathan and John told her that they could come help her out but that her husband would die anyway. Then Mrs. Frisby comes back home and she goes to her husband and she tells him what happened and he says he is fine with going to their farm.\n\nShe wants him to go so their children do not have to go. So she tells him and she tells her children they are gong to move. She tells them it is okay if they do not want to go because when her husband dies they can take care of themselves. Their children do not want to go but then Mrs. Frisby tells them they have to go. Jonathan and John help them move and then they all live together in a barn on their farm. Mrs. Frisby is really happy that her husband is not going to die. Mrs. Frisby and her family's lives are going to be better now that they moved. That night before they slept little Timothy said we are here now and I am not afraid. I am really happy and I want all of you to be happy.\n\nWhen his mom comes in she says it looks like they have lived there forever. In the morning everybody gets back up and when they left it was like it was never there. Mrs. Frisby goes back to check everything but she does not see anything. Then she looks around a little more and she found Jonathan and John. Jonathan and John told her they changed some stuff around like the entrance and other stuff. I like this book but I do not really like the rats much. I like the whole book. This book is about Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\nBy Rowling\n320 points\nBy M. K., A. F., M.

As it's currently written, it's hard to tell exactly what you're asking.\n\nAnswer: There is nothing to explain and the proof is an obvious consequence of the definition of \\em{integer.}\n\nAnswer: A positive integer can have the following properties:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item It is even or odd\n\\item It is a multiple of $3$ or prime\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIf $x\\geq 5$ ,  $x+3 > 4$ is impossible due to the multiple of $3$ criterion.\n\nThus $x<4$ or $x=5$, then $x+3>5$ is impossible due to the prime criterion. Since $x=5$  is impossible, then $x<4$ which is what we need to show."

        "output": "Based on the facts that have been provided, prove the following statement.\n\nStatement: \"For every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0\"\nFact: The square of any real number is non-negative.\nConclusion: In other words, for any real number, x, x^2 ≥ 0. (This fact may be stated more broadly as any number can be represented as the square of some other integer.)\n\nSince the statement and the facts used to prove it are consistent with our general understandings of the natural world, we have probable, a priori, justification for the statement.\n\n### Proof by contradiction\n\nAnother way to prove the truth of a claim is by using a proof by contradiction. Consider again the fact that, for any real number, the square of that number is non-negative. We know that that statement is true, so why would it be true?\n\nSuppose that the claim were false. In that case, for all of numbers x, the equation x^2 + (−2)x + 1 would equal x^2 − 2x + 1. This means that the statement (x^2 + (−2)x + 1 − (−2x + 1) = 0 would hold for all of the numbers\nIf you multiply that equation by 2x, you get that x = ½. However, if x = ½, then what is 1 = x-1? You have a contradiction; therefore, the claim cannot be false.\n\n### Deductive proof\n\nProof by induction is another method for proof, and one of the most common.\n\n### Deductive proof\n\nProof by induction is another method for proof, and one of the most common.\n\nInductive arguments provide justification for claims through a process of generalization. Begin by asserting that a claim is true for a certain set, {1, 2, 3}, for instance. Then extend that set to set {1, 2, 3, n}, for all numbers n where n is a positive integer, i.e. a whole number with no fractional components—like 3/2.\n\nThe claim must be consistent with other similar claims, even if the original claims are false. If the original claim is false—that the square of every rational number is a rational number—then its extention will also be false, since {1, 2, 3, n} is also false.\n\nThe same extention fails for every n. In other words, {1, 2, 3, n} is consistent with the extention of its preceding set, but it fails to extend to set {4, 5, 6, n} for any n. In other words, {1, 2, 3, n} fails to maintain its coherence with itself.\n\n## Proof by computation\n\nA computer is capable of providing a proof by computation, which is a very quick way to establish the truth of a proposition.\n\nA proof by computation is typically not sufficient to establish a proposition because it is too easy to perform a proof by computation for the wrong proposition. However, it is a useful way to quickly check your proof when you are not sure if your proof is correct or not.\n\nFor example, if you need to establish that f(x) = x² + 3x − 2 = 0 is true for all numbers x, you could use the computer to find the values of f(x) for all numbers x. If it turns out your computation confirms the assertion, then you may be sure your proof is correct.\n\nIn fact, if the proposition you are trying to establish is simply true, a computer will easily give you a proof to establish the truth of the proposition. For example, if you wanted to establish that π is an irrational number, you can simply use a computer to compute all of the decimal approximations to the decimal approximations of π, and the computer can easily verify for you that it produces an infinite number of digits.\n\nIn this example the proof by computation takes less computational time to establish the truth of the proposition than any proof method known to man.\nComputers are able to perform such proofs much more quickly than most other methods known to man.\n\n## See also\n\n* Axiomatic deduction\n* Computer-aided theorem proving\n* Deductive logic\n* Deductive mathematician\n* Discovery method\n* Disqusitivism\n* Euclid's Elements\n* Formal language (mathematics)\n* Gödel's incompleteness theorems\n* Mathematical proof\n* Non-"

[by the hypothesis]\n\nTherefore jk is odd . . . [by associativity of multiplication]\n\nLet me know if my proof is wrong.\n\nComment: Note: \"by assumption\" should be \"by assumption\" \"by associativity\" should be \"by associator\" and \"by commutativity\" should be \"by commutator\".\n\nAnswer: In fact (notice that $j$ and $k$ are \\strong{not} necessarily integers), we say that $f\\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb R)$ is a \\em{smooth} function if $j$ and $k$ are integers in the statement above. We shall see later on that any continuous function is the limit of smooth functions.\n\nLet assume that both $j$ and $k$ are odd. Then $f$ is the product of two odd numbers, i.e. $f=j\\cdot k$. Then notice that \\strong{all} the other factors are even. The result is even, in particular odd.\n\nNow let assume that both $j$ and $k$ are even (it follows directly from the preceding case, that the case $j$, $k$ odd). Then $f=j\\cdot k=2\\cdot A$ where the $A$ is an even factor. It follows that $f$ is even as well. We already show that if $f$ is an integer even number, then it's odd.\n\nThus our hypothesis is true.\n\nThis is a simple proof about numbers (they're \\strong{all} the elements of the system that we are considering now).\n\nThe previous argument should be generalized now that we consider continuous functions, but the argument should be the same.\n\nComment: I think I didn't get it. Let me write my attempt. I made my post.\n\nComment: @PedroJordão I do hope that you're using the same notation as me . . . ;)\n\nComment: @Miguel So you say that the hypothesis is always right? Is there a proof that shows that?\n\nComment: Please give an example if you want to clarify something. I can't say precisely about the example you gave, but the hypothesis is always correct for finite systems. For example, I can't say whether 0.9 multiplied by a fraction is even because 0. isn't even. But, you can always use integers in the proof that 0.9(1/5) is odd."

What I cannot understand, however, is how they get 672 for this problem. It seems like by using the formula we'd simply get 0 for the common difference. I'd greatly appreciate some help on this.\n\nEdit: To answer one of the comments, they're using a general formula for an arithmetic progression that doesn't contain any common difference in it, and then are just using this.\n\nAnswer: It does seem strange that they used a \"common difference\" to calculate the n-th term. In my opinion, they probably used a general formula for arithmetic progressions to obtain the n-th term, and then used that formula."

I'm a computer scientist!\n\nComment: Sorry, @DanielBourque, I think I didn't understand what you meant with \"You acted really crazy last night,\" because I did translate that as \"love you so much.\"\n\nComment: \"crazy\" does not necessarily have an emotional meaning.\n\nAnswer: Your logic is correct. Note also that there are no true negatives or false positives, just \\em{less true} ones.\n\nI would, however, suggest to use a decision tree rather than a table, as a table with one condition per line requires large files to have reasonable complexity.\n\n\\begin{code}\nclassifier = [\n     [ \"acted\", \"crazy\" ],\n     [ \"acted\", \"didn't\" ],\n\n]\n\\end{code}\n\nWhere \"acted\" is the word that appears in the text (a list with each element being a word).\n\nSince we are going through many \"cases\", we can make \"acted\" a list of all those cases.\n\n\\begin{code}\nclassifying_text = \"\"\nfor word in case_list:\n    classifying_text += word\n\nfor words in classifier:\n    if(classifying_text == words[0]):\n      # Classified\n      print words[1]\n      exit\n    else:\n      # Not classified\n      print words[2]\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: Thanks! Actually the classifier is actually a sentence. In this case, I don't care about the sentence and I can only work with my classifier as I have shown.\n\nAnswer: It is not an NP problem. It's trivial to generate all the strings and their possible translations. I would recommend doing that so that you can then decide whether you want to go with the string or the binary (0/1) translation of the strings.\n\nComment: The point of this exercise is to try to see if we can do this problem with less lines of code in python.\n\nHowever, I want a solution such that it includes also the problem of how different combinations of words can be transformed to a sentence such that I want my classifier to output a statement of \"not offensive OR offensive\".\n\nAnswer: Try this approach, not really sure if it works, but might work?\n\n\\begin{code}\nclassifier = [[\n\n    [ \"the\", \"sentence\", \"a\", \"classic\" ],\n    [ \"if\" ],\n    [ \"you\" ]\n]\nclassification = \"\"\nfor item in classifier:\n    result = item[0].split()\n    for key in result:\n      classification += (\".*\"+key+\".*\")\nprint classification\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: I don't think the result will be 100% correct as it will generate strings such as \"the phrase is crazy\", when it should be \"the phrase is love you and die\"\n\nAnswer: I have rewritten your program.

Pick a category from the list of News & Buzz, Travel, Style, Arts & Culture, Politics, Tech, and Science & Health.\n\nThe #Banksy Exhibit in Cambridge, MA is absolutely terrific. It is in an industrial area near the Lechmere #MBTA Station -- an area which has a very strong presence of homeless people. So, as a member of the homeless community of Boston and Cambridge, I am not going to write about this exhibit in detail as this is not my main or most appropriate audience. However, I urge some of my readers who either live here in Boston or can get to it -- to go out and see it. It is a powerful political statement by one of the world's leading and most controversial artists. And, if you have done any research about Banksy's \"art,\" be prepared for a huge surprise.\n\nComment: And I might add that the Banksy Exhibit is really the only exhibit of this type in the whole of Boston. It is very different from other museum exhibits. So, the Banksy exhibit in Cambridge is going to appeal much more to the general public -- not just to academic types or art historians. In this case, it is best not to miss out on it than to overload oneself with so much academic and political and financial \"heavy lifting\" as to be completely overwhelmed by the experience of all of these concepts at the same time. And in the case of art, there is...\n\nComment: no end to all of its different faces -- political, financial, artistic, philosophic, ethical, and religious, etc. If one just keeps digging in this one little area -- the world wide art scene -- for all the little facts, figures, ideas, and concepts that one can possibly handle, then, one will never become as adept a Banksy scholar as the great @Stan_Cox. But, I am just kidding here, you are a great Banksy scholar.\n\nAnswer: \\strong{To be \"open\" is a very broad term}\n\n\\em{I can’t tell you which of the above are correct, because I am not an expert on Banksy. I do however, think you are correct to state that he is a 'conceptual' artist.}\n\nIn the realm in which Banksy operates, there are so many different ways to explain the definition of conceptual art as it applies to his work.\n\nI would say that it is \"artwork\" that is created through the use of concepts and ideas, as opposed to tangible artistic techniques, with the purpose to initiate or generate discussion.\n\nIf we were to use this definition specifically with reference to his work, we would conclude that:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item His artistic concepts are directly based around social, cultural and economic \"contexts\" and \"issues\".\n\\item The purpose of this artistic strategy is to raise awareness (and usually, controversy) on current affairs that need to be debated on. And to provide a \"different\" perspective on such affairs.\n\\item The result is usually an artistic \"intervention\" on public/private space, which can provide an \"opportunity\" to promote critical thinking about his social/cultural/economical stance.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{With such context in mind, I would say that \"open\" is a very applicable term to Banksy's art }\n\nHere is my argument (although I am not an expert on this particular \"context\"):\n\nConsidering the above stated intentions of Banksy as a \"conceptual\" artist, the only relevant way to describe him is as somebody that goes about creating a \"discourse/conversation\" that could very easily be open, accessible or available to whoever has interest in or can be interested by what he does.\n\n\\strong{It is up to the audience to participate in the process and take it upon themselves to get involved}\n\nThe reason that these particular works can be described as open is precisely because of its nature.\n\n\\strong{Ones' ability to open up the potential and allow opportunities for others to connect to a particular idea or concept, or even to see and appreciate its importance as a \"concept\" (which is not always possible to perceive or recognize the importance of such conceptual work), is dependent upon the audience's ability to grasp and understand the work.}\n\nIn this sense, only those people that connect to the \"discourse\" that is generated might be able to see beyond the artistic work and be able to take part in"

I tried a border color as transparent but it doesn't remove the black border\n\nComment: Is the black border an issue? What do you want to see on the black border?\n\nComment: Ideally I would just like it to be transparent and make the bottom of the avocado look like the top"

Can you give some examples of this case?\n\nComment: It would simply mean that you are expected to understand the concept, so here are some examples to look at. [Wikipedia Sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average#Sampling)\n\nAnswer: Since the data contains both the high and low amounts it would be appropriate, when calculating a mean, to use an average between the high and the low (or average one way or a the other).  The mean between two numbers $a$ and $b$ should be the median.  (The median is the amount in the middle when we are splitting an amount into two equal amounts).  In your example the mean would probably be $35.83.00$.\n\nI realize that the problem asks for the \"average annual salary\".  Using \"Annual\" seems a bit suspect since they ask for \"salary\" which is specific to a year, but since they ask for what is average I have answered using mean.\n\nAnswer: Let's use the data from below. The problem statement says average annual salary, but it does not say if it is \"median annual salary\" or the \"mean annual salary\". However, since they ask for the \"average\" they probably wanted the mean of the \"data entry clerk in United States of work based company.\"\n\n$15 p/h. 8 hrs/day x 208 days x 12 years = $2 $\n$300p/w. 80$ x 2080$ = 78.25\n$82.5 p/h times 1 hrs. = $82.5 $\n$8.4$\n$9 p/h times 4 hrs = $36 $.\n$92.5$\n$8.5$\n\nThe average wage = $70.25 / (5+4+3+3) = $70.25 / 16 = $4.28$.\n\n$4.28 x 40 =$ 171.2 $\n\n$208 p/w x 4.28 = 8.5 $\n\n$40 p/h times 4.28 = 1.76 hrs = 0.25$\n\nThe overall average wage is $171.20 $ (that looks kind of funny to me)."

Attention is used by the majority of RNN-based machine translation systems to control the flow of information between the encoder and decoder. This paper proposes a new network architecture built on attention mechanisms, instead of convolutions and recurrent layers, which is simpler and more efficient during train time. We find that our network architecture, the Transformer, performs very well in terms of translation quality and training speed in the machine translation domain. We also apply the Transformer architecture to constitute a new state-of-the-art in English constituency parsing on both Penn Tree Bank and Brown 1996 and 2002 datasets with limited training data.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers, the organizers of the 2016 HLT workshop,\nthe WMT 2014, 2015 and 2016 challenges, and Google Research for making the WMT 2014, 2015 and 2016 corpus available.\nThis research did not require any experimental subjects.\n\n{\\small"

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes.\nQuestion: What is English constituency parsing?\n\nTransformer-based models have shown strong results in this task \\citep[e.g][]{Zhang:2019,Sachs:2019} and it's important to understand why their predictions are more accurate than that of other seq2seq models when it comes to parsing long sequences.\n\nWe experiment with a self-attention version of transformer and an encoder-decoder version, both followed by a CRF post-processing step. Since some of the outputs of the transformer-based model are very long, we use an additional linear projection layer to generate output length $= $500 tokens.\n\nTo train a transformer model, we create the input sequence from the POS representations from constituent level annotations and the corresponding tree-like syntactic parsing tree produced by a constituent parser \\cite{Peters:2015,Sheng:2016}. Since not all constituent annotations provide the necessary level of information to accurately parse a sentence, we remove sentence-level annotations. We then pretrain the transformer on a 50 million corpus of English text and obtain a tokenizer model, a sequence-to-sequence pretraining and finetuning model. We also pretrain the transformer on 6.5 million SICK sentences and use it to generate the sequence-to-sequence model, which we will call Transformer-SICK. \\footnote{Our pretraining and finetuning setup can be found in Appendix.}\n\nTo evaluate if our system generalizes, we obtain 10 SICK-8K development sets where the original constituency tree for each sentence was annotated with gold dependency structure. Our goal is to compare the performance of the Transformer-SICK model to the performance of a CRF-decoder model fine-tuned on the dev data. For this purpose, we use a two-stage decoding method which makes use of the predictions of the LSTM encoder to initialize the beam search process. We use beam size of 3 (the maximum output length was 195 tokens so this is reasonable) and set the minimum length at 15.\n\nWe use the standard evaluation metric of SICK of \\textit{accuracy-no-edge} and \\textit{accuracy-all-edges}, which is a percentage of correctly aligned trees that don't have any edge errors. Since we also obtain a tree in the same way as the CRF, we compute the difference between the CRF tree and the decoding tree to be able to get an evaluation of the decoding step.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig/tree_acc.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textit{Left}: The accuracy of CRF decoding after finetuning of our transformer system for three different amounts of development data, the same values as the dashed lines in Figure \\ref{fig:csts_acc}. \\textit{Right}: The difference between the CRF tree and the decoding tree. The x-axis shows the predicted length of the trees.

On the left, we plot the mean accuracy per sentence of our finetuning step. On the right, we plot the percentage of trees that both the CRF and our decoding step got correct. It is clearly easier to finetune from small datasets like SICK-5K, whereas from SICK-20K the accuracy is already comparable to the CRF. We also see that the finetuning step on the development data does not seem to significantly improve the CRF performance. It is likely that the CRF training procedure could be improved to provide better performance.\n\nWhile the CRF system requires precomputed trees for training, the transformer system was trained simultaneously in an end-to-end manner without using any labels.

As one of the core building blocks of AI, machine learning (ML) contributes to a variety of applications, e.g., speech recognition, vision recognition, recommendation systems. Nowadays, chatbots are emerging as a key paradigm of dialogue systems, which has been rapidly utilized in various scenarios \\cite{wu-etal-2020-unsupervised}. Specifically, dialogue systems receive natural language input directly from users and output a response. Since such user input can be arbitrary and complex, dialogue systems require great intelligence to understand them correctly for the proper generation of spoken response. To this end, dialogue systems can be divided into two categories: task-oriented dialogue systems and chitchat dialogue systems \\cite{gupta-etal-2020-chitchat}. Chitchat dialogue systems aim to generate responses spontaneously from users' input, while task-oriented dialogue systems are used to complete specific tasks from end-users. A major part of chitchat systems is used for information searching, e.g., restaurant recommendation. Such systems usually only use a small set of open-domain dialogues, making them susceptible to domain-shift and also hard to train. On the other hand, task-oriented systems rely heavily on specialized industrial API to perform a certain task. As the number of APIs increases, the data requirement for learning the API knowledge and the domain-shift becomes difficult to meet. To address such complex and sparse scenarios, few-shot learning (FSL) has been proposed to achieve good or even better performance in few-shot settings. FSL can be regarded as the transfer learning (TL) variant for few-shot tasks, which can also be viewed as a generalization of single-task learning (STL) \\cite{liang-etal-2018-multiple}. Due to the sparsity of data for few-shot tasks, it is common to use unsupervised methods to generate pseudo labels for few-shot tasks in FSL. Following this process, large amounts of pseudo labels can be generated from massive labeled datasets \\cite{liang-etal-2018-multiple,zhang2017learning}. Then, these pseudo labels are utilized to train few-shot tasks.\n\nDue to the limited data availability, the few-shot scenario requires that a dialogue-understanding system should have sufficient training data to learn relevant tasks. However, a fully labeled dialogue data is usually not available. In this paper, we focus on intent detection and slot filling which are two closely related tasks with a bidirectional relation. For instance, if the dialogue system is asked to find all restaurants located where a user is currently, both intents, \\textit{location} and \\textit{eating}, will be fired, however they are highly correlated. By combining the two tasks of intent detection and slot filling, we make the model focus on the correlation between intents and slots, and thus"

If not, I'd recommend to check the `emails.subject` in the body of your response.\n\nAs I see, the response is returned with the key `status`, so maybe you can try to return something else in the body (as text) like:\n\n\\begin{code}\n{\"email\":\"...\", \"status\": 1 }\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: This is the correct answer, thank you so much!

As a result, I believe that anyone who is planning on taking a trip to the theater to watch this great movie should be well informed as to its content. As an authoritative source, the movie was produced by Cameron himself, and I trust him wholeheartedly. The movie is based on a fictional planet, Pandora. The planet is inhabited by humanoids who are natives of the planet. These beastly humanoids...\nTv Shows vs. Movies\nAre Movies Good for You? Movies have always been a source of entertainment; even prior to their invention. They have captivated the minds of all generations. Whether they are educational or fiction, it doesn’t matter. People have always been interested in stories of the lives of people living in a different era. Movies present an image of the historical era and society that they are in. People have always had a hard time getting the full experience of a particular historical era, so...\nMovies Vs Books - 542 Words\n﻿Books VS Movies The process of reading vs watching movies is very important. The first reason I believe reading is so much better than watching movies is the effect it has on people and their understanding of something they are learning. Reading books involves using your imagination. Reading gives people more meaning and comprehension of what they read. While watching a movie, people only see what they are being shown. The images are usually set for a time period and the people...\nTv Shows vs Movies\nTelevision vs Movies: Which one is better? In a world where technology is being used to make life easier, some have opted to make the world a bit more beautiful. Films, television, and movies are the epitome of the phrase ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder’. From the way they are made to the way their plots are structured and executed, each one is different. Nevertheless, people have differing preferences and opinions when it comes to these two media forms, television and movies....\nMovies and Family - 608 Words\nWhat are the responsibilities of family members toward each other? Family members will have to share different responsibilities to each other, such as doing household chores, helping the younger ones with their homework, preparing simple meals and so on. It’s the responsibility of each family members to do this in order to create a sense of unity and family harmony. What happens when the family members don’t pull together?

        "output": "List the concepts that should be learned before approaching the given complex concept.\n\nDeep Learning is the new buzzword in the IT industry. It is used in AI and has resulted in major improvements, especially in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The concept is quite complex and it is extremely difficult to understand it just by reading a paragraph or two. It is generally assumed that, deep learning has resulted in the development of systems which are capable of reasoning and problem-solving. Such machines can be the future. However, it is also true that the machines may take over the human race, and we, as humans, have to do something before it is very late.\n\nA major concept in machine learning is neural networks. In neural networks, there are many layers in the network and each layer is connected to every layer. The network learns from the past data. Neural networks can be used to solve machine learning algorithms like linear algebra which is very complex. However, neural networks take a lot of time to compute. As a result, a deep learning neural network is used which is much more efficient and can result in better performance.\n\nIf we look at the definition of the concept in the picture on left, we can have a quick understanding of deep learning. It says that there are several hidden layers between the input layer and the output layer which improves the accuracy of the model. However, this is not the full concept.\n\nTo understand deep learning, let's take a look at an example on right.\n\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n& \\\\\n& \\hspace{1.1cm}\\text{input layer} \\longleftarrow \\text{Input data: x1,x2,...,xN} & \\mathcal{H}_0 \\\\\n& \\vline& \\\\\n& \\mathcal{L}_1 \\longleftarrow \\begin{aligned}\n\\ \\text{output layer} \\longleftarrow \\text{Output data: y1,y2,...,yN} \\\\ \\\n\\text{hidden layers} \\\\ \\\n\\end{aligned} \\\\\n& \\vline& \\\\\n& \\mathcal{L}_2 \\longleftarrow \\text{hidden layers} \\longleftarrow \\ \\text{output layer} \\longleftarrow \\text{Output data: y1,y2,...,yN} \\\\ \\\n\\text{hidden layers}\n\\end{array}\n\\label{equ:1}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn other words, let's first input our data and get our output. Based on our output, we can make the predictions and the conclusions in our output.\n\nIt should be noted that we are generalising here. The deep learning neural network is a multilayer and nonlinear perceptron network.\n\nThere are three different types of data used in deep learning neural networks:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n& \\mathcal{X} & \\mathcal{Y} \\\\\nX & \\longleftarrow & \\text{Input data: x1,x2,...,xN} \\\\\nY^* & \\longleftarrow & \\text{Output data: y1,y2,...,yN}\n\\end{array}\n\\label{equ:2}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n& & \\\\\n& * & \\mathcal{C} \\\\\n& & \\\\\n& * & \\mathcal{H}_0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\label{equ:3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nFrom Equation 3, we can understand that we need our neural network to learn and compute the output. We also want to know when we need our neural network to learn and compute the output because of certain events in real life. These events should be recorded and our neural network should be able to learn from it and generate the output corresponding to the event.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n& \\times & P(Y|X) = \\alpha^* \\\\\n& \\vline& \\\\\n&\\alpha^* &\\alpha = \\text{probability of occurrence} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\label{equ:4}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\section{Deep Learning with Neural Networks}\n\\label{sect:dl}\n\nDeep learning is a subfield of AI research with the principal goal to build algorithms that achieve results on par with a human's and/or that human would be unable to achieve otherwise. Such algorithms are developed in an unsupervised way and can be used by human beings in real life after a lot of testing and validation.\n\nThere are many algorithms which are used for deep"

He had his car fixed and sold for a fortune. b. His brother had\nhis car fixed and sold it for a fortune.}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: The gerund \\strong{\\em{ready}} is a participle, so you are right: it can't end the sentence. If you want to use it as an adjective, which is what you should do, you will need to use the present progressive with \\strong{\\em{like}}. The sentence will then mean that the chicken is ready for an animal like it.\n\nIn general, it is incorrect and very awkward to use participle endings. Try \"It eats the plant\"; \"It is ready to eat the plant\"; \"It was ready to eat a plant\"; \"It was ready to eat plants\". Forget about the present perfect, the gerund or any other participial ending.\n\nAnswer: You are correct: \"ready\" is an adjective (participle). Just use \"ready\" as an adjective in present tense, e.g.:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\"The chicken is ready to eat.\" = The chicken is ready to eat food now.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnswer: The sentence you are answering is simply: \"The chicken is ready to eat.\"  The participle \\em{ready} is an adjective - its form in the past tenses is \"ready \\strong{to have done} X.\"  Thus, the second sentence \"The chicken is done\" means \"The chicken is done eating.\"  But as you have noted, an adjective cannot end a sentence.\n\nAnswer: You got it right. It can not end a sentence like this."

You should use the following code:\n\n\\begin{code}\nprint \"Hello World!\\n\"\n\\end{code}\n\nUsing \\em{print} is like print and end, in this case, there is \\em{end} after \\em{print}. I don't know if you're aware of it, but is also a good practice to use the \\em{.gsub} method. This way you can make your code more readable.\n\nExample:\n\n\\begin{code}\nprint \"Hello World!\", \"\\n\"\n# print \"Hello World!       \"      , \"\\n\"\n# In this case you will have to repeat the \"Hi World!\"\n\\end{code}"

If they mean definition, that seems like it would be much easier.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhere soldier and general have been defined and have the following axioms:\n\n\\begin{code}\nsoldier(y)\ngeneral(y,z)\n\\end{code}\n\nThen, give the definition of the sentence in first-order logic.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI assume this means that you can create a sentence such as \"There is something the name of soldier whose first argument is x and second argumnt is something the name of general\" which is a well-formed sentence; this seems to mean that the sentence is just a name of a well-formed sentence. The \"translation\" should just be to change the formal grammar and change the interpretation, which you've already done with the axioms given. The second \"translation\" is just a name of a well-formed sentence, which would be\n\n\\begin{code}\n∃x∀y(general(y,x))\n\\end{code}\n\nBy well-formed sentence, I mean a sentence such as \"x > 0 and y > 0\".

As a new developer, I didn't know much about NLP and was looking forward to the answer.\n\nAnswer: You may try using `nltk` package. There is a `sentiment.analyser` to do sentiment analysis. In this example we count words and check if sentiment is positive (pos).\n\n\\begin{code}\nfrom nltk.corpus import brown\nfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\nfrom nltk.sentiment import SentimentAnalyser\n\nbrown=brown.raw()\n\n#checking words\nwords = brown.words()\n\n#analysing sentences using nltk SentimentAnalyser\nsentence_text = 'I do not like apple.

Apple is poison.\"\n['apple', 'do', 'like', 'not', 'poison']\n{'type': 'advice', 'sentiment': 0.2175256489728927, 'pos': 2, 'neg': 1, 'label': 'Advice'}\n[2.438392438392437, 1.607598711020524]\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: What package would you use to do that classification/classification\n\nComment: You can check http://nlptutorial.com. This is about general NLP. Then you can check the API of SentimentAnalyser from nltk to check sentiment analysis. I also update my answer so you can try it."

Is it common to leave off the \"ingredients\" part of the puzzle but have it in the text, at the end of the paragraph, maybe, to show the reader it's part of the problem? (Think the old riddles where the answer showed up after a few words/phrases were taken away.) Or, when you don't want the title to show up, are there other common ways to word it?\n\nAnswer: How about \\strong{guidelines}?\n\nAccording to [Cambridge Dictionaries Online](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/guidelines?q=guidelines), it can also mean \\strong{list of instructions, especially for a team or an organisation}. So, it suits well with the part of the instructions you've added.\n\nFrom \\strong{Oxford Dictionaries} [dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/guidelines](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/guidelines)\n:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nsomething (such as a list of instructions) that shows how to do, or how to be, something\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe usage of \\strong{guidelines} in this case is very common. You don't often describe the recipe as instructions. It's always a list of ingredients and maybe a few instructions. Like I've said before, it can be anything that shows how to do something. So, I'd recommend using the term."

        "output": "Provide a pleasant compliment based on the quality you have been given.\n\nTruthfulness and uprightness do not depend on whether our words are being received well by the one at whom they are aimed. We can use an honest truth in a cruel or untruthful manner -- that is a different matter. But for the sake of the truth we may be criticized harshly, and yet, it must be said, with a good purpose.\n\nNo, that can never make you a liar. And so with a pleasant compliment. The quality which it seeks to emphasize really shows that you are honest, truthworthy, upright. And so the quality of sweetness, of tact, of kindness, must accompany all genuine compliment-giving.\n\nThe Complimenter\n\nThe one who is given the good words is, of course, the recipient. He is the one to whom the compliment is directed, upon whom it is bestowed.\n\nBut just as the word, the phrase, and the thought is one with the man giving it, so the word, the phrase, and the thought is one with the man receiving it.\n\nSo I know my attitude about the word to be what my attitude about the man is, and so in the mind of the receiver of a sweet compliment the sweetness of the words will be lost. To a man of kindness the receiver of unkind words will be hurt. And to a man of kindness the words of unkindness will be unkind.\n\nThe real receiver of the sweetness is the personality. The one who sees it is the man. With him goes the thought of the sweetness. As it is in the mind, so he is. The man knows his own sweetness, knows the goodness of the good words which have been given him.\n\nThis is not the compliment -- for in receiving the gift the receiver knows the giving. This is not the sweetness -- for in receiving the gift the receiver knows the sweetness of the words. The real gift is in the man, and it is this that the one giving the word has been directed to see.\n\nA Sweet Complaint\n\nIn any matter that may come to an argument, a complaint, a discussion, a contest -- make it as sweet as you know how to do, a sweet compliment. It will save you from bitterness, from unkind words, from hardness, from untruth. Let it be a plea for the other man, a plea for the relationship, and not a plea for your own right.\n\nWhen all is said and done, when you have lost your point, when you have been given good words which you had not expected -- let them be true in your heart. And so be a witness to the loveliness of the world, as you see it.\n\nLet it be a sweet word. In the midst of strife, in the midst of turmoil, in the midst of greatness, let it be a sweet word with which you leave your neighbor.\n\nThe real sweetness will come because you are, have been, and will be in your heart a great one. But in the presence of that great one, you may have been unkind. But a word of kindness may have saved you from bitterness, and that word of kindness will go into the world, and will come back to you a thousand-fold.\n\nLet us seek to be kind in all things, and let us remember that any sweetness we bring into the world must be sweetness from our hearts. We must be ourselves the living, speaking proof of the greatness of the world when we speak.\n\nWe Must Be Comfortable\n\nThere is a wonderful comfort in making this effort to bring sweetness, to receive sweetness. There is a wonderful beauty in the way the thing comes forth.\n\nThe world around us is sweet. There is nothing sweet about the things which are harsh, which are unkind, which are evil. The sweetness is in you. It is you who have it in your heart. It was not there until you added yourself to the world.\n\nThe world has a sweetness, but it is not your world except as you have added yourself to the world of the man, the woman, the child. But when you see the sweetness, when you feel its sweetness, and when you hear its sweetness, and when you know its sweetness of the living things which are moving or which are still, why can you not believe in the sweetness of the world in which you live? Why can you not then know for yourself the sweetness of the world in which you live?\n\nThere is something beautiful about the way it comes. There is something wonderful about"

My budget is up to $100/night and I don't really care if we have to camp some nights or where we eat. My boyfriend and I have very different interests and preferences. For example, he prefers to visit small towns and I like urban areas.\n\n\\strong{Sample question:}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nHi, I'm planning a trip around the West Coast and am wondering if\n  anyone here had the best route and a place to stay that they\n  enjoyed. \\em{[Sample answer]} We went from San Diego to Los Angeles and\n  stopped at this [place in Santa Barbara][1]. We stayed in a small hotel in downtown LA in Hollywood.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI tried to come up with something and I was thinking about [this travel stack exchange post][2] but I'm looking more for a simple list in the question:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A proper route to take\n\\item Stops, must see points\n\\item Somewhere (camping, hotel, hostel) to stay the night\n\\end{itemize}\n\n[1]: http://www.staylo.com/hotel-san-fernando\n\nSome related questions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item [Where to drive for 3 days from San Fransisco Bay area to Los Angeles by March 1](https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/25780/where-to-drive-for-3-days-from-san-fransisco-bay-area-to-los-angeles-by-march)\n\\item [Driving from LA to SF, what must I see in between?](https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/20483/driving-from-la-to-sf-what-must-i-see-in-between)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: This looks like an online planning application, and seems to get the job done in a more efficient manner than posting it here on a website. It's free to use. It's based on Google Maps.\n\nhttps://www.mapswithme.com/\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDdDn.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nOnce you've got a more precise plan and route, and a destination or area with a lot to see, the next step is figuring out places to stay, and therein lays another question entirely.\n\nComment: I think Mapswithme is the right tool to use when planning. It even says \"It also has options to search for places to stay with no need for internet\"\n\nAnswer: The quick answer: Going from San Diego to Los Angeles will take you about 3 hours in normal traffic (45 mph speed limit, so ~60 mph if you're speeding). So you should allow 2 and a half days to get from San Diego to Hollywood if you plan to move around a bit.\n\nOf course, this isn't the whole answer.\n\nOn your list:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Don't assume that people with different interests will be \\em{happy} with different interests.  It's a great way for people to have really good arguments.  Your boyfriend, I'm guessing, is going to be far more pleased with an entirely different set of stops and activities.  You will probably have a better time if you compromise.\n\\item Stop by the desert outside of Palm Springs or the Salton Sea in the middle of no where if you want to avoid the crowds and see some awesome weirdness\n\\item I would make every possible effort to book the cheapest, crappiest, and most anonymous motel available in any given spot to avoid \"having to eat\" and \"having to camp\"\n\\item You should look at a map and try to make sense of it.  For example, it's pretty easy to see that the desert of southern California is a good place to go, because it's full of nothing but nothing, and you won't encounter the massive, sprawling, massive, and even more sprawling cities of the east coast until much later in the trip.

You are using this laptop to buy onlin and you'd rather have some extra thing. It would seem to me that the bundle should only take effect if you buy your laptop onlin and not offlin and then take the shipping time and extra cost out of the equation.\n\nAnswer: You should keep this information somewhere else, if it's going to be reused frequently.  Having the ability to quickly lookup this information as needed will help keep you from having to pull it off this document each time.\n\nI would definitely keep this in the documentation.  You may use a database to keep track of, and query, the data.  If the data is not going to change much, using a spreadsheet is a great option.  That way you can copy it quickly to a document you're trying to write-up.\n\nAnswer: I agree with the previous posters; you have to maintain this list somewhere, because you're going to have to reference it every time.  In addition, I would add that you should also keep the ordering system up-to-date.  There's no point in having a list that has information that's no longer valid, and the only way to keep it current is to update it.\n\nI would suggest that you have multiple \"lists\" for different products: a \"computer\" list for computers, a \"printer\" list for printers, and an \"accessories\" list for accessories.  You may not need to refer to the accessories list as often as to the computer list, but if there's a good deal on a new iPod, or some kind of accessory, that needs to show up on the list at the top too.\n\nYou could also have a \"list of lists\"; one list of computer lists and another list of printer lists - and then just refer to that master list when you need any of the lists.\n\nThe only caveat that I would add: if you have separate lists for the \"same\" product, you may have a conflict if someone who's selling one of the \"sibling\" products (e.g. Macs and iPods, both made by Apple) decides to make an offer on the other product, especially when this offer only lasts for a limited amount of time.  If the product has identical descriptions and names, you're probably OK; if not, make sure that any changes you make are obvious.\n\nComment: The \"same product\" scenario is handled very easily with SKU's and/or PN's. If both products share a common SKU/PN, then their description and names can overlap. If a computer has an iPod accessory bundle, we would just change the SKU/PNs on both products to indicate their inclusion in the bundle.\n\nComment: @Jason - What happens if a customer makes an error with the PNs/SKUs, and orders the wrong product?  Or what if the customer has multiple products, each of which is listed multiple times in the catalog, but for different products?  What good is a PN if two products have the same PN, but different descriptions and names; it might make sense for customer support, but if it goes out to the general public, how is it going to make any sense?

I suppose that the product listing could be duplicated, and the customer support person can make the call to determine whether their query is valid (easily by comparing an SKU) and to tell them which product page to navigate to in order to order the desired item?\n\nAnswer: I would only add an SKU to the product page if it is going to be used on a shipping manifest to generate a shipping label. I would have a separate SKU for any bundles so they don't change on the merchant site.\n\nIf a product is not shippable, I would not add it to the merchant store but I'd include them in the product list.\n\nAnswer: I'd only add an SKU to a product in my inventory if:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the product is shippable and/or resalable\n\\item it's going to change with the time, be it a limited-time bundle, a limited-supply bundle, a bundled sh"

        "output": "Paraphrase the given text in an academic style.\n\nLots of papers have been published on this topic. What I have found, however, is that even the most rigorous papers do not address my question and that is not surprising because there is no direct way to answer it.\n\nMy question is:\n\nCan one say something about the probability to correctly rephrase a sentence of the source?\n\nAnswer: There is a simple solution that seems obvious at first sight: get the \\em{[latent] topic model} representation of the source document, and then get the \\em{topic-matched} topic model representation of the target document. Use these representations to calculate the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) (with an [emission matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_matrix))  of the two representations.\n\nThe problem I would anticipate is that you will not be able to use the \\em{topic vectors} to get the probability of the words to appear in a sentence, as the word probability is determined by other context. One option would be to build a separate model that predicts the probabiliy of different positions (e.g. the [Hadamard product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product)) for the words of the source document, using the same parameters as the topic model.\n\nAnswer: There could be two answers:\n\n\\section{Potential approach}\n\nYou can use a very common technique in text mining of comparing the [term-frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf#Term_frequency) (TF) values of source document and its rephrasing document and the document that is the closest in term-frequency to the target document.\n\nI think this approach only works if you have the original sentence in English. Otherwise, we are comparing the rephrasing document to a sentence that might have been translated. I don't know if the term-frequency value of a translated sentence and the source sentence are comparisons that the computer can make with any real accuracy. They could be meaningfully similar, maybe, if the sentences are quite similar in the first place? Probably even less so, if the sentences in the rephrasing documents are in different language.\n\nEven with the original source document, I think that this approach is extremely low in probability if the target sentence is long. The term-frequency values just aren't that comparable for sentences that are 100 to 500 words long.\n\nBut still, from a programming perspective, this is the only potential approach I can think of.\n\nEven though I said it is a low probability approach, it is probably slightly better than a random shot at guessing. The computer might actually do a passable job of comparing the terms in the source sentence to the term-frequencies in the target sentence. The computer can make comparisons of terms, rather than rewording the source sentence.\n\nSo, you might be able to use a sentence from the rephrased document and a sentence from the source document that is similar to the source sentence in order to find the probability that the target sentence would have also been rephrased in a similar manner. It is a low probability technique, but it could be the only way of approaching the target sentence that the computer has.\n\n\\section{Other potential approaches}\n\nThe rephrased document also contains the original source sentence, in context. If its a website, it will have the page that it is on, usually. If your goal is to simply compare word frequencies from a source sentence to the rephrased sentence, then you can do that and use those statistics to predict how closely the rephrasing sentence matches the source sentence, with probability.\n\nYou can also compare the entire rephrased sentences (or the entire source sentence - it doesn't really matter, as long as the source sentences are the same length) to the source sentence and use that data to predict which terms within the source sentence can be compared to the same term in the rephrasing sentence, and the relative distances that these terms are from each other (like how many words are between them), in which case we use statistical probability methods to predict which terms are likely to be rephrased (or not, as the case may be), with the same degree of confidence as the rephrasing sentence is determined.\n\n\\section{Possible pitfall}\n\nThis is a possible pitfall of this method of determining similarity between two sentences: if you rephrase a source sentence and the document text is a small number of words (e.g"

The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game.\n\n### ESRB ratings controversy\n\nThe ESRB rating for God of War III drew some controversy. The content descriptors of \"blood and gore\" and \"fantasy violence\" drew some ire among media outlets. God of War III's cover features a decapitated head, and Kratos is decapitated at the end of the game. The game was rated \"M for Mature\" by the ESRB on March 11, 2010. \"M\" indicates that the game would be inappropriate for anyone under 17, and includes content descriptors for \"Blood and Gore\", \"Licensed Music\", and \"Fantasy Violence\".\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment began in August 2007 at Santa Monica Studio on God of War III, a continuation of the God of War and God of War II action-adventure games. God of War III introduces Kratos' son Atreus into the story and action, and offers players \"a new adventure in their beloved God of War Universe\".\n\nAfter completing God of War II, Cory Barlog, creative director, had several ideas for a third game. It was Barlog who wanted to introduce Kratos' son, Atreus, and who pushed for the use of Blu-Ray technology. With the help of a team of about 150, he started to develop the story of the third game. Barlog said that they spent their time trying to \"capture the soul of the first game, the magic of the second, and the excitement they'd be feeling for the third\". When he was finished with the story, he gave the script to Sony, and asked them if they thought the story was believable. Their response was, \"It wouldn't make any money.\" The script was then passed onto Sony Santa Monica Studio for the rest of production.\n\nThe next big challenge Barlog faced was to create the game world to match the expectations of the fans. Barlog said \"I don't think we'd just go out and pump out something like we did with God of War II to get it out the door quick.\" God of War III features a brand new world to explore. They wanted to see many new ideas and wanted an innovative game world. The team knew they could no longer use Greek mythology and they needed to move on. \"We looked at Norse mythology\", said Barlog, \"we looked at Eastern mythology, Samurai, Ninja. There are a ton of things like that that have magic elements; there are things like wizards and the undead, things like monsters. I felt like we needed something really new and fresh\". It took the team about two years to develop the world of God of War III.\n\nThe design of God of War III would be very similar to that of God of War and God of War II. The design team spent the early years of design concentrating on the visual look of the game, and once this point was reached, it became very easy for the visuals to stay consistent throughout the game. Barlog said, \"We have always wanted the ability to bring the visuals into a third-person game and make that experience as smooth as it possibly can be. But this time we wanted to push, we wanted to take that to an extreme and create a world that was beautiful and beautiful to play in at the same time.\" The world included a range of settings including forests, temples, tundra, villages, waterfalls, and wastes.\n\nThe team made sure that the characters remained true to who they really were. \"I think that we have to maintain the personality traits and the visual designs of our characters and keep them consistent. We had this idea of doing this for Kratos and Atreus, and keeping them consistent, and keeping their movement on screen fluid.\"\n\nBarlog"

The color can be used for clothes, but also as a background color.\n\nHex: #EF8560\n\n## History\n\nDesigned by Nimbus Design and first mentioned in Adobe Photoshop version 2.5 which was released in May 1998. According to Adobe, this color was the result of a \"design team meeting that got a little rambunctious\". Adobe's description reads:\n\nOur design team was in the middle of a meeting when some of the members got a little hot and bothered. As you can imagine, things got a little lively. One of the designers took out some colored pens and pencils and started sketching a bright flower that just kept getting hotter – so hot that it turned to fire!\n\nThe name of this color is not unique to Adobe, but can be found in other Adobe products, such as Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Fireworks, Adobe GoLive, and Adobe Acrobat, as well as other products, such as Serif PagePlus. Microsoft Paint also has a Firecracker-esque color.\n\nIn 2016, Nimbus Design was acquired by Adobe and in May 2017 the color was retired by Adobe in favor of \"Flamingo\". Adobe also released the new color via press release. Nimbus Design founder Jared Tarbell said \"the color’s name comes from a funny inside Adobe story, and we’ll miss the color’s spirit being made available to everyone. But Adobe has done a great job in developing the color for use within their products, and we wanted to support their efforts.\"\n\n## External links\n\n* Nimbus Design Home Page."

Where can I read the story?\n\nComment: I would imagine that you have to know that the test is about a scene from _The Matrix_ if you have seen the film and understood it. @user8092\n\nComment: The test I am trying to describe is a very recent one. See question.\n\nComment: I don't think they would just make up their own film questions.\n\nAnswer: It's the 'choose wisely' moment from \\em{The Princess Bride}.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\"Nobody has to die,\" the stranger said. \"Nobody has to suffer. There's only one thing that's going to make this better for you. It is true love. \\em{Now, I have here} this vial of Miracle \\em{Drops} that are not nearly strong enough to cure what ails you.

When Ron and Harry first take the train to Hogwarts, Ron makes a bet he will be able to pick first, out of one choice, a compartment full of deadly Dementors, a compartment full of rats, or a compartment of friendly toffee (suggested by the title of the book \"Filch's Victim\", which is a reference to one of Harry's teachers the \"Mad-Eyed\" Professor.\n\nComment: Welcome to SF&F! This doesn't seem like the right choice to me, since it's more of a trick than something that needs to be decided.

These devices are a simple way to provide your entire class with an unimpeded view of your lessons while retaining an awareness of your students. By using the document camera with your laptop you can easily turn your classroom into a multimedia teaching space. The EON Document Camera brings you closer to your lesson by allowing you to have a greater ability to engage with your students. With its unique feature of the Equipped Light you can control the illumination on your documents from the ease of your laptop. By turning on the Equipped Light you can be assured that you are providing sufficient light for all of your students within your classroom. In addition the use of the Equipped Light also allows for the prevention of shadows from your classmates being cast on your documents. The EON Document Camera also allows for an easy access to the control buttons to use its powerful built-in zoom lens to gain closer focus on your documents.\nOur Document Camera is compatible with all Windows-based computers, Macintosh and Linux systems. You can connect our product with a USB connector and get started immediately.\n\nAnswer: I think it is more a matter of a company looking at their product and saying \"people have so far only used this to do blah, what if we put these extra features in and then we can get into bizarre markets\".\n\nIt is true that some companies, due to the nature of their products, might never see a market that is bigger than itself.\n\nE.g. You can buy, if you like, a digital camera for the purpose of putting your photos on a website. Or in a newspaper, etc.\n\nBut companies like Canon et al, sell lots of cameras to people who don't have websites or a newspaper. They buy their cameras as a family-album, to record family memories and to be proud to show to friends and relatives.\n\nBut let us return to the document camera. There is one company who seems to have found a bizarre market. [Google](http://books.google.ie/books/about/The_Google_Guide_for_Business.html?id=4x3pA3ZD8WQC).\n\nComment: But then again, I would say that document cameras have a broad enough market that it can serve a variety of purposes other than presenting information.\n\nAnswer: What has changed is how you can sell the product - most document cameras would have been sold as stand-alone devices, and then a very small number of people would also have bought software to enhance their use.\n\nMicrosoft made the decision to bundle this in with their operating system (which is used on 90% of desktop computers). They must have concluded that they would sell a \\strong{lot} more software if they were able to bundle it in the Microsoft Office package that everyone is now using.\n\nIt is now Microsoft's job to sell this to people so \\strong{they} make money - they bundle it with Office, they may bundle it with another package, or they may have a special deal with one vendor to offer one of these document cameras in a package with a bundle of Microsoft products.\n\nThere is, as I say, nothing special about this product - any company would sell it if they had one, and then they could have bundled it with a package of other software the customer would already be buying.\n\nHope that helps :-), John"

I've heard from some who want her gone, but I'd rather have her just leave of her own accord (I understand if she's not). She has gotten really nasty this last week or so, and we all know it's got to have a lot to do with this last round of layoffs. I get that people are pissed off, but she's been pretty nasty to those of us who have tried for months to get answers from the company and still aren't getting them to this day.\n\nI believe the post has been removed.. or I can get a copy of it.\n\nNow, let's just put it all out there right now: What is your opinion? And please do not comment if you don't believe we should have this person as a moderator, simply because we don't agree with this issue at all!\n\nWhat do you guys think? Have you noticed something different or similar about how you've been treated compared to others?\n\nI'm just really confused by this whole thing... And I'm really really curious to know if anyone else is pissed off about all of this.\n\nComment: Why have this person moderate then?\n\nComment: We have to. She's been named the new moderator. We can try to \"de-moderate\" her of course..\n\nComment: And if there was any doubt about that.. she's deleted her Twitter account.\n\nComment: I'd say the question, rather than \"is this person being unfair to users\" to \"why have they appointed this person to moderate when users might not be able to trust them\".\n\nComment: @Andrew, that question is valid. I just felt it was important to get the user perspective of the question first.\n\nComment: \"Should she be allowed to act as a moderator when people may or may not be able to trust her?\" seems like a better title.\n\nComment: @Andrew, maybe it is. I'll let other people make that decision.. it's a valid point. :)\n\nAnswer: I actually work with the person in question and I've worked with her for years and while she does get on the soap box occasionally and uses foul language but she's never unfairly treated anyone. And she's not about to start now.\n\nShe can take flack, I give her plenty of it everyday - but when it actually gets to the point of being inauthentic and offensive, she will respond to that and take it up with people when it becomes appropriate. I'd hate to give someone the \"silent treatment\" because they stepped on my toes (for years!), but if for the wrong reasons, it will happen.\n\nBottom line - no one person is going to get a vote as to who gets a moderator role. They're the ones, collectively, that get to \"vote\" for a person to take a role within the community. My main person who I work with is in charge of community. He is the one that should get to tell you whether someone is actually a good person for that role or not. There have been so many times where he has said \"I wouldn't touch that person with a 5 foot pole\" and then the community comes to them with a big problem with that person. Then, again, they are in the same pickle. We're at a loss for what a person should and shouldn't do, and unfortunately, they do.\n\nIf the person who you would like to become a moderator is offending folks and is taking a bad position on this stuff, then it's time to make it known and I'll be right there by your side.\n\nAnswer: I'm going to jump from this question of yours to my experience with the recent changes regarding who gets to moderate and why. As you may already know, after a lengthy public debate we ended up with [Matt Mullenweg](http://www.matt.org/) as one of two mods. Matt is a fairly active member of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) who has been working with the project since it's inception. I've had several conversations with Matt via e-mail. He's a straight-up kind of guy, and it's pretty obvious that he's all about improving this community. Matt also doesn't sugarcoat anything, and he's very direct with his feedback to the community.\n\nA few months ago he got an abusive e-mail from a user who"

        "output": "For a quick and efficient office workout, suggest a short routine.\nUse exercise bands to increase stability, strength, and agility for an office workout. Precision Nutrition Coaching Precision Nutrition Coaching Precision Nutrition Coaching has no official nutrition curriculum.\nThe goal is to get the heart rate up to a brisk walking pace. If a team member starts to lag behind, that person can be encouraged to pick up the pace again.\nLying down to work at your desk, not a great idea. A recent small Australian study indicated that workers with desks that allowed them to stand did not expend any more energy standing than sitting. The American Council on Exercise ACE recommends at least standing for every hour of work.\nIf standing is not possible, consider adjustable desks which allow you to easily shift between sitting and standing. These can be relatively expensive, so consider looking in thrift stores or on the Internet Craigslist ; some are even free. Some offices even have standing desks. The average person has more than 23 hours of leisure time each week, meaning if you manage it well, you can still maintain your fitness routine.\nWorkplace Fitness - Office Fitness\nSo instead of thinking about office fitness as a chore, think of office fitness as a way to take care of your health outside of work so you can reap the benefits at work, too. When you prioritize your fitness, exercise becomes a natural lifestyle part of you.\nFor example, you might schedule in 15 minutes of walking at lunchtime every day to get your heart rate up, or go early to your office so you can tackle the treadmill, bicycle or elliptical for a few minutes before the craziness of the work-day starts.\nWhen you have to, exercise during your lunch break.\nThese days, employees are more and more conscious about leading healthier lives outside of work—and bringing that healthy state of mind into the office! Workplace wellness programs have become a common addition to corporate health plans. Fitness at Work One of the best ways to implement fitness into your work routine is to do so at work.\nYou might also consider working with a personal trainer, or joining a gym to get a workout you know you won't skip.\nA personal trainer may create a workout plan specifically for you that can be done in the office. For example, you might only have time in the morning to hit the elliptical before work, and in the evenings to go for a brisk jog near your office.\nAn office gym is also a good option and will keep you working hard even when those cold or flu bugs start to circulate.\nOffice fitness tip: It's easy to forget to make time to exercise, so plan ahead and schedule in your fitness sessions. Also, keep a record of the exercises you do to remember which ones you enjoy and work best for you.\nBetter yet, plan a lunch-time exercise session with a co-worker. Your partner might want more support than you, which is why a personal trainer is a great choice and provides you with personalized workouts as well.\nMany corporate gym memberships have some form of redemption policy, so exercise hard. The last thing you want is to lose the money you paid to join the gym.\nA few hours of exercise won't be enough to meet your fitness goals, so a mix of a variety of exercise is best! For example, you might do an hour of cardio on a treadmill or exercise bike, a strength training workout during your lunch hour, and a 30-minute walk during your commute home or run up a few floors at the office.\nAnother good option is a personal trainer to help you develop an exercise program and get a great workout to reach your health and fitness goals!\nThe personal training team of Crescendo Fitness has extensive experience in fitness and personal training with a variety of programs to suit your needs.\nIn fact, working out at lunch or after work provides you with the perfect opportunity to get outside, enjoy the workday, and stay healthy.\nThe first step to getting more exercise in your day—and to making it a lifestyle part of you—is to break down exercise as part of your already busy day. The best way to do this is to find ways you can naturally be more physically active. This can mean standing more. Standing up for one minute is great. Sitting down for one minute is a great idea.\nBeing active throughout your workday is a lot easier"

I'm not interested in making this more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nAnswer: There are a few errors, namely\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item you are initialising `predict`, which is presumably a 1 or 0, `True` or `False`, and then passing it into your `numpy.argmax` function.\n\\item I'm not sure what you gain by checking whether `predictions` is a list and not just assuming so, but that's another error. I'm not sure whether you were doing this in Python 3, or whether Python 2 would let you perform type analysis in a statement body, like the first error.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nSo, all you have to do to fix everything is `predict = np.argmax(predictions[dim])`. Note that you do not need `dim=1` -- it is just a special case of `argmax`, where `dim=1"

Note how antonyms are written, with the first letter capitalized and the second letter lower case.\n\nSynonyms are words which have almost the same meaning as the noun and the verb.\n\nThe use of italics is for words, not for letters. Here, you should italicize \"art,\" \"maestro,\" and \"svengali.\"\n\nThe spelled-out words at the end are for verbs. The second \"m\" is lower case because it is just a part of the verb; not the whole word, which you may wish to capitalize. You might wish to add \"the artist\" with or without \"the\" and \"the\" with or without \"that.\"\n\nIf you wish, you may write more antonyms and more synonyms. The use of multiple antonyms and synonyms shows your understanding of words and of how they work.\n\n\\newpage\n\\section{A Word List}\n\nWords for a noun can change their meaning depending on what other words are near them. For example, \"dog\" can be a verb (to dig) or also a noun (a hound), but never both. We know a lot about words because of prefixes, suffixes, roots, etc. For example, \"nano\" means \"microscopic\" and comes from the Greek \"nanos\" which means \"little.\"\n\nHere, you can write the antonym and synonyms of  \\textbf{art},  \\textbf{maestro}, and  \\textbf{svengali}.\n\n\\newpage\n\\newpage\n\\newpage\n\\subsection{An Antonym}\n\nA word's antonym is another word which means exactly the opposite.

Take \"18 is less than 20\" as example. To know that, you should understand the logic of this comparison.\n\nFrom the \"18 is less than 20\", we know that 18 is less than 20;\n\nIn C, this logic is,\n\n\\begin{code}\nif (18 < 20) {\n    printf (\"18 is less than 20\");\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThus, \"18 is less than 20\" is not correct.\n\nIn fact,\n\n\\begin{code}\nif (18 < 20) {\n    printf (\"18 is less than 20\");\n} else if (18 < 20) { // here, the code after else if will not run\n    printf (\"18 is less than 20\"); // error, \"else if\" should be \"else\", thus, 18 is not less than 20.\n} else {\n    printf (\"18 is less than 20\"); // error, \"else\" should be \"switch\", so 18 is less than 20.\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nActually, the logic is \"if 18 is less than 20, then print (18 is less than 20) else if 20 is less than 18, then print (20 is less than 18).\"\n\nAnswer: Your code does not compile. You never compare a value you got from a non-integer number to the value you checked at the beginning. And there is no `else if` for 20=18.\n\nThese are the possible errors that might make your code not work, or give incorrect results:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item You might compare a non-integer number to 20. I do not know what language this code is written in, but the usual way to work with strings is to compare them with strings. In C++, this is:\n\n\\begin{code}\nif ( strcmp(a_string,\"20\") < 0 )\n\\end{code}\n\nWhen comparing a non-integer, for C/C++ there is an special operator `<`:\n\n\\begin{code}\nif ( a_int_value < b_int_value )\n\\end{code}\n\nThat is a different problem than the one you have at the beginning: you forgot a comparison to 18.\n\\item You might compare a non-integer number to 18: `if (20 != 18)`\n\\item You might forget to test 20 is less than 18: `if (20 < 18)`\n\\item You might have forgotten to test `if ( 18 == 18 )`.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThere are other possible errors. Here is a suggestion for your implementation using C++. I will leave the comments in the code (I won't delete any of them):\n\n\\begin{code}\n/*\n  * @Date    : 15-10-2021\n  * @Version : 1.0\n  * @Author  : Ahmed Gamil\n  * @Website : https://stackoverflow.com/users/951155\n  */\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Print error message\nvoid message( const std::string & error )\n{\n  cerr << error << \": \" << endl;\n}\n\n// Test if the given numbers match\nbool do_test( const int & val_1, const int & val_2 )\n{\n  return ( false != (val_1 == val_2) );\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n  // Test 18 is not less than 20\n  bool not_18_is_less_than_20 = do_test( 18, 20 );\n  if ( not_18_is_less_than_20 )\n  {\n    message( \"18 is less than 20\" );\n  }\n\n  // Test if 18"

This allows the student to have a good visual of the story and the vocabulary words.\n\nIf the student does not understand a word and it seems like the teacher must keep going without checking for understanding, try having the student turn the page and read the word she was unsure of herself. If she didn't understand it or had misconceptions about the word, the teacher knows she needs to address it more when discussing it. (This would also be a good place to teach self monitor/self assess.)\n\nIf a student is reading the book independently, I would have him use the dictionary and read the glossary definition so he has a good enough idea of what the word means and can use it in conversations with others. If he didn't understand the actual concept of the word, I would make sure he understood the conceptual meaning of the context in the story.\n\nI believe it's good to get started reading a book with students and have them stop where you know they really understand. This allows for the student to stay engaged in the story even when the teacher needs to check for understanding. Also if they don't understand a concept you can go back again or provide additional context as you move along.\n\nAnswer: There are many, many different ways to teach kids reading. So it's hard to provide specific advice for one person.\n\nWhat I would suggest is to have a chat with your teacher about which are her preferred methods and then figure out which of these methods is best for you. If you have a chat, the teacher will understand what you are hoping to do and will be able to provide advice tailored specifically to you.\n\nAnswer: This depends on how your teacher defines an \\em{academic vocabulary}, how you are comfortable learning and how quickly you need to become an independent reader.\n\nI don't believe you need a full understanding of a word's meaning to start reading it. This could even be a challenge, considering you don't have prior knowledge on what is \\em{academic vocabulary}.\n\nOn the other hand, I would argue against you being too relaxed and not taking your reading as seriously. The moment you do that, your teacher and your school system might get a little concerned. You might need to have a conversation with your teacher about the balance.\n\nAnswer: There are five types of words that are necessary when learning to read. These words are phonic (sounding) words, sight words, high frequency words, low frequency words, and \"academic\" or \"complex\" words. While some schools are quick to teach their students words in groups (i.e. phonic words, sight words, high frequency words), others go on to teach words by grouping them into types (sight words are taught and then later other types of words).\n\nKnowing this will help a teacher decide the approach. For instance, if a teacher decides to teach all of the words by type, they would start at the beginning of the year with teaching all phonic words (sounding words). Next up would be all sight words. After all of the sounding words and all of the sight words, another approach would be to divide words into four groups, one group of phonic words, one group of sounding words, one group of high frequency words, and one group of low frequency words.\n\nThen, the teacher would use a method of learning with his/her students. This method can be one of three methods, a phonic method (sounding words), a sight word method (any high frequency words), or a combination of the two. This would also take the word groups into account. The teaching method should take a teacher's background into account. The teaching method should take the student's background into account (i.e. what is known, prior knowledge, and skills). Lastly, the teaching method should take the goal for learning the words into account."

Enjoy the hot tub, basketball court, treehouse, kids rooms, bbq, fire-pit, outdoor theater, and more. One hour from Tahoe and 10 minutes to town, you’re never short of things to explore.\n\n— The Chalet by the Ridge’s Airbnb Page\n\nAlthough this description has more than 1,000 words, including some unique information, it still only provides a brief description for a property, much less one that is nearly 3,000 square feet (279 m²) in size. In particular, the owner of this particular property does not follow the standard conventions for providing Airbnb descriptions. Most properties do not offer the address or information about the location, and instead include the street address of the property in the description. The Airbnb owner also did not utilize the standard template for the \"About this space\" section, so instead of offering information about the space, property, and amenities specific to the unique offerings of the property such as outdoor activities, nearby attractions, amenities provided, etc., the owner just posted another lengthy description of the property such as the one that is posted above. The owner never refers to any of the particular aspects of the property that distinguish it from other properties on the market, so the description is more applicable to every other vacation rental than it is to The Chalet by the Ridge.\n\n#### Airbnb-listed properties without a property page (2013)\n\nOn June 8, 2013, Airbnb announced 21 properties that they will list on the site and advertise on their social networks, without requiring the properties to create a listing page or even upload a picture of themselves. In the original announcement, it was explained that Airbnb will be showing advertisements to Facebook users for these Airbnb-listed properties, in addition to the Facebook users' existing lists of Facebook friends and their own Facebook pages. The properties were chosen by Airbnb as it believed that the properties will appeal to the Facebook users, and so will hopefully improve adoption rates of the social features of the site. \nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky wrote in a blog post that the company is \"thrilled to be featured in some of these [Facebook users'] top 10 feeds...This is exactly the type of impact we want to make. We are working hard to be the company people turn to when they are ready to travel by using and learning from our network. Now that we have built a robust platform, that gives a voice to both people who like to travel or share their own homes to travelers, it’s time to start building that community. We can’t do it without your help.\"\n\nAlthough Airbnb has already launched multiple promotional plans, these latest developments were the company's first move to directly list properties in an official manner that does not require the homeowners to actually post their properties on the site. The Airbnb-listed properties will not take up a property slots on the home page, as they will be shown in the \"Featured Homes\" tab, which is separated from the \"Featured Experiences\" tab.\n\nThe 21 properties are also not yet required to pay listing fees to Airbnb, so the company will only be making a small amount of revenue from this advertising deal for a small portion of the properties on the site.\n\n#### Listing page redesign\n\nIn a major design overhaul on July 30, 2014, Airbnb updated the appearance of listing page from its first page in 2009 by changing the background color, adding a sidebar to the right side of the listing page, and removing most of the content from the middle of the listing page that was previously there to accommodate an increasing number of listing, such as the date, price, and amenities sections, which had previously stretched across 3-4 lines.\n\nMost notable changes are the appearance of the property background picture in the middle of the page, the \"Contact Host\" button, and the \"Reviews\" button that was redesigned to make all of the reviews that were previously scattered at the bottom of the listing page as a vertical list. The listing page is now composed of 2 main sections: the right sidebar section and the"

The group can be made up of current employees, or former employees, or customers. The group might even include friends and family. If you have to drive to the challenge location, and take your mountain bike, or if it is raining, or if you are late for an appointment, we all can relate. This simple challenge can be a bonding exercise to get your people moving, laughing together, or taking personal risks as they are pushing themselves toward their personal best. 10 Tips for Implementation Success! 1. It really works! Every time I have used this approach, and I'll admit this in the 9th year, this approach always produces results: people move more. So this is a simple and effective approach. 2. It is easy: no logistical problems for your team. 3. Leadership is seen in action, showing concern for the health and well-being of their team. 4. Get everyone moving. Some might think this is ridiculous, but if your people are sitting all day at their desks just get up and walk. 5. A great icebreaker to get people laughing together. 6. Brings everyone together. 7. A shared sense of accomplishment. 8. It is empowering on people. 9. Provides a team experience that is healthy, fun, and can be a bonding experience. 10. It can be done inside or outside, whatever your situation, or weather, or schedule. It doesn't require a lot of logistic effort or a schedule for those in charge. 11. It promotes employee ownership. 12. It creates excitement on days when people might not be in a particularly positive mood. 13. There is a lot of research on this approach. You can read the research and articles and studies yourself on the Strava website www.strava.com. 14. A good idea can spread quickly. 15. You will like this approach because it is simple. 16. It is fun. 17. It takes a little bit of time. 18. Everyone can do something about this. Not just leadership, but everyone can be involved in this approach. 19. Leadership can use this approach to show that they care about the health and welfare of everyone. 20. It works. You can read hundreds of posts on www.strava.com on personal stories of people who have used this approach and the results they achieved. One example: I tried to log into my Strava account. A screen came up that said, \"Your password has been changed. New password is required\" I did my password reset and re-entered my password but then I got a new password via e-mail I tried that also but it didn't work. So I went in again and changed my password I got new e-mail saying new password... I did that I tried again... nothing I went in again I changed the password again I tried it again. Nothing happened. Then I thought of a new thing to try. I changed my email address to something different and I tried that it worked!! I'm so confused.\" Then in the comments someone said, \"You might want to reset your password too and re-enter it.\" That worked. WOW! I cannot believe how many hours I lost, but it was great when I did my eighth hour and finally it did work. I'm sure everyone has great stories like this that will confirm its benefits. I used to write the stories in the comment section on this approach and I'll try to write some of them on another post too. 21. It costs nothing. 22. It is effective. 23. This approach is easy to implement. 24. It works! 25. It can be done on any scale from a small group to a very large group. 26. It can be done anywhere. 27. We can learn from it and adapt it to our context. 28. It is fun! 29 The approach can be adapted for any culture or any context (workplace health etc.) 30 All individuals should participate. Individuals should not be allowed to opt out. 31. The people who you are trying to motivate might be skeptical or cynical of this approach. Explain the benefits you are experiencing by trying this approach. It will be helpful for them to hear it from you. 32. If you do this, just do it. DO NOT PRETEND YOU ARE TRYING THIS.

Although you may have many commitments at this point in your life, it is important to remember that your schoolwork should come first.\nTry to develop the essential time management skills that will enable you to be successful in college: Organize in-class activities.\nPrior to arriving in class, check that you have all of the supplies you will need that day, including a pen, and that you have completed all of the reading assignments. In order to develop important study habits, consider the following suggestions: If possible, develop a study area that is free from distractions with comfortable seating that is well-lit.\nCollege life can often be hectic, causing you to work longer hours and to neglect your health. You should take the time to eat proper, nutritious meals, and to get enough sleep.\nThis is also a good time to begin or continue an exercise program. Eat healthy meals. Try to eat balanced meals with plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Although your schedule may be very busy, do not fall into the temptation of overeating to maintain your energy throughout the day. Avoid fast food meals.\nInstead, enjoy smaller, more nutritious meals. Eat when you are hungry, and do not skip meals. When you do not get enough food, your energy levels will drop at the wrong time in the day, making concentrating on your schoolwork more difficult. Focus on drinking plenty of water. Although coffee is often thought to be good for you, too much caffeine can interfere with your sleep, and lead to a variety of other health problems. Try to eat a small snack, such as a piece of fruit, every two or three hours to keep your energy level consistent.\nThis will minimize the negative effects and keep you alert and focused throughout the day.

        "instruction": "What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?",
        "output": "What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages? It all depends on the kind of application you want to create. For large-scale applications like games, web servers, and desktop apps, you should code in Java or Python; for smaller projects like blogs, web pages, or even simple web apps, you should code in JavaScript or Python. Both of them are object-oriented languages, and many JavaScript codes are converted to Python. It's worth mentioning that JavaScript is a better language for front-end developers, but Java and Python are better for back-end developers. What are the differences between JavaScript and Python? JavaScript and Python are two extremely popular programming languages. These languages are used for different purposes for two separate groups of developers; the front-end and the back- end developers. As most of the web applications are back-end, Java and Python are heavily used for developing back-end applications. However, most of the web applications are front-end so JavaScript is used much more extensively by front-end developers. However, JavaScript is a single-threaded language whereas Python is a multi-threaded language. Hence, Python has some edge over JavaScript in terms of performance. Python is an object-oriented language whereas JavaScript is an imperative language. However, JavaScript is more close to C language hence, it has most of the C syntax. There is a huge difference between Python and JavaScript in terms of readability. Readibility plays a significant role in any programming language. Python is relatively much more readable than JavaScript. Hence, developing a project in Python is much easy from programming view-point than developing in JavaScript. Also, Python is a more mature language than JavaScript, so there are various libraries provided for developing Python projects. JavaScript has only few built-in tools for developing projects. How do you compare Python vs JavaScript? Java can be used for developing desktop applications like Excel, word etc, as well as web applications and mobile applications. Java is an obect oriented language, like Python which is similar and can be used for back-end as well as front-end development. The syntax of Python and Java is also vry simillar. Both can be used for writing small applications as well as large application. Both are very powerful languages. I prefer to use Python, Java, C+ because I am more comfortable with them. But I am more familer with C#, because of the project that I am working in, I need to use it often. And with the same project I am also familiar with Java, because often we are required to create a mobile application, so both C# and Java are very important to me. Both languages are very good as far as the object oriented paradigm and powerful as well. Although its my opinion C has better syntax among all three of them, its not a very high-level language. I also prefer C++ in terms of speed, as it has better ability optimization for speed than C or Java. What if you're looking for the best data science certification? Try Simplilearn's Data Science Certification (44 Cours). What is the difference between Python and JavaScript? There are many programmers who know the Java and Python and are unable to distinguish which is better in which context. However, for developing applications, they choose Java and its library over Python or Python library. There are many programmers who are just interested in learning languages and don't have any specific applications to learn. There are many programmers who are interested in developing applications for mobiles than desktop systems, as well as interested in developing applications for internet browsers as well as games. Both languages, Python and Java, are popular languages used by programmers. Java is a popular choice for back- end developers who are developing large applications whereas Python is a popular choice for front-end for web pages and applications. These languages share a common code base and both are known for its simplicity and elegance. Also, it reduces the coding time which is important while developing a application in a limited time duration. Python is known as a very easy to learn and to understand language where a programmer can learn it in a short time duration. However, Java being much more complex than Python demands longer time to learn and understand the language. Java is known to have features which are not found in Python which are used less often. Hence, both Java and Python are used by programmers according to their applications. For developing desktop applications, games and mobile applications, it is preferable to use Java. For simpler web pages, web applications, or simpler applications which require only less coding, programmers in general prefer Python. However, some web application developers prefer to use Java as well in web projects. The main difference which is important between these two languages is that Java is very good because of its security features which cannot be found in Python. If developers are developing an application for mobile applications and if they want to use all security features provided by Java, then they should"

        "output": "Can you explain the basics of quantum computing? What makes a 200-qubit quantum computer special and how did you build yours? Can you explain how these special qubits are connected into the quantum computer? What does it mean when a Quantum Computer executes a Quantum Algorithm? How would it look in a practical scenario?\n\nAnswer: One of the main things you might be wondering is how these qubits fit into a computer; in other words, how a quantum computer program is loaded onto a classical computer. Generally, the simplest way to do this is to send an electronic mail from one classical computer to another, and hope that the message is correctly encoded to a stream of quantum qubits sent from the receiver to a quantum processor.\n\nMost of the time, the sender actually writes a normal computer program; this has a normal computer algorithm, as though the computer was working exactly like a classical computer. In this program, the computer is directed to send the classical message to a second electronic mail account, which is really the address of the second classical computer. After a certain time, a process on the receiving computer detects that the message has arrived, and sends it down to a hardware box which actually runs the quantum computer. There are two different ways to store this message; the first is to send it down to memory chips on the computer which, like the memory on a desktop computer, act as a storage facility. The second, and much more powerful and convenient way, is to run it through a hardware device called a Quantum Data Bus. I won't explain more about that than what I have; it's somewhat complicated, and it's not exactly easy (or even possible, really) to see how a quantum computer works while actually running on a classical computer.\n\nNow there's a slight technical point here, but it's actually probably the most important point, so in hopes of this thread living forever, I'm writing about it. Classical computers have a fixed number of memory chips (for example, 8GB on my computer), and after 8GB it's impossible to store any more information (no matter how big that information is). Quantum Computers, however, have an extremely large number of storage chips to work with; most commonly, a 200-qubit machine will have over 1600 storage chips dedicated to the qubits, and some machines have even more. However, if you can't store the message, then it will not be processed by the quantum computer. Therefore, quantum computers need a way to \"store\" a given amount of information so that it can be retrieved once the machine is ready to run. The solution to this problem is to use a quantum data bus.\n\nA quantum data bus provides a large network of superconducting lines (similar to a phone line) which can be used to send the message. However, most computers don't have this kind of line in them; after all, a phone line has a fixed amount of information it can send (and receiving) over the line, and you don't need one for each computer. So this bus is actually controlled remotely, from the second machine; it has software which sets up the lines, sends messages over them, and disconnects them. By using this method, the second classical machine can send the message, and only uses a small line between the first computer and the data bus - most importantly, however, all of this happens outside of the machine.\n\nAs a final note, the most commonly requested use of a quantum computer is actually to send an e-mail. I know this is a surprisingly common task, but a lot of people want to send an e-mail to Bill, who is actually a lot farther away than he looks, and would like to send him an e-mail on the quantum computer. Now, the sending of the e-mail is a relatively simple matter, and it's easy to encode the e-mail message as one stream of qubits which are sent down to the second machine; actually, since a quantum message is sent as one stream of qubits, sending Bill an e-mail is really sending two: the e-mail and the message, \"Would you like a message?\", both of which will be encoded on the qubits in a single stream. (And a warning is in order for the second classical machine; since you're going to be sending a ton of bits and qubits to a machine which only has 512 or so quantum bits, you might want to test out the message with the \"would you like a message?\" test to see how much error your machine will make in processing it!)\n\nComment: Thanks a bunch, I will read the answer again when I have time to digest it and hopefully ask more questions if I am unsure.\n\nComment: Don"

It is about how to develop more effective team players. We will look at some best practices in leading and managing a high-performance team. Managers and supervisors need to know how to manage their time if they’re to stay on top of all that needs to get done, manage their people, handle all the paperwork, and still take care of their personal life – all efficiently and productively.\nIf you’ve got tasks to complete you, either as a standalone manager or as part of a team, you’ve got to learn how to prioritise your work. The ability to prioritise your time and work is essential to being able to get everything done and do it well.\nSure, some things have to happen to ensure the business’s continued existence and profitability. But, some tasks are less pressing than others – often, you can push them down your ‘to do’ list while working on those tasks that are more important. Managing a project is about managing resources – specifically, the people who will be dedicated to making the project a success.\nA good project manager knows how to get the best out of the people they lead. Effective project management calls for good people skills and time management skills. As a manager, you need to understand how to motivate your team, delegate tasks efficiently, and monitor their progress towards meeting project deadlines. And, of course, you’ll need to be able to negotiate with other project managers, your customers, and even, your subordinates.\nYou may lead people who report to you, or you may not manage people at all. But, you will still need to manage tasks and projects, keep abreast of what’s going on throughout the organisation, and deal with the paperwork.\nA good manager can manage effectively in the face of a tight deadline, unexpected problems, and sudden new demands – and they can make good decisions about how to prioritise the work and tasks that need to be done.\nProject management skills.

        "output": "What are the major challenges faced by the education sector today? In 2012, UNESCO launched a new Education Strategy (2012-2021), with its slogan of “Equitable quality education and lifelong learning to empower all”. Its overarching goal is to support its Member States in meeting the education MDGs, with the ambition of creating learning communities across generations. It aims to: strengthen educational policies and systems; improve learning outcomes; promote equity and gender equality; and foster knowledge sharing and intercultural understanding. The Education Sector Strategic Plan 2013-2020 aims to achieve this by: increasing and improving opportunities to learn; addressing equity and access to education; improving the quality of learning; developing the capacity of the education sector for results; supporting and enhancing education management at all levels; and strengthening the education, scientific and cultural interchange. It is the fifth education Strategy adopted by UNESCO since 1948, and is designed to help the Organization to improve the achievements of the Education For All (EFA) movement since 2000. Over the last decade, UNESCO has worked with Member States to ensure that the EFA movement translates into concrete impact on basic education, in particular, in terms of access and increasing levels of learning. Education policies and systems have been strengthened nationally and internationally in a broad range of topics: from early childhood education to teacher education and special needs education; from school infrastructure to the design and implementation of educational monitoring systems; and from the professional development of teachers and managers to the integration of ICT. Recognising the need to promote equitable quality education and empower all to make informed decisions throughout their lives, UNESCO launched in 2012 the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) to support its Member States and partners to reach UNESCO’s Education for All-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Global Goals on Sustainable Development, including SDG 4, “Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. It aims to: raise global awareness about the need for education to play a central role in sustainable development; promote national policies and global partnerships to mobilise resources towards education for sustainable development; support teachers, parents, students, educators, and local communities to promote education for sustainable development; and provide evidence and facilitate knowledge sharing on innovative and effective ways to promote education for sustainable development. It is the first action programme on education for sustainable development at global level involving all UNESCO Member States (about 192) and all international partners. The Global Action Programme (GAP) will be implemented over a period of four years (2013-2017). It will be based on three pillars and four strategic actions. UNESCO GAP will be implemented in four steps: • • • Initiative phase: Preparatory phase; GAP launching and first four years. Implementation phase: (2017-2021) Monitoring and evaluation phase: (2018-2022) Conclusion phase: (2020-2022). Source: UNESCO Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development. UNESCO GAP will focus on achieving the following four strategic priorities: Developing knowledge, evidence and tools on education for sustainable development (ESD) and sharing best practices, innovations and challenges; Promoting integrated approaches and transformative education in order to mainstream education for sustainable development; Promoting global governance on education for sustainable development; and Reinforcing and strengthening capacity development at all levels to implement education for sustainable development. UNESCO GAP will focus in four specific strategies: Educator development; Education for sustainable development in formal education; Education for sustainable development in non-formal education; and Education for sustainable development as an issue of policy. UNESCO GAP will focus on the following global challenges: Increasing access to quality education and reducing the number of outof-school children, particularly those in vulnerable situations, including children; Gender equity in education, particularly in non-formal and technical education; Empowering education communities, in particular teachers, parents and students, to become active agents of changes; Ensuring the relevance of education for sustainable development; and Taking action to protect the environment and use natural resources sustainably.

(3 pts) Potential Implications of Single-Use Plastics on the Environment It is extremely expensive to use a plastic bottle rather than a reusable one. The single-use plastic bottle is one of the most expensive of all single-use plastic items that we purchase. Because the plastic bottle is so expensive, many people do their part in helping to keep the environment clean by saving up their single-use plastic water bottles, refilling them when they need, and taking them back to the store. When you recycle a plastic water bottle and reuse that same water bottle to avoid the plastic, you are keeping that one piece of plastic from being thrown away. Plastic recycling is a bit easier than glass or metal recycling (which can be used in different ways) because plastic only needs to be melted down and processed before it becomes part of a new piece of plastic. The environmental impacts of using single-use plastic bottles could be significantly reduced if people used the appropriate type of bottle/containers and then properly disposed of or recycled these bottles when they weren t in use. In addition, if people were more conscientious in not dropping plastic items into the ocean and in not walking out of stores with bottles in hand, then this would have an even greater benefit in helping the 21\n22 environment. This would be a good way for people to be more environmentally conscientious with a simple change in their habits by disposing of their plastic items properly.

This would be a good way for people to be more environmentally conscientious with a simple change in their habits by disposing of their plastic items properly. Potential Implications of Single-Use Plastics on Human Health To begin with, plastic (and other environmental) sources have been associated with increased incidence of cancer, a variety of endocrine disruptors present in plastic leach into food, and hormone-disrupting chemicals in plastic toxics can cause problems with neurological development, including behavioral disorders (which can last through adulthood), reproductive health, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, plastics and other environmental sources have been associated with increased incidents of cancer, a variety of endocrine disruptors present in plastic (leach through the plastic) into food, and hormone-disrupting chemicals in plastic toxics can cause problems with neurological development, including behavioral disorders (which can last through adulthood), reproductive health and cardiovascular disease. It is also important to note that plastic itself is not the harmful chemical, but the plastic leached from food containers or plastic toxins that enter the food supply through meat and fish will make people sick. The health effects include changes in reproduction and development, immune function, endocrine or hormone function, and changes in the DNA, which can be passed on to future generations. The health effects that people have experienced who work in these factories also include problems with their skin, lungs, and nose, and in general this is a pretty dirty industry to be involved in (Finkel, 2007). The plastics industry spans a global range which includes North America, South America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. The plastic and resin (which is made up of a portion of plastic) industry in North America has a total value of $43.9 billion in 2010 which accounted for more than 18% of the total plastic and resin product value. (Finkel, 2007) In 2008, Americans purchased more than 33.6 billion pounds of plastic of which more than 80% was recycled or reused. 185\n23 What are the reasons that you think people are not inclined in the United States and other countries to use reusable bottles over single-use bottles?

You will create a public transportation system strategic plan that includes analysis of both external and internal environmental conditions. External factors would include the physical aspects of the transportation systems and the political and organizational factors related to transportation and its impact on the community. The study would include the following factors: • • • • • Public infrastructure including parking and roadways Accessibility of the public transportation system such as the bus stop, bus seats, and hand holds Accessibility of all transportation related facilities within the system including security and the safety of the facility Employment policies such as providing transportation as part of the employment package and job transportation assistance Cultural and religious diversity The environment External conditions include any factors in the environment of the transportation system and would include the following: • • Traffic and pedestrian conditions and behavior Economic conditions such as affordability of the service and commuting cost Internal factors that you will discuss within your plan include both the physical elements of the system and the policies and procedures associated with the public transportation system. These factors and elements would include the following: • • • • • • • • Public transportation policies for management of the system including scheduling policies Safety standards Security standards for passengers and employees Hygiene and sanitation Condition of the buses and rail system Rules and regulations for users Service access such as policies governing passengers with special needs and ADA compliance Security policies and procedures for maintaining order and preventing vandalism and/or theft of property Public transportation policies for managing customers such as providing customer service and promoting good customer relations Public transportation policies for managing assets such as maintaining buses and rail systems and keeping vehicles, tracks, and rail lines in good condition Risk management policies such as handling any potential legal risks Public transportation policies for managing resources such as purchasing and procurement policies and procedures Public transportation policy for managing facilities including the bus stop and parking lot Public transportation policy for managing employees including recruitment and selection, hiring and training, and performance appraisal Public transportation policy for managing maintenance and repair including facilities and equipment maintenance and track and rail line maintenance and repair Public transportation policy for managing operations and maintenance including scheduling, maintenance and operation of vehicles and other equipment, and schedules for rail line maintenance and repair Public transportation policy for managing operations and maintenance including maintenance of facilities and equipment Public transportation policy for managing public relations including promotion and advertising Public transportation policy for managing safety such as providing a safe environment for users and passengers and for managing safety on the transportation system such as preventing crime, injury, and illness. When designing your public bus system plan, you should focus on the following: • Inclusion of all people who use the system such as meeting the special needs of users with disabilities and senior users, and providing an environment that is welcoming to all users. You can include information about how you would do this for your bus system. Provide information about how you would include special and/or senior users without making the system unfriendly to younger users and without compromising safety and security so that all users feel safe and can remain included and connected. You should also make appropriate modifications to the system so that customers with certain disabilities and senior users feel comfortable. You may also include the bus fleet and where you would obtain the buses as well as any modifications that would be necessary to facilitate passenger use, so that all users would feel comfortable and included. You may also include the parking lot which you would design and where you would locate the lot for your system. • Inclusion of ADA Accessibility such as including ADA-compliant buses and facilities and making necessary modifications. Such modifications may include purchasing additional buses, making facilities accessible, and making modifications that would keep the system safe and accessible. Within your plan, you should focus on ADA compliancy. Such compliancy may include buying more buses to keep buses available for customers, making necessary changes to keep all customers included and safe, and designing parking areas and facilities to make them accessible for all people. • • • Public transportation policy for managing passengers such as providing customer service and promoting good customer relations Passenger polices that include providing a safe environment for passengers Public transportation policy for managing resources such as transporting goods Public transportation policy for managing facilities such as buying more land and obtaining financing to develop additional facilities to make your system more functional.

How can a government utilize fiscal policy to combat the effects of inflation? 5.\nHow can a government utilize fiscal policy to combat the effects of inflation?\nFiscal policy is that which is used in an attempt to combat the effects of inflation while also balancing the budget. Inflation can be directly dealt with by cutting spending, increasing the money supply or a combination of both.\nCutting spending is typically recommended by economists, since increasing revenues can also be done, and there are no tax increases with spending cuts. If spending cuts are not done or if they do not prove sufficient, increased revenues can be introduced. Increased revenues could be achieved by raising taxes, so this is typically not recommended either. These types of policies are rarely used to counteract the effects of inflation since they are not beneficial for the majority of the population.

The U.S. industrial and manufacturing sectors have not experienced the same downsizing that the economy as a whole has. This is because of the high degree of technological innovation that has occurred over the years.

It also has a strong impact on what we are and how live. Language is the expression of the thoughts the minds of the people. A person’s ability to communicate is his tool in dealing with others. In order for the person to successfully make his message understood to others, he must have a grasp of the language’s grammar.

First of all, governments in other countries are giving higher importance to the students’ educational needs. Therefore, government try to give the best facilities to students in these cases such as: good standard of education, modern facilities and qualified teachers.

Data, big data, are changing everything. In fact, at least according to what researchers are saying, you may not be able to understand anything about infectious disease without understanding big data.\n18:29 Sharon Camp: The challenges created by big data also force the public health to develop the skills necessary to explore and understand it. This requires public health not only to understand the nuances of the available data sources, but also to learn and create additional novel data sources. We need to understand how the data are produced-- and what those data may reveal-- and then we need the skills and the confidence to make use of that information and apply it in ways that benefit the public.\n19:34 Sharon Camp: Understanding the challenges, and also the opportunities, inherent in the use of big data and in the integration of data and data-generating processes within the public health is a crucial skill, one that must be part of any workforce development efforts in the public health.\n20:59 Sharon Camp: One of the reasons I believe so strongly in the concept of data-driven decision making in infectious disease, particularly now with the rapid and transformative changes on the horizon, is that it is the critical component that will allow public health to rise to an increasing degree of complexity and sophistication.\n21:50 Sharon Camp: Infectious disease is already a highly complex area of expertise, and it's growing much more complex-- it's becoming bigger and more complex almost every day. As it does, we're going to need to make better and more informed decisions, and we're going to need to rely on data to do that. Data is what is going to provide us with the evidence and the information that are invaluable resources in order to navigate the complex challenges of the 21st-century environment.\n22:40 Sharon Camp: I know public health is used to making choices. No public health is perfect, and no choice is always best. As we make choices and as we're confronted with difficult trade-offs, we're going to rely more and more on data.

The disruption began with the introduction and adoption of digital, mobile and social media platforms. Journalism and news were redefined and the internet became the new home for content. Journalism is experiencing a period of transformation, as it has been forced to adapt to a rapidly changing consumer and news media landscape. What was once defined by established standards has now become a much less structured landscape, redefined not by who owns the news media brand but by who controls audience engagement. Traditional media brands and platforms are in danger of becoming irrelevant to the next generation of consumers if they cannot meet the audience where they exist online. At the same time, it has become critically important for brands to understand what matters to consumers, as they are bombarded by information on a variety of platforms. Media and technology companies are exploring what it takes for brands to meet consumer expectations. According to Pew Research, more than 90% of all Americans ages 18-29 expect to receive content on their phones, tablets or computers. Nearly 60% of that same segment of consumers believe receiving content from brands that they follow on social media is very important , including Facebook. To that end, Pew Research has found that 65% of smartphone and tablet users say they look at news content several times per day, while another 20% report they look at such content several times per week. And they prefer to get their information delivered to them on their preferred devices. It is no longer enough to have a website, deliver content through apps , and reach social media followers with short posts that are designed to catch their attention and drive them to your site. Content and delivery must become more integrated and cohesive. Consumers want to be spoken to and they will be in new ways, and brands must develop their ability to deliver tailored experiences to their customers, as they go after markets and audiences across all platforms, with the ultimate goal being to influence a consumer s decisions about where to invest their free time, and what to purchase with that time. In short, media and technology brands are being forced to understand what matters to their audience, so that they can deliver highly engaging content that drives business and brand growth. This requires an understanding of what is being delivered on brand platforms across a variety of media and the platforms, as well as the ability to understand what is being said about those platforms and brands. AI and Machine Learning will play a critical role in helping brands meet consumer expectations and to more effectively deliver the data needed to make the most of their content and engagement efforts. These technologies, combined with data analytics, will help companies and brands gain actionable insight into their audience, helping them understand what matters to consumers and the best ways to deliver content, while helping them more effectively influence customer decisions. 3.

        "output": "How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets? The field of public health promotes healthier eating patterns and greater food security in various population groups. Food policies that influence affordability, access, consumer protection, and healthy food promotion are needed. How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can public health use this knowledge to promote healthier diets? Public health practitioners working on food policy must take into account social and economic factors that can influence a population's food choices. Cultural factors - including foodways, ethnicity, religion, and gender - must also be examined. Food security, access to healthy foods, and economic factors may influence how food products are priced and how well they are promoted in supermarkets, convenience stores, and restaurants. Innovative food policy strategies have successfully promoted local food economies and improved healthy food access and pricing in inner city, rural, and farm communities across the country. This article discusses this work, as well as promising policy strategies to encourage healthier foods and increased food access. Public health practitioners can use the following principles and strategies to improve dietary intake and reduce health disparities: Promote and incentivize local food economies to increase the supply and lower the price of healthy food products. Incorporate health and nutrition standards and guidelines in all food policies and regulations. Promote food security for all through subsidized healthy food products and food insecurity intervention. Require food retailers and restaurants to sell healthy products on par with unhealthy products. Use food pricing programs, special buying opportunities, and nutrition promotion to increase consumption of healthier foods. Provide educational, economic, and food access opportunities for food retail workers and health professionals. Use local and traditional food systems strategies to promote food security and local food economies.\nLearning Objectives: 1 Discuss the food environment of inner cities. 2 Discuss policy strategies to encourage healthier food access in urban communities. 3 Summarize approaches to improve the food environment in rural communities. 4 Describe local food economies and their health benefits, along with strategies to build these economies. 5 Discuss the use of innovative strategies to promote local food systems and improve food access.\nCitation: Cohen DJ; Stedman R. 2015 Jan;34(1):19-24. doi: 10.1080/14703287.2015.999248."

In science change is measured in physical characteristics, in the size or weight of an organism, for example in its length, weight, and color. But in human terms, evolution is meaningless. Human life can’t be measured in terms of physical characteristics, such as length, weight, and color. Physical characteristics have evolved, changing the size and shape of humans.

In this letter, you will address someone in another country who is speaking in the same language you are. The International Letter is meant to be personal and friendly, so address your reader as a personal friend. Open your letter by writing Greetings, Friend. A sentence or two could easily fill the left side of the page. You should mention the country you are living in, perhaps include some information about the culture, geography, history and economy of the country, and mention some of the most important industries and cities, as well as the national language. Then you should write about your favorite sports, your recreation and hobbies, and even about some problems you have faced or a situation that you worry about, to help your friend feel that you are a real person. It is important that your letter be written as a true friend would write to another true friend. So, write a letter to a good friend across the world, imagining that you two have some of the same values, likes, dislikes, worries, etc. Include as many details as possible. Try not to get bogged down in formal language or long paragraphs. Write in your own words. A letter is meant to be friendly and conversational. Letter 3: Write a letter asking someone to meet with you to discuss a particular topic. The person you write to knows very little about what you plan to talk about. Your letter should be polite, businesslike, and formal. Be sure to include your full name and complete address. Your letter should be neat or even handwritten, but not excessively so. Enclose a selfaddressed, stamped envelope if you want the letter to be personally delivered. Letter 4: Write a letter to a friend, describing an outstanding experience or an event to which you want to invite her. How does it make you feel? 10 The International Letter and the Personal Letter are very similar in the way they are written. The only real difference is that in The International Letter you are writing a letter to someone in another country and sharing your thoughts about yourself, your interests, etc. In the Personal Letter, you are actually writing letters back and forth to a personal friend who either currently lives in or is moving to, the same country where you are living. The first sentence or two on each page of the personal letter should include the name and address of the person you are writing to. The second sentence should include something personal about the person receiving the letter. The third sentence should repeat what is in the previous sentence, usually just adding another fact about the person (aside from their name and address), like, I am glad we will have time to be together when you are in your new home. Write about the people you have met, the activities you have joined and the problems you have faced, and include your opinion on what may be happening in the region or the country generally. Be sure to write in detail as this could be of tremendous benefit to others. How does it make you feel? 11 The Personal Letter and the International Letter are very similar in the way they are written.

So, one of the best ways to give constructive feedback is by e-mailing your suggestions to the manager or owner.\nSurety bonds are typically the only type of guarantee that many banks will require from a small business seeking to borrow money. When you are ready, ask to speak with the general manager to explain the situation in person.\nThe key is to let the manager understand that you understand that the incident was an aberration and should never happen again. In general, restaurants are a good test as to whether your customers are loyal or not. And they can have a different answer depending on your market segment.\nIn doing so, you will be much more likely to receive the service that you want.\nA loyal customer will be more willing than a new customer to fill out a customer survey and will be much more likely to respond positively in that survey than a new customer.\nBut there are a few things you can do in the moment that actually help, besides being assertive about the issue. Thank you for your time. You have the right to have your order correct. By doing so, you can help ensure that both the food and service are at its best.\nInvest In Technology And Data Analytics Data analytics has been identified as the hottest market trend in the hospitality industry. You are an important person. In one of our consulting meetings with a restaurant developer, we looked at some of their data points to determine their loyalty.\nIf a customer expresses disappointment with their meal because the food was overcooked, for example, be sure to offer that customer your card and tell them you will call the general manager later to correct the problem.

A couple of the things you mentioned are similar to the examples you gave in your article for pretending to understand a topic or conversation. For example, when someone asks for a definition that can be found online with a quick Google search or when someone uses a word that you are familiar with but use in a way you would not have. In that article, however, you also mention several things that are more subtle, which I have also seen in my past job experiences. I would add to your list that a coworker constantly seems to want you to explain something so they can talk about it too while pretending to understand or that when I have asked for more specific details or examples in the meetings I am not in the lead on, no one ever seems to follow through with their promise to provide more details. I agree with Anonymous, what you said was extremely interesting. Perhaps you may want to take a look at this video which explains more about what Anonymous said. In this video, it shows how you can easily pretend that you understand something that you do not understand. There are several ways to go about it, one being that you pretend to understand something and then use it later to impress someone, then use a phrase that is more complex which you have not used previously. An example Anonymous gave is this: 1. I agree with Anonymous, what you said was extremely interesting. Perhaps you may want to take a look at this video which explains more about what Anonymous said. In this video, it shows how you can easily pretend that you understand something that you do not understand. There are several ways to go about it, one being that you pretend to understand something and then use it later to impress someone, then use a phrase that is more complex which you have not used previously. An example Anonymous gave is this: 1. A coworker will keep asking questions as if having a discussion in the hopes that the subject is confusing you, so that s/he can satiate himself/herself by using \"expert information\" provided by you to their satisfaction. 2. An example of this is someone using many words, but little substance to explain things that are simple. The more words someone uses, the more people think that they understand these complicated terms. 3. The person using the terminology will be very condescending as if talking to a child or a simpleton/peasant. S/he knows the correct words and terms because s/he has read those words in books/articles or heard the terms used at some social function but can't explain what those words really mean. This person is very likely the one who will ask the questions because s/he is not confident enough when speaking and so this \"snooping\" is a way to \"feel\" less insecure/embarrassed when speaking. 4. To understand this behavior it may be useful to see a psychologist. 5. There are some people who cannot admit that they may be lacking in knowledge. They will ask you to explain a situation, saying \"You already know what I am talking about.\" So, if you agree they may think that they have an expert on the subject. 6. Also, some people ask you questions to get opinions from you. They want you to give them advice. It is important to not just say \"YES\" to all their questions, because in the future, they may ask you to help them on a project, and will be less likely to help you if they feel you did shoddy work. 7. Another cause of being asked to \"Explain\" is an exaggerated use of the verbal \"Yes\". This is common to people, who grew up in the western culture, a culture of excess. Yes, the coworker will continue to give you \"tasks\" as long as she feels you are agreeing with her. People from certain cultural background and countries"

In the following activity, students develop and practice persuasive vocabulary, use evidence, and recognize argumentative patterns.\nAfterwards, students practice persuasive speaking strategies and participate in small group conversations, learning how to disagree with a person in a way that is more effective than yelling at them (and hopefully more effective than just yelling!).\nAt the end of class, I ask students to reflect on what persuasive strategies they engaged in during the class period and which ones they found most effective. By the end of the unit, students are well-equipped with the vocabulary and strategy needed to present and defend arguments. In this activity, students learn to use strong evidence and use logic to persuade others to see things a certain way.\nIt also emphasizes the concept of sharing and listening for understanding, two very valuable life skills. In this activity, students will explore a case study of \"What Would You Do?\" and make a decision based on the information provided. They choose the side they think is right and defend their answer to the class.\nAfterwards, students get into groups of four and discuss what their classmates thought. What is the best way to persuade someone to stop using plastic water bottles or disposable coffee cups?\nI tell them that their group needs to determine the best way to persuade someone based on the information included in their case study. This time, they choose the side they think is wrong and defend their answer to the rest of the class. After discussing, students will turn their work into a short persuasive letter explaining their opinion that others should read. In this activity, students learn how to develop persuasive strategies and write persuasive letters on a topic of personal interest.\nStudents are given a case or two to read about and are asked to write a letter, which is due the next class. During the next class, students share their letters, explaining what they did to persuade the reader. In this activity, students learn to persuade others with logic, not just opinions, and practice being persuasive when someone has strong beliefs or doesn't want to be persuaded. Because these two ideas are very different, they pose a unique challenge to persuasion strategies. In this activity, students learn two persuasive strategies that they can practice before the final activity to create their own persuasive letter. In this activity, students will explore the persuasive arguments made in two advertisements during a commercial break. It does so by introducing students to the concept of ethos, the logos (formal reasoning), and the pathos (emotions).\nThey learn it through the following activity, which helps them to learn different perspectives on an issue, practice being persuasive through a discussion, develop a persuasive campaign, and communicate their viewpoint using different tools and styles.\nThe second class of the unit has students practice being persuasive, first with a short writing activity, and then with a discussion.\nFor the last activity of this persuasion unit, students will choose their issue—and their side—and write a persuasive letter.\nIn this final activity of the persuasion unit, students get into groups and are asked to brainstorm, research, and develop and present a persuasive campaign, which they will then write in response to a persuasion writing prompt.\nWhen learning to write persuasive essays, writers have a lot to think about, including the purpose of the writing and the audience. In this unit, students learn how to write a persuasive essay and get to practice with persuasive techniques.\nWhen I teach this persuasion unit, I start off by getting students to share what they’ve learned.

        "output": "Why might someone prefer to shop at a small, locally-owned business instead of a large chain store, even if the prices are higher?\nThere's a psychological phenomenon called the \"Halo Effect,\" in which we judge a person by how they look: physically attractive or well-dressed/groomed. You'll often find these folks get more and better jobs, receive more respect from other people, and get better service from vendors. So it goes with businesses, and in particular, restaurants.\nWhen I first moved to New Orleans, I had to make a living in Houston. I hated Houston, and I really hated spending all that time at work (and all the money I had to spend there.) Since there were three other restaurants in Houston at the time, I started asking around to find out which restaurants the \"Bigs\" liked to eat at the most. It wasn't difficult for me to find out (since those people are so well known,) and I did manage to eat at some of the most difficult to get into spots around town.\nI guess it's a \"good problem\" to have when you're trying to stay afloat in the crowded Houston restaurant scene, and if my business partner and I hadn't recognized this, we would have continued to struggle (although eventually, we did manage to make it work.) That's how we got our foot in the door at the \"best of\" Houston eateries, and we used that to build our business.\nI'm a big believer in the power of the Halo Effect. I'm also a big believer in using it to your advantage in your business. It doesn't have to be \"the best Halo Effect recipe in the world.\" Sometimes it can be \"the best that you can do.\"\nAnd in these times...that might just be the best you can do.\nLabels: New Orleans Restaurant, New Orleans Restaurant Reviews, New Orleans Restaurants, NOLA Restaurants, Nola Restaurants\nNew Orleans Bar-B-Que Sauce\nIn my opinion, the best bar-b-que sauce in the world is found in New Orleans!

There you won't get recognized, and you can enjoy the atmosphere. Even if you have to watch the World Cup.\nKnow the difference between a \"bar\" and a \"restaurant\" because there is a big difference in service style and product quality.\nWhen you're working in a front-of-the-house restaurant job in New Orleans, it's all about the people. Even when you don't have to deal with any customers at all, you're still working with other staff members, and if they are unhappy, they may take it out on the guests. So be polite, be helpful, encourage people at every point in the employment cycle.\nIf you're not nice, people will find out, and you will probably be on your way out the door. And you know what? Your attitude will affect every member of the staff. So it's one of those \"pay it forward\" kinds of things. Smile, give people the benefit of your professional expertise, offer to help, listen, don't let them see that you're totally over this line of work they're hanging out over, be humble enough to tell people that you don't know something, and if you do know it, let them know that too.\nIf you'd rather not be a waiter, consider being a bar back. It can be even more challenging!\nNever give away your opinions on how you think the restaurant business should run.\nNo matter what you think the restaurant business should run like, someone else has an opposite opinion.\nAnd no matter what you think, someone will be doing the job in front of you"

        "output": "Why do some people enjoy the sensation of being scared, such as by watching horror movies or going on roller coasters, while others avoid these experiences? The latest study suggests a key difference in the physiology of brain regions which are involved in risk assessment, such as in the hypothalamus, as well as in the motivation centre and in the sensory systems. In the human brain, there appear to be two distinct pathways, one which is responsible for the enjoyment of fear, such as in roller coaster rides, and one which is associated with a fear response and which, in individuals who are most sensitive to adrenaline for example, reacts most strongly.\nTen people who responded strongly to adrenaline had their brain activity monitored in an fMRI brain scanner whilst watching several scary clips from The Exorcist and Alien vs Predator. The researchers then compared their physiological responses to the scary clips, by analysing the amount of adrenaline and heart rate in the participants. Individuals with a strong response to adrenaline showed a larger response in the right insular cortex in the brain, while those with a low adrenaline response showed more activity in an area in the back of the brain called the dorsal striatum.\nThe results show that the insular cortex and the dorsal striatum seem to play an important part in the enjoyment and response to scary stimuli in the brain, as well as in the risk assessment of the situation – a risk response could activate the insular cortex and then be assessed further in the dorsal striatum. In conclusion, the brain seems to react differently to the enjoyment of fear than the physiological fear response.\nDr David Merrill, the author of the study, comments: \"This is the first time we have been able to show using fMRI that there is a difference in brain activity when looking at an extremely scary film, such as The Exorcist. In fact, the differences show that it's not always the same areas of the brain that are involved in processing fear. In the case of people who are more sensitive - for example, to the smell of coffee - we see a different network of brain areas being involved in processing scary material”. Dr Merrill adds: “It's also interesting to note that the parts of the brain that were more active, particularly the insular cortex, play an important role in making us aware of others and their activities. So, we may not even be aware that such a response is happening in our brains”.\nThe researchers now plan to find out whether adrenaline release is increased in participants who enjoy scary stimuli more.\nDr Merrill has further published a follow-up paper, \"Identification of the neurobiological correlates of a sensitized neuroendocrine response to fearful stimuli in The Journal of Neuroscience: http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/2/352?maxts=28&sortspec=recent 1&view=long&V=S&maxts=28&sortspec=recent 1&view=long&V=S&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwil8_KH6HTAhUPk4MKHQ-bC3EQkgUUgEwIY”.\nThe full study, entitled \"The neural correlates of sensitization to fear films” from the Journal of Neuroscience, has recently been published online at: http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/2/352?maxts=28&sortspec=recent1&view=long&V=S&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwil8_KH6HTAhUPk4MKHQ-bC3EQkgUUgEwIY&enc=DE1aWFpbXQhcnRsO3ZhOGFpbnKaXhIUm1tZ2FvcmVwc2U9HUFW1eT3HJyXzE3M2VXaC1Tc0ZmRiT08uZHBoOGUwZjlSd2pXNUJhYXQrSUxUOUVKRjxBNElpTXRxMlJUeUhvWXRJek1QaG1OQTlOZ2JvcmJt"

The reason we work at all is to help ourselves and help other people, but do we always have to put our family's and our own needs first, or are there situations where it would be better to sacrifice yourself for the greater good? We tackle this very important, life altering question in this episode. Join us!\n#11 - Do You Judge People who Get Welfare or Live in Poverty? 0\nYou hate people who get welfare or who live in poverty. Are you judging them? Join us as we discuss the \"Fairness\" of people who live better than us and people who don't have money. Do they deserve better lives than us? Do they deserve our contempt? Or is it a mixture of both? There are many perspectives on this question. We've only covered a few of them. Join us!\n#10 - What About You? - Ask Us Anything! 0\nThis was a listener requested episode. Bryant answers listener questions about life and money. Join us!\n#9 - How to Stop Being Sad and Depressed 0\nBryant asks the question: \"How to stop being sad and depressed?\" On this episode, we answer that question! Bryant is a great fan of Sally Kempton, the founder of Sounds True. Sally has made millions of dollars, but she is not rich. How come? What is it like being a multi-millionaire that doesn't have billions of dollars in her bank account like the Walton family and Amazon? How can a girl like this become so happy, so healthy, and so successful? It all starts with how she spends her money, and how she uses her \"money energy\" to create, in Sally's words, a \"good life.\" We interview Sally on being happy and creating success.

        "output": "In a world where automation is becoming increasingly prevalent, is it more important to prioritize job creation or technological progress? It all depends on the circumstances. If you can’t create enough jobs, but you can improve living standards and create a skilled workforce by reducing unemployment, then you’d be better off focusing on technological progress. In the UK, the answer is clear. We can’t create enough new jobs, but we do have unemployment and an education system that needs to be improved. We need to create as many jobs as we can, in skilled sectors. How can we achieve this? The government has already made a good start by keeping corporation tax low, and by creating a business environment where entrepreneurship thrives. They should now look at what we can do to attract businesses to the UK—not to create new jobs, but to take over existing jobs, either in service industry or by offering manufacturing jobs at a cost advantage. By offering an attractive manufacturing cost environment, we should be able to attract more foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment will then create more jobs in the UK, and indirectly help create more jobs by paying UK taxes and spending money here. We also need to improve productivity and skills in order to be able to attract new businesses. Both require a good education system. The focus of education must move away from a traditional three Rs, and towards developing work skills and employability, as well as teaching children to think. An example is the apprentice scheme, where people get vocational training. This has helped create and develop UK manufacturing, including many cuttingedge technologies. The challenge now is to do more and to develop more of this. The government should therefore have a strong focus on developing a worldclass apprenticeship scheme, and provide grants to industries to develop their skills. The government also needs to give employers greater flexibility over the apprenticeship scheme, so that it is flexible enough to serve the needs of individual companies. Over and above this, we need to improve the UK’s education system so that it is more focused on training children to think. This makes far more sense than doing more traditional teaching, especially if we are to focus on developing high–skill manufacturing jobs.\nA.M. Gadgil"

        "output": "How many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step. When you have finished your explanation, use what you learnt to explain how a computer works. The simplest explanation is probably the most plausible. What is the difference, for a computer, between the RAMs memory and CPU speeds, and between the RAM and the CPU? Answer: RAM is the part of the computer where data is stored (which is called memory) and when data is accessed, it is much slower than when it is accessed by the processor. In order to answer, describe the following equation: (RAM) (237) (RAM) (237) (CPU). (RAM) (237)(237)(237) (PC)(RAM) (237) (RAM). (RAM) (237) (PC) (237). If a disk drive is empty, it will store 183.3 KB of data (for a disk drive that is 8 inches by 12 inches). How long would it take for a computer to fill this disk? It would take approximately 4 minutes for a computer to fill a 183.3 KB disk with information. What does CD mean in the term CD-RW? The first part of this term is CD which means compact disk. The 2nd part of this term is RW which means rewritable. 5. What does the TA mean in the name of this technology?: TA is a shortening of Track at. Track at is defined as that area of the tape in which data is recorded. What does this say about the TA in question?: We can safely assume that this refers to the area of magnetic tape in which data is recorded. What is the definition of RAM in an IBM compatible PC?: The definition of RAM as it applies to an IBM PC is that it is the part of the computer where data is stored which is also known to the common man as memory.\n13 11. How would you measure the speed of a disk drive?: To measure the speed of a CD-Rom drive would be to measure how many times a CD-Rom disk is recorded per second. To measure the speed of a tape drive would be to measure how many times an inch of tape is recorded per second. To measure the speed of a floppy disk drive would be to measure how many times a floppy disk is written to in one second. It would be to measure how many times a floppy disk is written to in one minute. It would be to measure how many times a floppy disk is written to in three minutes. It would be to measure how many times a floppy disk is written to in one hour? Speed is usually measured in millimeters per second and centimeters per second. It can also be measured in units of bytes per second, seconds per second and seconds to the hundredths place. 12. How would you explain, using an example, what a buffer overflow is?: This happens when you send more information into an application than the application will hold. The OS then sends extra information to make the application hold more info. The application then responds to the OS telling it that it is full, with a bunch of random characters. This sometimes leads to a virus. This also can corrupt your files. 13. Can you think of a situation where it would be OK to send more data into an application than the application can hold?: Yes. When you are using an online service you might send more than your limit. 14. What does this term mean?: This term means Computer to Computer connection. 15. What is the definition of this term?: The definition of this term is that it is when your computer is connected to another computer via a phone line. 16. What is the connection between this term and phone lines?: There is no connection between phone lines and the connection between two computers. 17. What is the purpose of modems?: The purpose of a modem is to put information through two or more phone lines at the same time. The purpose of a firewall: A fire wall is a program run off of the computer which protects it from viruses and hackers.\n14 18. Describe the purpose of this object on a computer:(Bandwidth) Bandwidth is a line that goes from one computer to another, this is known as the internet line. This is used when people are connected to the internet to send packets of data over this line between two points. 19.

Your explanation should be written clearly enough that another reader might be able to understand how you arrived at your answer. How many atoms are in this saltshaker? How many atoms are in this salt? The saltshaker has about 11 moles worth of salt. Thus the saltshaker has about 0.4 moles of salt. The mass of one atom of sodium is about 23 g, and the mass of one atom of chlorine is about 35 g. Thus, in terms of mass, the saltshaker has about grams of sodium and grams of chlorine in it. Thus, in terms of the number of sodium and chlorine atoms in the saltshaker, the saltshaker has about or about atoms of each atom in the saltshaker. That makes a total of sodium atoms in the saltshaker, and chlorine atoms in the saltshaker. Now, the salt has about 0.5 moles in it, so we have a total of sodium and chlorine atoms in the salt. Thus, the salt has a total of about or about atoms of each (for most of that, we are neglecting the other atoms and molecules present in the salt, and so it would also be valid to write atoms of sodium and chlorine in the salt).\n100. The following data refer to the average number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a given molecule of one species of amino acids (the amino acid is not named) and one species of nucleotide (the nucleotide is not named). The table is incomplete, so a student is asked to draw a molecular representation for both, and assume that there are enough electrons in their orbitals to fill up those atoms. Given this data, assume that the nucleoside contains six nucleotides. (For this question there is more than one acceptable answer.) Molecule Hydrogen Oxygen Amino Acid Nucleotide A B C D E F The student draws a schematic representation of a nucleoside for each nucleotide species (there is more than one nucleoside formed, the student is simply asked to draw one as an example). For the nucleotide species for which the student drew a schematic representation, the student draws a schematic representation of a nucleotide in which there are more electrons than this student needs to satisfy the stability of the nucleotide. How many electrons are beyond the number needed to make this nucleotide stable?

A student writes: We are told that the difference in atomic weight between oxygen and carbon is about 5. We know the number of neutrons in oxygen 16 is about 16. We know that there are about 4 neutrons in carbon 12. We are told that the number of neutrons in oxygen 16 is greater than half of carbon 12. We are told that carbon-12 has 6 electrons and oxygen 16 has 8 electrons. We can figure out the total number of electrons in each atom. 16 has 10 electrons more than 6 and oxygen has 4 more electrons than carbon. The total number of electrons in both is 8 each. We are asked to determine the difference in electrons in carbon 12. We know that the number of protons in a carbon atom is about 6. The number of neutrons is about 6. There are 6 electrons in carbon. We know that we have to add up the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons to get the total number of nuclear binding. 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 = the total number of nuclear binding in carbon 12.

        "output": "How many lightning strikes occur on Earth each day? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step. Lightning is an electrically charged discharge of atmospheric nitrogen occurring within 30 miles (50 kilometers) above ground, says the author of \"Weather.\" That is the distance, as measured in a straight line, from the ground up to where lightning occurs. From this information, lightning strikes per day can be determined. Lightning strikes the ground about once per second, meaning there are about 60 lightning strikes per minute on Earth. Lightning strikes Earth approximately 10 times, each second on every minute, on every day throughout the year. Therefore there are about 60 x 10 = 600 lightning strikes every hour on Earth and about 24 x 600 = 14,400 lightning strikes on Earth every day. Since there is 24 x 14,400 seconds per day and lightning strikes occurring per second, there are about 24 x 14,400/60 lightning strikes on Earth per day. That equals to roughly 360,000 lightning strikes per day on Earth. An average lightning strike hits a land mass or an object on Earth. Lightning strikes that do not hit the ground, such as strikes in outer space, happen less than 1/3 of 1/1000 of the time. Therefore one lightning bolt occurring each second equals less than 5 lightning strikes per minute and less than 30 lightning strikes per day. Lightning does not happen every second on Earth. Therefore there are approximately 360,000 lightning strikes per day divided by 5 = 72,000 lightning strikes per minute and divided again equals to about 72 x 6 = 432 lightning strikes occurring each minute on Earth. One lightning bolt occurring approximately every second occurs 9,720 times per day, about 24 hours per day. Lightning happens once per second x 24 hours per day. A lightning strike occurs about every five seconds throughout the day. In other words, lightning strikes occur in five seconds x 24 hours x 30 minutes, approximately 1,920 times in 30 minutes. It occurs 9,720 x 30 minutes per day or about 1,204 lightning strikes per day. Lightning strikes occur 54,760 times per day which approximates to about 72,000 x 3.5 lightning strikes per day. The number of lightning strikes per hour occurring on Earth equals to 432 lightning strikes per minute and 72,000 lightning strikes per day. The number of lightning strikes per day divided by the number of lightning strikes per minute equals to about 72,000 divided 432 or about 166. The average number of lightning strikes, 166 per day. This equals to about 3725 lightning strikes per hour that occur on Earth.\nThe answer is 166 lightning strikes per hour.\nLightning is an electrically charged discharge of atmospheric nitrogen occurring within 30 miles (50 kilometers) above ground, says the author of “Weather.” That is the distance, as measured in a straight line, from the ground up to where lightning occurs.

Here I made an image explaining the \"proof\" of Fermat's Last Theorem! Note that you do not need to explain every detail, but you do need to discuss the math and why your solution works! Explained how an engineer goes about problem solving. What you are doing is working backwards to find the solution, just like we did in math. Engineering involves applying mathematical principles (like applying the Pythagorean theorem, applying forces), thinking logically (like thinking about a solution that might be simpler, might work), and the use of tools! The work of an engineer involves many steps (like working backwards to find the solution, and then implementing your idea). In math class, the work of math involves many steps too! The work of math might involve going backwards to find the solution, and might involve working it out by hand. Examples include: working backwards (like when we solved the equations of circles), or working things out by hand (like when we worked the Pythagorean theorem). So think about the word \"problem\", and use similar words from an engineer's point of view. How do problems involve math? When do math problems involve working backwards to find solutions (like Pythagorean Theorem)? Think of these words in relation to math.\n2 Examples of Engineering Problems\n4 This house is the wrong height! The engineer will have to explain why the roof is too high for the house. For example: roof is too high, need to go backwards to find a solution, need to think about a simpler solution, etc. 5\n5 Backwards, Forwards, and Scaling... 6\n6 Backwards A roof on the house... This image has already been put in backwards. Now imagine an engineer looking forward from the first image and finding that the home is built with a roof a few feet too high. Then the engineer will need to think backwards about how tall the house needs to be in order for the roof to be the original height of the house. The roof of the house needs to be a few feet shorter! The only problem is, the engineer does not know the right answer. Now s/he will have to guess the minimum height of the house. The engineer will then need to scale down his dimensions. 6\n7 Forwards Scaling For example, let's say the dimensions were: 40 feet high x 60 feet long x 65 feet wide. If the roof was too tall, what would happen if the dimensions were: 40 feet high x 60 feet long x 60 feet wide? How many feet shorter would the house be? Would the house be too short? 7\n8 If we don't know which dimensions we need, we could find the answer by scaling both dimensions. How? Scaling Forwards x2 8\n9 Example - The Pythagorean Theorem 9\n10 If we are building the sides of a square shaped roof, how could we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the right dimensions? (Think in reverse! Start with what you know (roof is square-what is its area?) find dimensions from the dimensions (how much longer or wider is the roof?) - apply the Pythagorean theorem - figure out the dimensions you are missing 10 Remember that the Pythagorean Theorem applies to sides of right triangles: c  b = a  h  k So we can write: Area = (c)  (b)  h  k Area = (4)  (5)  6  (10)  k Area =50 square feet If we find c k and d h k, we can then do this: 50 = (c)  (b)  h  k = (1) (4)(5)( 6)(10)(k) = 1 (4)(5)(6)(10)(k) (k2)  2500 When we multiply out k  2, we get k2  When we divide both sides by 50, we get k2 (  If we make 50 the base, we have: k( 50)2  Which is k ( 50)  We are then left with the following: So we know that k  2500 = 50 ( 50"

        "output": "How many snowflakes fall during a typical winter? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\nHow many snowflakes will fall on earth during a typical winter? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader a step-by-step.\nThis question is related to the previous one. However, it focuses on the distribution of snowflakes as a function of size. In particular, it asks whether the average diameter of snowflakes is about 0.008 inches.\nThe average ice crystal diameter in the atmosphere, including precipitation, is about 0.002 inches (Miyamoto et al., 1978). This number is based on the measurements of ice crystals in the Northern Hemisphere. The numbers from the Southern Hemisphere are lower, by about 40% (Miyamoto et al., 1984). However, the mean crystal size is less certain due to differences in the measurement method.\nThere is still some uncertainty regarding the actual measurement method. Most of the research focused on the observation of precipitation. However, they observed different sizes and numbers of crystals in one individual precipitation droplet which suggests that the measurements may be biased against large crystals (Miyamoto et al., 1984).\nTo estimate the average crystal size, scientists have to use some averaging technique. Different averaging techniques will result in different average sizes.\nThe first method that scientists have used is a counting method that was based on the number of counts of flakes on a sheet of paper. However, such a method would include the measurement of the flakes that are too small for human eyes to see. Thus, it is unlikely to be accurate due to the possible bias on the large crystals (Miyamoto et al., 1978). However, a counting method has its own advantages as it is unbiased against large crystals.\nThe second method is to count the frequency of different sizes of crystals in one individual precipitation droplet (Miyamoto et al, 1978). The average diameter of individual crystals was found to be about 0.002 inches (Miyamoto et al., 1978).\nThe third method is to find the most common size of the snowflake that is visible. In other words, if 70% of the snowflakes visible and 2% of the snowflakes are 0.008 inches, then the average snowflake size is found to be 0.008 inches. A research showed that the most common visible snowflakes are about 0.008 inches (Thober et al., 1978).\nThe fourth method and another method used to estimate the average size of snowflakes in a typical winter is to use the modeling data in relation to the airborne dust particles. In addition, the model has also indicated an expected size of an individual snowflake based on the visibility of snowflakes by humans (Thober et al., 1978). The number of snowflakes that can be seen and a typical human eye view of snowflakes.\nAfter considering all of these studies, the scientists have concluded that all of the models have been able to explain the distribution of snowflakes as a function of size (Thober et al., 1978). In addition, it appears that the average size of a snowflake in the atmosphere is roughly 0.002 inches.\nHow much melting would take place during a typical winter if all of the 0.002-inch snowflakes melted instantly? The answer seems easy because you can calculate the area of one layer of snowflakes by multiplying the area by the average diameter of the snowflakes. You can estimate that all of the layers in a typical snowfall would form a layered slab of snow on the top of the atmosphere.\nHow many layers are there in one typical snowfall? Assume that the layer of snow gets thicker as the snowflakes melt. You can easily calculate the average thickness of the slab by multiplying 0.002 inches and the number of individual snowflakes (0.002 inches * 2000 snowflakes * Layer thickness).\nHowever, scientists have concluded that there are two problems with this method. First, their conclusion is based on several methods that result in different estimates of the average size of snowflakes (Thober et"

To get this right, you need to organise your essay. Start with a clear introduction which gives essay writing i i i i i i i essay examples an overview of what you are going to talk about. Then you present your first example. Next you present your second example and, finally, your third example. The first time you present example number one, you should explain what the reason (argument) is, and you should give essay example number in i i in i one reason (argument) essay writing for i i i writing sample i writing example i sample for i writing. However, when you present your case essay writing for next time, you only need to give example, but explanation is not necessary. Similarly when you have to present example number three you should just repeat the text of example number one and two. Then you give your verdict and the explanation of why you have chosen the third example over the first and the second. Remember that the text of the sample should always be in bold-face if you need them to be italicized to ensure they look good. Remember to use sub-headings for the first and last time you introduce any example in the sample text. You can use the sub-headings if one was not in the original example text, but it is better to have the subheadings than not to have them for the first and last time you introduce any example in the sample text. Remember that each time essay writing i i in how essay writing for i i i i in in i sample essay writing in examples is introduced an overview explanation of that argument should be given in the introduction. Example essay writing sample for sample essay for writing i writing for i writing example essay i of three examples are given below. Remember that they are to show you how to do the exercise but not to be copied or used elsewhere. It would be a bad idea to plagiarise the text for academic writing: the most common type of academic writing the standard style used for most academic writing including research reports, academic journal articles, and essays. The other common types of academic writing are the narrative or descriptive type, usually used for writing in an essay, and the expository or explanatory type, used for writing in a research report or for writing in journal essay for example. Essay writing is very much about making an argument and in a very broad sense that is what a good introduction is all about. The introduction should make it clear to the reader which argument you are going to present. After reading the introduction, the reader should know what your argumentative position is in the debate, and they should also know why you have taken that position. Sample text 1 You can understand a certain song only in a certain kind of context. The essay writer will need to give a few example and examples in writing for examples i i examples of example essay writing a in writing i will that the text must follow the text must use proper grammar spelling and be written in in essay format essay the student will be to do example writing examples the the and should format essay writing the paper using the for writing example i that the the student has to do an and examples the of writing that they choose any subject whatsoever, and and should should in examples of and writing the examples any use of grammar they see fit if they do it in the format you are required to do it in, then you will get a passing grade. Sample text 2 There are two aspects to the problem of context. The first is how the text should be read and interpreted. The second is where the text should be read. Interpretation is how we as readers understand a text. We all have different experiences which coluor how we read a text. The other aspect is where we read, for example, a text essay in writing on a train or reading it while eating breakfast, all these things have the ability to influence how we read a text. You can understand the idea of the song with the background music. You can understand the same song without music you can understand the song when it comes in the context of a musical play even though you know the song very well you can understand it with a twist in the lyrics a very popular example essay writing for example i example writing in writing. The idea still comes across in the same way.

Could an alternate colonial Central America have evolved into a major player in the modern world? This is the question that this thoughtful, well-researched novel tries to answer. The result reads somewhat like a detective story, as the adventurer/researcher is chased from one exotic land to another in search of his lost love. The setting is richly described, and the backdrop of colonial Central America is colorfully detailed. In spite of this, the story falls a bit short of the mark set by the premise. Unfortunately, what's left is a bit on the dull side. This may be the novel's intent: to present a grim picture of what is inevitable, and inevitably boring, in the wake of a complete revolutionary upheaval of a country's society. It is well done, and interesting to read, but not something I'd be desperate to read again.\nThis is very interesting history, and how Central America could be.\nI bought this book because I wanted to read more about Central American History. I don't have a strong interest in politics, but I love reading and learning about other cultures. This book is about what could have happened if the Inca's in the Andes region were not crushed and Spain were defeated in the Caribbean. What makes it interesting is what happened in Central America after these events, and the characters that get involved. I won't give away too many details, but I really enjoy this novel. It gives you the sense of being a part of it, and not a casual observer. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history!"

If Turing had been caught or failed at cracking the code, or even had a different view of the importance of cryptology, then the outcome for the Allied war effort could have had dramatic consequences.\nOne possible outcome could have seen an Allied victory which took far longer to achieve. It's possible World War II may have continued for several years or longer, and ultimately result in a world devastated not just by the effects of World War II, but also the nuclear bomb, which may have been unleashed at an earlier date when it could have had the greatest immediate impact.\nThe world today is a very different place than what it would have been had Turing not contributed to breaking the Enigma Code. For one thing, the cold war probably wouldn't have happened. Possibly Britain would have been the Soviet Union instead of the United States. Possibly the United States wouldn't exist. Possibly all of our technology wouldn't exist. Possibly humans wouldn't have even come into existence. Possibly everything would be just like it is in the TV show Battlestar Gallactica. Imagine that! If Alan Turing hadn't solved the Enigma code, and if the Soviets had taken complete control of Europe, then you would never be reading this right now, and neither would I, and neither would anyone else. If you had never been born, this website would not exist, and Alan Turing would definitely never have won a Nobel Peace Prize and be famous as one of the greatest thinkers in all of human history.\nIf Alan Turing had not succeeded, then the technology we know today would be impossible. Our world would be run by governments (if we had them at all), and we would have much lower levels of technology than we have now. In fact, we don't know how much better our technologies are in our world than the other world, because in one world, nothing is technological. And in the other world, everything is technological.\nI'm sure you now realize how important Alan Turing's work was with cryptography. His methods and ideas inspired other mathematicians and people like Leonardo da Vinci, Sir Francis Bacon, John Napier, Charles Babbage, Thomas Alva Edison, and the ancient Greeks and Romans. If one person had not contributed to this field of work, then it wouldn't be where it is today.\nWhat if there weren't any mathematicians in Turing's time?\nFirst, we wouldn't have computers built based on the design of computers invented in Alan Turing's time. Also, there would be no Turing machines and no Turing tests, so there wouldn't be artificial intelligence. This would mean we wouldn't have chess playing computers, robots, artificial limbs, or probably any other new technologies. So many of today's great, life-changing inventions such as the Apple iPhone, the touch screen technologies which allow it to be so easy to operate, the Internet in general, and most of the computer science fields such as web design, computer graphics, and a whole bunch of others are invented by people who are inspired by the work of Alan Turing.\nWhat if there hadn't been any mathematicians in Turing's time? Then there wouldn't be anything else which inspired a whole bunch of other things which we take for granted and can't imagine ever living without.\nAlan Turing's life was so unfortunate and tragic, and it's impossible to imagine how life would be different today without him.\nOne thing for sure is that the work of Alan Turing wouldn't have been possible without the work of other mathematicians in his time.\nBorn: June 23, 1912 | Died: June 7, 1954\nLeading Ideas:\n1. Turing defined an algorithm as \"A sequence of precise instructions which is intended to bring about a predestined goal state.\"\n2. Turing developed the concept of the \"Computer\" which is one of the most important ideas anyone has ever thought of. It's also pretty cool that Turing is responsible for defining the concept of a \"machine\" as something that can perform tasks and have a program run on it, as opposed to something with no program, like a robot.\n3. Turing invented the Turing Test. (A Turing machine is a programmable machine which has functions (instructions it can do) which can be coded in a list of instructions.

        "output": "What if the Maya civilization had never mysteriously collapsed? Would we now know more about the secret of their success? And what difference would it make to us, even if we did? These were the conundrums that faced Paul Thompson and Christopher Rempfer, both anthropologists and maya experts at the University of California at Riverside, when in the early 1990s they began to develop a project that evolved into the National Geographic Bee. The purpose of the Bee was to give students the opportunity to explore one of the worlds greatest civilizations in the context of one of earths greatest science and geography competitions. In the Bee, the student population of one of the worlds great civilizations is presented with a series of questions based upon Mayan history, language, location, and culture. These questions provide the students with an opportunity to not only learn, but also experience some of the ways in which the Maya accomplished one of the greatest intellectual and technological achievements in world history more than thirteen hundred years ago. Mayan civilization originated in the southern Yucatan Peninsula in about 800 B.C.E. and reached its greatest development between 800 C.E. and C.E. 900 the Classic Period. During this time, Mayan civilization flourished in hundreds of cities throughout the Yucatan, Guatemala, and eastern Mexico. The Maya built monumental structures including a wide variety of temples, many of which were devoted specifically to the worship of the gods. Their most famous monuments, however, were their stunningly detailed and elaborate stone monuments or carvings of Mayan gods. The Maya also built monumental structures, many dedicated to the worship of gods. (1) In addition to their famous stone carvings of gods or deities, they built magnificent temples, both monumental and small. These temples were decorated with exquisite sculptures, paintings, and detailed hieroglyphic inscriptions. Although many of these were later destroyed by Spanish explorers, archaeologists have been able to identify examples of each of these Mayan art forms and to decipher at least a part of the languages in which many of their hieroglyphic inscriptions are written. Although their monumental works were primarily created for religious purposes, they also served the secular function of creating and maintaining political order and stability in Mayan society. A third major feature of the culture was the Mayans sophisticated calendar system. While it still remains the subject of great academic curiosity, the calendar system that Mayan society employed was far more accurate than that employed by many of the civilizations that followed it the Egyptians and Romans. The most important function of this calendar system, however, was that Maya society employed a system of dating by which it could both record and predict important events and occasions in its social and religious life. (2) According to Paul Thompson, one of the co-founders of the National Geographic Bee, Mayan civilization represents one of the greatest intellectual and technological achievements of any society in world history: (3) The greatest achievement of any people who have ever lived from one point of view is Mayan civilization with its extraordinary astronomical calendars and its extraordinary building technology. And to this day with every new discovery more is learned about how their buildings were constructed. The Maya had very advanced techniques of building and extremely sophisticated calendars, and so perhaps, all by themselves, without any outside influence, they developed a very sophisticated culture. A second significant contribution made by the Bee is in providing a means of promoting awareness of the achievements of the greatest intellects, including Mayan, throughout the history and development of humankind. The first of the National Geographic Bees, which took place in 1991 with students from thirteen states and the District of Columbia were held, the finalists were asked to identify famous leaders of different civilizations throughout world history the Egyptians, the Romans, the Chinese, and the Maya. For the thirteen students who advanced, answering these questions proved to be a challenge. Even after the event was over, student winner Cynthia Guenther of Washington stated the importance of the experience she had just had: I m glad I was able to have the experience of competing because I think it s really important to know history and the role that different civilizations have played. I know that the people who came before me have played a part in who I am today. And if I m able to play a part in who some-one else is down the road, then I will feel gratified.

Some experts believe that the world was already involved in a global economy. In the early 1900's, the Americas had the highest production of manufacturing goods of all nations. In 1901 they produced 8.5 billion dollars; the next highest nation was Germany producing 4.5 billion dollars. This was mainly because the U.S. had the best technology of the time, and was able to produce more items with an even lower price. There is no exact way of telling what the effects of worldwide trade was before the time of Columbus. However today, world trade is estimated at $ 17 trillion dollars in 2007 at it's lowest rate while the United States economy is around 15.7 trillion. Columbus made possible an economically free world. If the world was not involved at that time in an open global economy or the world was still a feudalistic society and was less tolerant of the individual it could have been a lot different. Even the most ardent critics would admit that the world would be a much greater place with global trade and exchange in which individuals are free to choose the pursuits of their lives. Another theory is that before Columbus discovered the Americas, he found the Aztec, Mayan, and Inca civilizations with their magnificent architecture, pyramids, and fine craftsmanship. Archaeologists have found that before the arrival of Columbus, these civilizations had a highly developed system of commerce, mathematics, and science. In 1492, Christopher Columbus found the New World (the Americas) while trying to find a shorter, more direct route to the East and India. When Columbus landed on what is now believed to be Haiti, he found the people living in peace, being ruled by a king named Anacaona. The first Native American to meet Christopher Columbus was a Taino, whom Columbus named \"Guat\" (today spelled Guata). He quickly befriended and traded with the Taino tribe. Another thing that Columbus did find in the New World was gold. He thought that he had found India, and was hoping to find great gold treasure. He found that gold wasn't a problem to find, which excited him even more. He had found the New World, not just the old world. He had found a rich society that would become the main source of wealth for many colonists afterwards. As history shows us, there were many repercussions on the discovery of the Americas. The main negative effect was on the lives of the Native Americans who had no idea what was about to happen to them. They were used and treated poorly as they were seen as less than people. With the coming of European colonists, there was a conflict with the natives which ended up leading to the extinction of many tribes, and the destruction of many civilizations such as the Aztec, Mayan, and Inca. Another large negative effect was the lack of attention to the environment. The population boom which followed the discovery of the New World, brought about deforestation, land use changes, and the resulting environmental damage which included massive species extinction. Also there were many large effects from the discovery of the new world. One being a new source of treasure; gold and jewels....\nDiscovery of the New World Essay\n...The discovery of the New World. The discovery of the New World and the consequent voyages of discovering further, is one of the greatest moments in our world’s history, as it was of enormous importance to modern era, especially to the worldview and to the science of the 16th century. And even though Christopher Columbus is known by many to be the first person to discover the New World, but this is no real proof to be correct, as many other countries and sailors claimed to be first to find the New World, making their voyage in the 16th century or even later. One important aspect of discovering the New World is that even though many people may argue about the date, in which the New World was found, this fact still remained unchanged for all ages, that it was found. Before the discovery of the New World, many nations of Europe were in an expansion, and they were looking for new lands of wealth and of which would be an asset and a help in their future success. The main reason for this expansion is because of the Renaissance period of which gave birth to many new inventions and discoveries which improved our world’s knowledge and awareness, and the expansion of Europe into the new lands was mostly done thanks to those inventions which improved the transport"

Using the LCS algorithm on a pair of input strings s1, s2 with n and m elements, respectively, yields an output of length m or longer if s1 is lexicographically greater than s2. The problem is now fixed on GitHub and my local repository. The algorithm below is O(m) = O(n). The longest word in a string that occurs exactly in the string is known as the lexicographic-least-common-multiple-of-a-string (LLCMS). I am a novice in python, so any help would be appreciated. Note that we need to store the output, not modify it. The number of common substrings of the two strings, that are of equal length and are located at the same positions. It finds the common alphabet strings of the two given strings and returns the result. This article will explain the LCS Algorithm using Python Programming. The Common Ground tool is open. Python 2, 3. As mentioned in the previous chapter, LCS is one of the problems for which DP has a good solution.  The  indicates there is a problem. LCS Algorithm Description. 21 Python - Implementing the D - Meek-He. I'm using C++. The input file consists of a total of N lines. Python Programming LCS Algorithm is an implementation done in Python. The maximum number of bits that are set for the LCS problem is 30 bits. LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) is a dynamic programming problem using which it is easy to find longest common subsequence of a pair of strings (or arrays). com), the LCS problem is the following: Given two strings s1 and s2 find m, the longest common sequence of each. For example, the LCS algorithm would find a matching of \"AC\" over \"CAT,\" but it would fail to find a matching of \"CBAC\" over \"CAT\" (since both strings are 7-letter long). Use Python to write a program to solve the LCS problem for two strings. The LCS algorithm uses dynamic programming. You can add your own. How to Implement. The following diagram summarizes the way that the code solves the LCS problem of two strings. For the longest common subsequence the goal is to compare strings pairwise and find out the longest sequence of letters that occur in both strings. An implementation of the algorithm using Python. Here is my implementation which uses python 3. The code for LCS (Longest common sub sequence) problem is available at the following GitHub repository. For instance, \"cat\", \"sat\", and \"at\" all have a LCS of length 4. The LCS is the sequence that is the same in both strings. 16, 12, -1),. It assumes the two strings are of a fixed. I have gone through many websites and StackOverflow threads about Python coding style (including coding standards for Microsoft) and couldn’t come to solid conclusion about. In this article we are going to see how to find the longest common subsequence with python and then how to find longest common subsequence with Java. To get the next longest sequence and so on, we need to start at the previous length plus 1 and go down in the. The maximum number of bits that are set for the LCS problem is 30 bits. You can check out my latest coding eBook: Learn Python, A Hacker's Guide:. I would appreciate if you could send me the source code. The algorithm is called Linear. In this tutorial, we are going to explain the above method using python language. LCS of 2 string of 10 char. For instance, the longest common subsequence of the strings \"cat\" and \"sat\" is the sequence \"sat\" in both strings. Common Subsequence Example: For ex. This implementation is O(m x n) since, for each character 'a' the string is checked against each character 'b' up to 'n' to see if it matches for m. LCS algorithm in python.

That is, the slope is constant, and the value of the slope is equal to the derivative of the function at that particular point. These points are called points of inflection. You will learn to find.\nA function can be represented as [latex] f \\left( x \\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}g\\left (t\\right). [/latex]\nEvaluating a Derivative by the Rule-of-Sines\nThus, a function defined by the relation [latex]f(x)= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}g\\left (t\\right) [/latex] may have the property [latex] f(x)=0 \\iff g (t)= 0 . [/latex] The function defined by this relation is called a derivative of the function f. If the derivative function f has domain and range contained in the interval [latex] I=\\left(b-r, a+r \\right) [/latex], then the function f is said to be continuous on [latex] I [/latex], and we can use the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative function f.\nA derivation is the finding and interpreting the derivative.\nThe derivative of a function is an expression that is the slope of the tangent line at a given value of x in the domain of the function.\nThe derivative tells us how values of f change in response to changes in values of x. In other words, for a given value of x (say x=1) the derivative for f tells us how fast, and in what direction, the value of f (say f(x)=2) is changing.\nFunctions have a slope at any instant. The slope of a function is the instantaneous slope at [math]x[/math] where the derivative of the function is zero (where [math]x[/math] is critical or where a tangent is at a critical value).\nCalculating a Derivative by the Derivative Rules\nThe derivative must always be positive, negative, or equal to zero. Positive and negative derivatives occur when we differentiate up and down. That is, we take a value that is large, make it smaller, and then make it smaller, or make it larger. These derivatives are not the same as those for up or down. They are the same as those of an exponential, which is, e^(ax), where [math]a[/math] is a"

If you could share a little bit about this email (or template) so that I can better understand what kind of information I should be looking for? thanks for your time!\nHello I am a teacher and my students are very fascinated about your work. We are planning to visit your company in the near future in order to organize a trip to the plant. I also want to know your prefered timings and the best way of contacting your company. Looking forward to hearing your response. With kindest regards, Rakesia Bhurji\nHi, i was just wondering if Uralkali is owned by Russian govt. or private organisations ???? and why uralkali is in trouble now??? can u plz mail me answers on that ? thanking u in return\nThe reason why the saline-saturated groundwater is coming up is actually the \"wetness\" of the ground. The ground is essentially the water table, so as you remove more water from underground, the place is left more dried up. The water from the water table is not just pure water and has natural chemicals like salts and other minerals in it. This groundwater is already there in the form of liquid water, so its only evaporation that causes a higher concentration of dissolved solids. You won't get something like that from the fresh water you get by tapping a natural spring, where the water coming out is almost pure, or at least has no salts. So this is probably the result of over extraction. The chemical concentration of the stuff that's going up, might simply be the result that these natural chemicals are dissolved in most of the water, and the water coming to the surface now can no longer hold these chemicals in solution. The concentration of dissolved solids comes from this, and a lower water saturation. But I really can't tell more, since its not so much my field of expertise.\nDo you know if the salination of the rivers is due to the overuse of fertilizers (or other factors)?\nCan you please let me know the process of extraction used by you? How deep the wells are put? What kind of chemicals are used by the company? Is this just a \"wash\" technique? Would you mind to let me know the amount of productivity per day?\nMost of our production comes from the deep \"Well No. 45\". Well 45 is a very deep well with a water level of over 200 meters and a pressure of above 100 atmospheres. The length of the well is about 900 meters, and the diameter is 2 meters. The length of the well, when it will be complete, will be 2900 meters. We do use chemicals to extract phosphate and potash, but it is only about 0.1% of the total cost for production. It is approximately a wash technique. I'm not sure of how much the daily productivity is.\nDo you have an email address that I can use to contact you if I wanted to?\nYou can contact me at: andrei.kondratenko@uralkali.com.\nCan you please let me know how deep are these wells? What is the length of the well once it's complete? How many meters deep does it currently go?\nWell No. 45 currently is 950 meters deep and is still at the construction stage. It is planned to be 2900 meters deep once complete (we are about 900 meters now)\nSo I really understand that the problems is in the water table and it is getting salty , but what is the reason? When you have a river that is saturated with minerals then normally you would dig deep wells to find the minerals , now because we have salts , is it possible to make a desalination process ? I heard that there are places where they use solar panels to produce electricity and at the same time they use this electricity to produce desalinate the seawater ; is it possible to make desalinization plants without solar panels ?\nI am also interested in contacting a potential business partner but I do not know how can I do that? Is there an email address that I can use to contact you if I wanted to?\nThe concentrations of salts in the groundwater are getting higher and higher (that means the water in the wells is becoming more salty) because the wells are getting deeper and the water table is becoming more saline. The wells are about 100 meters deep now. When the level of water table will reach"

Page 25\n27 Case Study: Delivering Customer Satisfaction Delivering Customer Satisfaction is a 1-hour training module and was developed to assist employees involved in customer service to gain an understanding of customer expectations and the importance of managing customer relationships to gain customer satisfaction. It also provides practical advice on how to deliver outstanding customer service. A 30- minute training module which will provide employees who deal with customers with an understanding of the customer journey and how customers experience and measure service. The customer journey is made up of 5 stages: Recognition: at this stage customers recognise the company or organisation. The company or organisation has therefore already started to work on their customer image. Interest: At this stage customers consider the company or organisation on both professional and social terms. At Interest customers are also looking at whether they can do business with the company. Service: At this stage customers interact with the company or organisation to either find out what they have to offer or to buy a product or service. At Service, customers are looking for a quick response or resolution which helps them to make their decision to deal with the company. Sustaining: At this stage customers keep dealing with the company because the company is fulfilling their needs in a consistent way. This is where the relationship between the customer and the company or organisation starts to become developed. Loyalty: At this stage customers are committed to dealing with the company in preference to the competition. The module includes a quiz (or a questionnaire) at the end of each module. This should be completed by any employee dealing with customers whether at face-face, or over the phone. Once completed by all employees, the module manager can produce a summary report showing the percentages of correct responses given by each level of employees (e.g. Managers, Supervisors, Team Leaders). The module manager can then use this as a training plan. Incorporating the training modules is easy as they do not require specific planning. They can be delivered as and when needed. The customer service assessment (or questionnaire) can incorporate information from the customer-service plan. This is an effective way of measuring the performance on the customer journey, or any customer specific objectives.

You have to take care of your most urgent and long-term things, and not try to do it all at once. It's just not feasible. So look at your list. If a goal doesn't have a deadline, get a deadline. If it has a deadline, then mark your calendar with dates for reaching those goals.\nWhen do you create deadlines? It's a great idea to create \"mini–deadlines\" as you go along. These mini–deadlines force you to consider your goals every day. And if you don't \"succeed\" at the goal that day, maybe in the long run that's a good thing. Sometimes success requires you to acknowledge that you failed that day and to try to find a way to succeed the next day, and then the next day. That's how you'll get closer to achieving your goals.\nIt's also a good idea to take a step back every few months to take stock of where you are and where you could be. Take five minutes every two weeks to write down your goals and where you are with them. If you've accomplished one thing, congratulate yourself. If you haven't, come up with creative solutions to keep moving forward.\nOnce you have a few mini–deadlines that might help you accomplish an overarching goal on your long-term list, start working from the top down. Start with those three- to six-month deadlines. You can probably knock that part of your long-term list out in a month or two or within a few months of the deadline if you're really motivated and work from eight to eight and don't waste any time.\nBy this time, it's probably pretty clear to you which of your goals are the most important to you. You'll probably even start to see trends coming into play. Maybe you want to get a book published. But what kinds of books do you want to write? Do you want to publish e-books and reach a huge global audience? If so, you need to start thinking about the digital publishing world. How are you going to create content, where is that content going to live, how will you keep track of it all, and what social media tools do you need to reach readers?\nAre you actually going to publish a physical book, and the success of which has a lot to do with where you're going to publish it, who's going to distribute it, how you're going to promote it, what will you charge for it, and how will you sell it?\nMaybe you want to write a magazine article. It's a good idea to start considering journalism school as a possible next step because it teaches you how to get your work into print, how to write well in general, and how to understand the mechanics of being a writer. But maybe you decided in the next year that you want to start a magazine for people in an industry that you have expertise in.\nMaybe what you want to do is start a blog with other people. What kind of blog? What will you contribute in the way of content? Will you share and repost others' blog content, or will you write your own stuff?\nMaybe what you want to do is start a book club. How will you find other people who want to start a book club, and how will you reach them?"
